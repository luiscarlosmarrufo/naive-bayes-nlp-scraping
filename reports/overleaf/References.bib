  abstract = 	 {This paper empirically compares the performance of four probabilistic models for text classification - Poisson, Bernoulli, Multinomial and Negative Binomial. We examine the "naive Bayes" assumption in the four models and show that the multinomial model is a modified naive Bayes Poisson model that assumes independence of document length and document class. Despite the fact that this last assumption might not be correct in many situations, we find that, in general, relaxing it does not change the performance of the classifier. Finally we propose and evaluate an ad-hoc method for incorporating document length.},
