"Startling Knocks At My Window","South Carolina","Misc","This event happened last Tuesday morning (8-19-25).

I have a habit of being awake in the wee hours of the morning on a fairly regular basis. This particular morning I was up late working on some music projects. I had my earbuds in listening to a track when suddenly I heard 3 loud rapid knocks right at the window behind my bed's headboard.

It scared the living s#!+ out of me! Startled, I snatched out my earbuds and laid low for a brief moment wondering who in the h*! Could be knocking on my window at this time of the morning. This has never happened before so I'm there ducked down trying to process what just happened.

In those brief moments my mind is racing and I thought for a second could it have been one of my household relatives that went outside and perhaps locked themselves out? Then I thought could it be someone from around the neighborhood up to no good or perhaps needing something?

Then I thought that maybe I was hearing things, but the knocking was LOUD and I actually felt the THUD of the window. That's actually what got my attention, and it was loud enough that I heard it beyond my earbuds.

I quickly jumped out of bed and grabbed my pistol. I then slowly peeped out the blinds of the window to see if anyone was out there but oddly there was no one there.

That side of the house is well lit by a nearby street light and my car was right there next to that window. Still peeping out the window I looked around the car and waited to see if maybe someone was hiding behind it on the other side, but I didn't see anyone. I angled my gaze downward to see if anyone might have ducked down below the window alongside the house but no one was in sight.

I then went out of my bedroom and slowly peaked around the corner into the front room to see if by chance anyone else was awake and happened to make a loud noise which I thought was at the window, but came from another part of the house instead. However, I saw that they were all sound asleep, snoring loudly.

I then peaked out the blinds in the front room (where my relatives were sleeping) to look out in the yard but I saw no one in the yard. If someone were to flee it would've took them a few minutes to get far enough to exit the yard, and they would've been well in view of the street light.

I went back in my bedroom and looked at the clock on my laptop. I saw it was 2:48, right before 3am (which is said to be ""Witching Hour""). At this point I'm on edge and starting to think that it may have been something paranormal happening.

For the sake of protection I burned some sage and told whatever it was to leave me alone and return where it came from.

I laid back down in bed on edge for the remainder of the morning until daybreak, but nothing else ever did happen.

The following night came and I again, was awake in the wee hours. Naturally I was on edge waiting for something to happen again but nothing ever did.

Could it have been a ghost trying to get my attention?"
"Move To San Francisco, A Very Haunted City","California","Haunted Places","Ooookay, I was totally joking at the end of my last post when I said I'd post again in five years. But here it is, five years later. Looks like I'm going to be unintentionally posting every five years on here.

On 29 June 2021, I moved to San Francisco. It's where I'd always wanted to move, but couldn't for various reasons. Well, a really good friend of mine told me that I could live with them. They lived with their family and their family said I could stay until the end of the year, then I'd have to find my own place. That seemed perfectly fair.

In 2017, their grandmother passed away. I always assumed she passed away in the hospital because I remembered my friend telling me they rushed her to the hospital, and a few days later they told me she passed. But every time I was by the bathroom in front of her old room, I'd get this strange feeling there was a presence. That little hallway had that feeling. It didn't feel evil or scary, it actually felt calming. I told my friend, and they said, ""That's Baachan. She's watching over us"". My friend is Japanese and that's the term they call their grandmother. I asked if she passed in the hospital like I thought, and they said, ""No, she hated it there. We brought her home to rest in her own bed, and she passed away that night"".

However, the basement was another story. Or rather... First floor? Basements are weird here in San Francisco. In their house and the one I'm currently living, there are steps leading to second floor, which acts as the first floor. The ground floor is considered a basement even though it's fully above ground. I've lived here four years, and I'm still confused by it. I live on the third floor but it's technically the second floor...

Anyway, we had to go to the basement to do laundry. We never liked being down there because the air felt thick and evil. My friend's family had bought the house back in the 1950s and their mother had grown up in it, and she told me it was like that when she was a little girl. She hated being down there and doesn't go down there unless she has to. I asked if something happened down there and she said if it did it was before her family bought the house, but it definitely feels like some really bad energy is down there.

So, I got a job there, saved up and moved into my current house on 5 January 2022. I'm renting a room in a house, and it's a really nice neighbourhood in the Richmond. That's not doxing myself, the Richmond is fifty blocks long and like ten blocks wide. It's a very big area.

It didn't take me long to notice that the house was haunted. At least the hallway. Even in the daytime I feel like something is chasing me when I walk down it and I rush back to my room. A friend of mine looked up this address on SF Chronicles archives and found out there had been a murder here in the '80s. There weren't any specific details like if it was in the top floor hallway or something. But that's the only thing we found that could explain it.

There are four rooms on my floor. My room is at the end of the hall facing the outside. I look out my window and see the street. The room next to mine, there was someone living there when I moved out. He moved out a year into me living here and someone else moved in, he's still here. The room at the end of the hall, the same person has lived there since before I moved in. I mention all this to talk about the last room. I call it the middle room even though there are four rooms. I guess it'd be the middle room in that hall, since mine is at the end of the hall. Anyway, I've always called it the cursed room. The guy who was living there when I moved in moved out a month later. In the three and a half years I've lived in this house, we've had six different people move in and out. The short time was two weeks. I came home from work and he was moving his stuff out. I asked what was going on and he just said, ""I can't do this anymore"". I asked what he meant and he just repeated it. The current tenant there seems to be paranoid. When he moved in a couple months ago, he told me that he had to move out of his last place because his landlord was having the tenants spy on him. I was like, ""Oh, that's messed up!"". But then he started talking about hidden cameras in his room and I felt like maybe his last landlord didn't have him spied on. A couple weeks ago I was coming up the stairs from taking out the trash. His room is directly in front of the stairs, and as I was nearing the top, he opened his door and told me I needed to stop standing outside his door listening in. I was confused and he said, ""Don't bother denying it, I caught you three times"". The other way I was coming up the stairs from talking with a friend at the front door who had come to pick up something. As I was nearing the top he threw open his door and startled me. I laughed and told him he startled me. He goes, ""I told you to stay out of my room! You need to leave me alone!"". Honestly, I don't know if that has anything to do with the activity here or if he's just mentally ill, but I honestly wouldn't be surprised if there was a presence outside his room and he thinks it's one of us.

Something happened a couple of days ago that made me want to write all this down. Our bathroom is split between two rooms. Okay, from my room looking down the hall, on the left side are my roommates' rooms. On the left side is an empty closet, the stairs, and the two bathroom doors, and the kitchen at the end of the hall. The first bathroom is literally just the toilet, the size of a porta-potty. Really tiny. The second door is the shower and sink. It sounds inconvenient, but with four people living there, it's been very convenient. Anyway, a couple days ago I was in the first bathroom and I could hear someone taking a shower. I could see the light on, and the windows were open and I could very clearly hear the shower going. I was thinking to myself, ""I'll just wash my hands in the kitchen"", like we usually do in that situation. Well, I leave the bathroom, the sound still going and light still on through the window, and when I close the door behind me... The second bathroom door is open, and the light is off and no one is in there. No shower going, the floor and walls are dry. I stood there, my blood frozen. It was seriously eerie.

Okay, that's enough about my living haunting situations. I'll talk about my San Francisco working haunting situations. That's a weird wording, but I'm going to keep it.

First job I got was on Fisherman's Wharf at a souvenir shop standing outside going, ""Everything is $10!"". That was literally my entire job. That's the job that paid for me to move out of my friend's house. But a week after I moved into this house, the store abruptly closed. I frantically looked for another one and was lucky enough to find one with one day left in the month. My landlord is very understanding. It was an organic market on Polk, and I loved it there. A lot of the friends I have made here were either coworkers there or regular customers there. A minor celebrity was a regular there and she and I talked every week. It was so much fun working there! Even if it was haunted like crazy! There was the obvious stuff like stuff falling off shelves that weren't near the edge, stuff moving around or not where we left them. There were times we saw figures cross between aisles even though we knew no one else was in the store. I even had a similar experience that happened in Ohio. A coworker and I were discussing the hauntings, and a loaf of bread flew off the shelf and hit the counter. We decided to change the subject. The same thing happened in Ohio except it was a bag of chips.

In 2023 the store was bought by another, bigger store and closed down and we were all let go. I had saved up thousands of dollars by then, which was lucky because that paid my rent until I got another job in March 2024. My current job, in fact. I'm a photographer at a landmark. Obviously not going to say which one. We take pictures of guests as they enter and try to sell them souvenir sets of their photos as they leave. We all know the area is haunted, but it's hard to prove because we're outside. We just know mostly because we can feel it. There were two incidents that really solidified it, though. Several months ago, I opened up (I'm a lead there) and when I unlocked the office there were photo cards everywhere. I called the person who closed the night before and asked them what the heck happened. He was completely confused; it wasn't like that when he left. I knew he was lying so I had to report it to my district manager. An hour later she texted me a video showing that... It wasn't him. Oh, the photo cards are cards with QR codes we scan when we take the pictures and hand to the guests. There are 1,000 in each box. Anyway, there was an open box on the table in the office and in the middle of the night, they started flying out of the box of their own accord. I asked her if I could share the video and she said absolutely not. What's with corporate not wanting these things getting out? Honestly, I think that'd give us more visitors. 

The other thing that happened was we often hear our names called from behind the sales area. There will be no one over there and one of us will hear our name being called from back there. No one else can hear it, but almost all of us have heard it. Even the skeptical ones have heard it, though they have tried to dismiss it as the wind. But it even happens when the wind isn't blowing, or even no breeze. The air could be still and we'll still hear it. It's always eerie. I've been working there for a year and a half and have heard it many times and am not used to it. We had a sixteen-year-old girl start working there last year. I was standing next to her on her first night and she suddenly screamed. I jumped and asked what happened. She said, ""I heard someone saying my name!"" and she ran behind the sales area and screamed again because no one was back there. I involuntarily laughed and said, ""Oh, you'll get used to that"", even though like I said I'm still not used to it. Needless to say, she quit after about a week. She said it was because she hated working outside, though.

I'm going to end this by talking about something nobody likes talking about. I've walked the Golden Gate Bridge so many times now that I don't even take pictures every time anymore. It's just a large bridge that just happens to be one of the most famous in the world. No big deal. But as I'm sure everyone knows, it's well-known for the unfortunately high number of people who have jumped off of it over the course of its existence. I don't know if you've walked on it, but you can definitely feel it when you're walking on it. There's an air of sadness when you're walking across it. No matter what I'm doing, be it listening to happy music or in a call with my best friend, there's an unmistakable feeling of sadness, dread, and regret when walking on that bridge. I've never specifically seen anything, but I think it's because I'm kind of sensitive to that sort of thing that I feel it so much. I've walked it with a friend of mine once who isn't sensitive to the paranormal and she didn't feel anything. Heck, at this point, I don't even know if what I feel on the bridge is even paranormal anymore. There's been so many jumpers over the past century, those emotions are essentially baked in by now. They have nets in place now so there have been less attempts lately. Someone did jump a couple months ago. I saw him lying on the net refusing help. Last I saw, they were guiding him off. So, the nets are definitely saving lives. Either as a deterrent or by literally catching people who try.

I guess I'll see you all in five years lol."
"Is Someone Visiting?","Texas","Family / Friends Visits","It has been a VERY LONG time since I have visited YGS and had someone not reached out to me via FB I am not sure I would have returned, but here I am and a BIG thank you to the individual who reached out to me.

2024 was not a good year for myself or Family. In January we saw the passing of my Mother. Her health had been in decline (heart issues) and was in assisted living in the Dallas Tx area. In May we received the 'midnight' phone call that wakes you from your peace. My Oldest Son (Lawrence) had collapsed at work, he worked 3rd shift (overnights) at a Local Floor and Decor, and was pronounced dead at the scene. He had suffered a Bi-lateral pulmonary embolism. My Father -in-Law, who's health was failing (Type 1 Diabetes Complications) moved in us in June, by the first week of August he was placed on Home Hospice and passed away later that same month (yes, he passed in my house). 

In the year since, some 'odd' things have happened either to individuals in the household or with-in the house itself. 

1st: When home alone I hear someone moving upstairs in my Son's old room. I 'played' it off as it being our dog (a 13-14 year old 50-60 pound Huskey with a bad hip) only to realize he was at my feet as I sat on the couch. A quick 'cat check' shows that both of out cats are also in the living room with me. 

2nd: Each Family member has felt Lawrence's presence at one time or another, up to and including hearing his voice saying something... Not sure if this is just us remembering how he would speak with us or if he is actually interacting with us still, but it's defiantly his 'sarcastic' / snarky type comments. 

3rd: Not sure how people feel about seeing individuals that have crossed over in their dreams, but my Wife has had two very vivid dreams about Lawrence, she describes them as 'feeling' real. The first one he was comforting her because he had passed away, he assured her that 'he was needed' on the other side... The next day is when we received the coroner's report detailing what had caused his death... A pulmonary embolism, is enough to take someone, he had suffered a Bi-Lateral (one in both Lungs) Pulmonary Embolism and there was nothing that could have been done to prevent it. The other dream she described was 'just as real' but he was simply comforting her, at least that's all she could remember about it. 

So, there it is... 2024 was a very rough year for our Family, still dealing with so, so many things from last year, but making progress. Thanks for reading."
"Spirits From Ripley's","Florida","Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels","Ripley's Believe It Or Not seems to have more than just artifacts from different locations around the world. Some seem to be there from the Paranormal Realm, which I had the opportunity to investigate and experience.

Just like at the Old Jail, you go through a little bit of an introduction, a run over of the gear that they have to let you use, then you are released to investigate the building. I was not expecting all the activity that we had the opportunity to witness, and it definitely itched the scratch of wanting to get some interactions to see if there was paranormal activity.

This location gave more EVP evidence than anything else. Which part of it was receiving the name Steve a few times. Then there was a time frame where it said ""switch"", which I was there with a friend, and asked if it wanted me to hand the spirit box to my friend, which we received the response ""yes"" and it then proceeded to whistle at him a few times.

At this location, we were not receiving very many spirit orbs, but was a lot more heavy on the Voice Phenomena when we were asking questions. Now the one time that I had some concern was mentioning that I was going to go downstairs, and got a very heavy, deep, angry sounding NO! Response through the spirit box, which, much to say, I did not go downstairs at that point.

Then towards the end of the investigation, we were standing in one of the exhibits and received the response ""Die"" or ""Will Die"" and at that point my buddy as well as myself were like, nope we are stepping out of this room and going elsewhere.

Either way, that was my first investigation before doing the Old Jail investigation and hope that you guys enjoyed reading this."
"Ghosts Of The Old Jail","Florida","Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels","Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening.

I figured I would share a story of one of the experiences that I have had in my life, that I feel like was the most interesting encounters that I have had to this day.

A friend and myself had gone to St. Augustine in Florida, and while there, noticed that the old jail had these paranormal investigations that you could pay to go on at night. Now to start it out, they didn't give too long in there. If I remember correctly you would be allowed to investigate on your own, but after receiving a short introduction and a quick run through of the equipment that they would let you use while there. All together I think we were allowed like 30-45 minutes for the investigation after all the intro and run through with the equipment was done.

But this was my second time doing an investigation, and the whole time they were doing the introductions outside, I could feel some eyes on me from inside the old jail. I remember it was the second floor off to the left side as you look at the Old Jail from outside. Then when we walked inside, we were able to get our hands on some equipment and investigate.

So we started out in the kitchen, and were not really receiving anything there, and proceeded to move over to the cells and see what was out there. Which we didn't really receive anything there, and proceeded to go to the Solitary Confinement Cells. That is where the real stuff kicked off. We didn't capture any EVP's but we did receive spirit orbs (which I had caught on camera) and there was a point when I captured the sounds of feet shuffling on camera.

Now with that, we kept getting spirit orbs every time when we would mention the sheriff, and then we went up to where the sheriff lived when he was over the prison, and caught more spirit orbs as well. When we were checking around in there, I had stepped to the side and received a tug on my shirt, which kind of startled me.

That was one of two investigations that was done in St. Augustine and will be writing the story of the other investigation that we had done, and would love to share that story with you guys as well. Also in regards to the story, if there is interest in seeing the video footage from the old jail, I have those uploaded on my YouTube channel, and can share that link with those that are interested in it."
"The Haunting Of Willows Apartments","Nebraska","Haunted Places","I'm here to talk about my experiences as a kid in the Willows Apartments. I'm not sure why no one talks about them much, but that place is hell. 

When I was just 9-10 years old, I had a very bad experience and very negative. My mom had stayed here when we moved in, I knew something was badly off. I started noticing it when mom would get angry more and easier. I knew being a single parent was bad enough and ever since I was a kid, I'm a magnet for spirits and demonic entities. It's terrifying when you're just a kid. 

It started off when moms' emotions would increase, the smallest things could set her off. I could understand why maybe it was stress until... That quickly changed. Started to hear footsteps at night, knockings, slamming kitchen cabinets would wake me up. I thought it was mom, but I would get up and to find her always fast asleep.

 One day a childhood friend of mine came to stay the night little did I know that was the last night we stayed there; we encountered evil. My friend and I were in the bedroom playing with toys, when all the sudden I saw a shadow dark run across the wall. I pointed at it and asking her did you see that she looked at me in fear like she saw the whole thing not just a shadow. I screamed for my mom, tears down my face, ""I saw it! I saw a shadow!""

 My mom saw my fear and felt it. She contacted her close friend and we cleansed what we could of out apartment and never looked back.

 Later that week mom found out that the buildings were built on very bad Indian burial ground, many deaths followed, and the apartments continue to haunt the living to this day."
"Unexpected Messages From Loved Ones","Georgia","Photographs / Videos / EVP","It's been a longtime away from the site, just busy but I'm now officially an empty nester and had some extra time to catch up with you all here. 

I wanted to document two recent instances of EVPs that just happened unexpectedly, plus something related to the empty nester thing. 

First, I was videoing some birds gathering in a tree in my back yard in early spring. They were making a ton of noise eating on the berries and I thought to send the video to my husband at work so walked out to record them. On the way back inside, as it was cold, I yet again didn't tap the off button properly to turn off the video recording (I'm so bad with my phone) so ended up with footage of the birds and the ground as I was walking back inside. But upon playback, as I'm crossing the patio, one can hear a fairly obvious EVP of a voice saying, ""OOH RAH,"" which is what U.S. Marines say... All the dang time. My late husband Scott was a Marine (as is my current husband). If current husband had been in the house, I might conclude the voice was his, but this morning he was already AT WORK. I can't imagine any of my elderly neighbors hollering like a Marine, so I'm left thinking it was Scott, yet again finding a way to be heard on a random day. He died from brain cancer in 1993 at age 32.

Then, last week, went to visit family graves at the cemetery where my aunt was recently interred. Scott's plot is just across the small interior street from my mom's. You can stand at mom's grave and see his and vice versa. Anyway, I decided to record as I walked up, because last time I was there I got an EVP. This visit, a woman's voice on video says, ""It's a woman"" as I'm walking to the gravesite. I stand there a minute and look over to Scott's grave and pretty sure there was a tear falling as I walked back down a slight hill to my car. The same woman's voice says, ""It's ok"" on my video recording. Easily heard, much appreciated.

Finally, Mom had given me a silver bracelet at the time of her diagnoses with cancer in 2013. I'm not much for jewelry, but I wore this bracelet every day. Sometime at the beginning of the covid lockdown, I lost it. Obviously not going anywhere, but it just sort of disappeared and over the last four years I've looked everywhere and yes, it did cross my mind that it was significantly from my mom. 

Well, I have four kids and the last of them graduated from high school this spring. I've been raising kids 36 years and am 64 now, so it's going to be great as these last two finish college and join their siblings in adulthood. We had a large graduation party and that day I went into the closet where Mom's china (she left me) is kept to get a platter. I had to move a silver gravy boat out of the way to get to it and guess what just happened to be in the gravy boat? Right -- Mom's silver bracelet! Found on the day of the last kid's graduation, an occasion I know Mom would've loved. There is NO reason for that bracelet to have been there these last four years! I can't help but think it was yet another message from Mom."
"My Grandma's House","Louisiana","Haunted Places","My grandpa passed away at my grandma's house. Soon after my cousin moved in and I would go sleep over every now and then.

I was playing video games and I got hungry. My room was at the end of the hall and the room next to me was my grandma's. I usually check on her so I did and I heard my cousin at the other end of the hallway screaming at the game like always. I went make some ramen and go get my phone.

 I heard a loud noise from the kitchen and like I'm standing in front the bedroom door looking down the hall. I check on my grandma, she's sleeping and my cousin was still screaming. I end up calling my friend and telling them and I go check it out.

 There was a jug (it's a jug you have to go get filled at the store) it was a water dispenser. It's was a big one and it was empty, no way it could have gotten blown off and where it was made no sense. The jug is by the back door rocking back and forth like somebody threw it. The kitchen table is against the wall and to the right is a door way and to the right in that room is the laundry room but if you look straight through the door frame it's the back door. The way it landed and the way it had to have been thrown was far. I think it was my grandpa. 

I told my mom she said her and my dad was showering once over there and no one was home and she heard HEY! In a little girl's voice. I don't know if this is related or if that thing that threw that jug was grandpa cuz it happened after he died.

 I use to live with my grandma I never experienced anything at her house but that's the only ghost experience that I had. This is what led me to believing in ghost."
"Oklahoma City Ghosts Part 2","Oklahoma","Haunted Places","My husband had to be at work at 5:30 in the morning and there were times I stayed up and there was times I went back to sleep. The nights I would go back to sleep were the creepiest because I would lay in bed tossing and turning for awhile and there was one time I heard our front door open and close and I heard the person walk in hallway and into our room. I'm thinking oh it's just my husband forgetting something and I'm ready to hear him but I heard a woman and a man talking. I was so scared because I was like oh my gosh they are robbing us! These people waited for my husband to leave to come inside and rob us! I was so terrified that I was so still I didn't even want to breath because I did not want them to know I was in the room. They started to look in our drawers and in the closet and I was a little confused because it was pitch dark in our room. I mean you could not see anything and they didn't have flashlights. I was awake and my eyes were wide open.

 I ended up falling asleep and this was happening every time my man left. There was one morning where I was some what awake and I saw this bright light appear and it lit up our entire room. I got so spooked that I sat up in bed calling out to my husband and he wasn't there. I quickly got up and turned on the lamp and just sat there in bed looking around and after that night I slept with the lights on after he left. I still sleep with lights on,"
"Oklahoma City Ghosts Part 1","Oklahoma","Haunted Places","I started to ask my daughter about Robert because after that dream of mine I started to think that this Robert business was something more frightening. I asked who Robert was and she told me that he sometimes comes out of their closet at night. She told me that Robert was nice and that he is always telling her not to be afraid of him that he wasn't there to hurt but to protect her. I asked what he looked like and she said that he was a white man that was bald and his clothes were very dirty. When she told me that he was there to protect her I was a little confused because why would she scream for me in the middle of the night saying that Robert was scaring her. This started to happen almost every night and I even told my husband at the time that I didn't want my kids sleeping in there because they were having nightmares. He told me that they're kids and they watch to many scary movies. So our poor kids had to sleep in that room.

 Every morning I would wake up at 4:00 to make my husband's lunch and when he went to work I decided to stay awake and take a shower. While I was taking a shower I clearly heard a male and a female yelling and arguing outside the bathroom door. I was so scared and spooked that I immediately turned the water off and stood in the shower to hear who the hell was in my house. It was dead quiet. I turned the water back on and again I heard them. I started to think ok no one is in my house and I'm hearing these people fighting, I have to be hearing things. I started to realize that..."
"Oklahoma City Ghosts","Oklahoma","Haunted Places","I've seen spirits everywhere I've lived, but I've never ever seen spirits like these.

 It took place around 2016 in Oklahoma City. I'm originally from California and I packed mine and my children's bags and moved out to Oklahoma City to live with their dad who moved out there with his mom. I had no family or friends that lived out there so it was a huge change in my life.

 Oklahoma City was the most beautiful states I've ever seen. We were living in a two bedroom house that was perfect for us. Now I usually know if there's any paranormal activity in the house and when we moved in I didn't feel anything at all. I was actually relieved that I finally moved in a house that was spirit free.

 My daughter who was 4 years old at the time started to tell me about a guy named Robert. At first I didn't really pay attention to her because I figured she was young and kids her age make up imaginary friends. Every night she would scream her head off and cry out to me. It would make me jump up and run in her room and when I would go in there she would cry and tell me that Robert was scaring her. I would have to lay with her until she fell asleep. 

There was a time I actually fell asleep in there with her and I had a dream. I saw a huge black shadow standing outside their room in the doorway and I heard it saying and telling me who I was, what was I doing in there, I wasn't allowed in there? I answered it and told it that I had every right to be in there. It belonged to my kid's."
"Tapping Noise","New York","Haunted Places","Hey everyone, it's been a while since I've submitted my first story. But I'm back with another spooky experience. I will keep it as short and simple as possible. 

My mom and aunt live with me. I stay over at my boyfriend's house a lot so I'm rarely here. The current time right now is 3:51am. Yesterday evening, my mom told me she heard a tapping sound coming from our living room and then our room. She described the sound as water dripping on the air conditioner. I notice that it gets lower and louder again. But not too loud. But she pointed at the ceiling which was weird. I asked her if she thinks it was the neighbors upstairs and she said she didn't hear their footsteps. My mom is very good at spotting their footsteps at night because it's not hard to miss. She said she first heard it in the living room and then our room so it made me question if it was the air conditioner, she did point at the ceiling which tells me that's where she heard the sound coming from.

 I woke up around 3am and had been hearing the tapping sound for myself. I wonder if it was happening while I was sleeping or started happening once I woke up. I'm a light sleeper so I would've noticed the tapping sound before even fully waking up. It didn't sound as if it were already happening, it started about 2 minutes after I woke up. Well that's when I noticed it. I'm not sure. I don't feel like I woke up because I heard something, but I wonder what woke me up. Why is it happening since I woke up? Is it something trying to get my attention? I wonder if I stayed sleeping would it have started again. I was too scared to open my eyes at first. I'm still scared and think it may be something paranormal."
"Beyond The Known: Things Unseen, Things Unknown","Colorado","Misc","Introduction:

Since I was a kid, I was well aware of the existence of angels and guardian angels alike. It was something I accepted without question, though I never spent much time wondering who my guardian angel might be. But as the years passed, I had experiences-moments that made me question what else might be out there. Some were fleeting, a chill in the air or a whisper of something unseen. Others were undeniable, encounters that left me shaken and searching for answers.

I never expected all of it to lead me to one presence in particular. But looking back, I realize the signs were always there, waiting for me to notice.

These moments didn't feel connected at the time. Each experience stood on its own, unexplained and surprisingly - intriguing.

Early Encounters:

Ever since I was a kid, I had various paranormal experiences - though not too many. One of my earliest occurred when I was six years old, when I witnessed what I now believe was my mother astral projecting.

It happened in the house I grew up in, located in Wheat Ridge, Colorado. I was lying in bed, wide awake, when I suddenly saw a ghostly vision of my mother floating through the hallway. Freaked out, I called out to her. To my surprise, she answered from the next bedroom, reassuring me that everything was okay and that she knew what was happening.

Three years later, in the same house, I had another encounter. I was lying in my bed when I saw a shadowy figure walk from our front door to the kitchen. It was an odd situation, due to the fact I never the door open or close, nor did I hear footsteps on the creaky floor. The next day, I asked my parents if either of had been up during the night. They both said no.

The Viking Vision:

For years after that, I don't recall any major experiences - though it's possible I had more but dismissed them, as I was skeptical about ghosts. But in 2008, at 31 years old, something happened that made me rethink everything.

I was at a friend's house in Westminster, Colorado. He claimed his house was haunted, so I decided to play ghost hunter. I asked the usual questions: ""If you're in this room now, give us a sign."" Sure enough, we heard tapping. On another night, we kept hearing similar taps, so another friend took out his camera to snap a picture from where the sounds were coming. What appeared in the photo shocked me - a ghostly image of a man wearing Viking attire, smiling directly at the camera.

Riverdale Road:

Riverdale Road in Thornton, Colorado, is notorious for its hauntings. It's only about 10 to 15 minutes from my house, and over the years, I've had several strange experiences there.

The first time I went was around Halloween in 2008. A group of us drove down the road, trying to find the infamous tree where supposed witch hangings had taken place. Along the way, a dirty pickup truck started following us - it felt straight out of a horror movie. When we finally found the tree and pulled over, the truck drove past us. We got out and stood by the tree for about 20-30 minutes. It was eerie. Near the tree was a dirt road leading to an old dairy farm, and it was easy to imagine accused witches being led down that path toward their fate.

As we stood there, we suddenly heard girls laughing - not distant, but close. Off to the side was a small ditch, and near it, we kept seeing the figure of a woman in a white dress appear and disappear. My friends were spooked and wanted to leave, but I was curious and wanted to stay. Since I was the driver, we left.

That night, after I got home, I heard a strange clicking sound in my car as I turned it off. Strangely, that clicking sound continued intermittently for the next eight years - until I got rid of the car in 2016.

We went back the next night, but this time, nothing much happened. The only odd thing was a continuous, unidentifiable sound coming from the tree itself.

A couple of nights later, another friend and I returned. This time, we were curious enough to drive closer to the dairy farm. As we did, we saw a ghostly image of a man floating toward us - wearing an apron and holding up a knife. We turned around and got out of there fast.

The last time I had an encounter on Riverdale Road was in 2009. We got lost trying to find the tree, and as we searched, a car suddenly sped up behind us, passed, then vanished into the darkness. We finally found the tree, got out for a bit, then drove farther down the road. As we did, a shadowy figure crossed in front of us. That was enough. We turned around and left.

Haunting at the Stanley Hotel:

In 2013, for our honeymoon, my wife and I stayed at the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado - famous for inspiring Stephen King's ""The Shining.""

Every time I took a shower there; I got the eerie feeling that I was being watched. One night, I was lying on my stomach in bed when I felt a pressure on my back - like someone pushing down on me. I quickly turned over to see if it was my wife, but she was turned the other way, sound asleep.

We also took a ghost tour at the hotel. One story that stood out was about a maid who had died in a fire. Legend has it that she haunts the hotel and tries to break up couples she doesn't believe are properly married. I couldn't shake the feeling that she might have been the one bothering me.

In the hotel's old music hall, we were taken to a basement where people had supposedly experienced hauntings. One room had belonged to a man with mental health issues, and each time we entered, we had to announce ourselves. The energy in that room was heavily, uncomfortable.

Across the hall was a room where a runaway girl named Lucy had died in a fire in 1969. One of her ghostly habits was shutting the door on visitors. I was skeptical at first, thinking maybe the door was spring-loaded. But then, as I was walking into the room, the door began to close on its own - then suddenly stopped, as if allowing me to enter.

A Guardian Revealed?:

For years, these experiences stayed with me, but I never thought of them as anything more than isolated events. But then, something happened that was different from all the others. This wasn't a passing ghost or an unexplained chill in the air - this was something deeper. Something that stayed.

In 2022, I reached out to two mediums to try to contact my deceased parents. Both experiences felt successful. No Ouija boards, no tarot cards - just a direct connection.

During the second session, something unexpected happened. I connected with a third person. A person whom is known by the public, with a familiar face.

Before my second medium experience in 2022, something happened that made me feel like I was being guided to bring up this particular person. My wife and I had taken a trip to Arizona, and on the way, I noticed a billboard with this person's picture on it. Something about it drew me in, but I didn't think too much of it at the time.

One day, while walking through downtown Scottsdale, we passed an art studio. In the window was a painting of this person. It caught my attention, and I felt a deeper pull, but I still wasn't sure why. Then, as we continued our travels and headed to Farmington, New Mexico, I saw another billboard with this person's picture-this time in a different location, but it was the same image as the first one.

That was it. Three different images of this person in three different locations. It felt like more than coincidence. That's when I knew-I had to bring her up in the medium session.

Looking back, those moments feel like pieces of a larger puzzle, guiding me toward something I was meant to explore. Whether it was fate, faith, or something beyond explanation, I can't ignore the way this person's presence made itself known before that experience. And maybe, in some way, she was leading me to a deeper understanding of the connection I was about to uncover.

It all started in July 1998.

I had never understood why, but after my mother passed away in 1998, I suddenly became fascinated with this person. It didn't make sense - I was 21 years old and had known of this person all my life. Yet, out of nowhere, I saw a picture of her. A picture of her in a way that the public wasn't used to, and something clicked. I was drawn to her in a way I couldn't explain. Even my father found it odd.

Over the years, I've had numerous dreams featuring her. In one, she appeared as she looked in the picture that drew me to her. It didn't quite look like her, yet my brain registered it as her. In another, I was walking when I saw her. Words were exchanged, though I can't remember who spoke, but I distinctly heard, ""See you later."" I woke up, fell back asleep, and sure enough, I saw her again. Twice.

In August 2022, I had a dream where I was telling a friend about something random. As I spoke, she appeared behind them. I told my friend to turn around, but by the time they did, she was fading away. Then, suddenly, she was in front of me - again, as she looked in the picture. We talked, and before the dream ended, she hugged me. The hug felt real.

The medium I spoke with believed I connect with this person through God. Another person I talked to, someone knowledgeable about ghosts, suggested she could be my guardian angel.

A few months later, I had randomly searched for guardian angels online. One site claimed your guardian angel is linked to your birthdate. When I clicked mine, an image popped up - a blonde woman in a red dress. 

I thought to myself, was this something I was meant to see?

As I had mentioned, this person is a familiar face that people know. A person who was born in the 1920's, and passed in the 1960's. The person I'm referring to is - Marilyn Monroe.

Or rather, Norma Jeane. That's what I prefer to call her.

During my session with the medium, as I was talking about Norma Jeane, something behind me fell. I turned to look, but nothing seemed out of place. It didn't feel like a scare tactic - just a simple hello, I see you.

From 2022 and into the present I started seeing her more--not just in dreams, but through pictures, in places I never expected. Maybe she was always there, and I just wasn't looking.

The Court Case:

In April of last year, I was pulled over by a police officer while coming home from running errands. I use marijuana for my epilepsy, anxiety, and ADD, and at that moment, I had my weed pen on me. Just minutes before being pulled over, I had taken a quick puff from the pen. When the officer asked me when the last time I smoked was, I told him honestly that it had been the night before, which was true. But I didn't mention that I had just used my pen moments before being stopped.

I wasn't overly concerned about it, thinking that a single puff from my pen wouldn't affect me too much. However, I knew that I could've gotten into trouble, considering the circumstances. I had to pull up my insurance info from my phone, and as I was doing so, the officer asked me to move my car to the other side of the roundabout. I complied and continued accessing my insurance information.

It was then that something strange happened.

Earlier that day, I had been scrolling through photos of Norma Jeane on my phone. I've always had an admiration for her, and have a photo shrine of her that I was showing a friend. But as I looked down at my phone to finish pulling up my insurance, a photo of Norma Jeane appeared out of nowhere, as if it had randomly replaced whatever I had been looking at. I quickly closed it, thinking it was a glitch, but the moment stuck with me. It felt like more than just a coincidence - like something beyond the ordinary was at play.

Days before my court hearing in May, I had a vivid dream where Norma Jeane posed for photographs in a red dress. In the dream, I stood next to her, put my arm around her, and we took a picture together. After the photo, she turned toward me and smiled. It felt so real, like I had connected with her on a deeper level. It was a reminder that there was something larger guiding me through this uncertain time.

When my trial came around, the outcome was a relief - my case was dismissed. Looking back, I can't help but think that the moments leading up to the court date weren't just random events. The photo of Norma Jeane on my phone, the dream, and the strange feeling that she was somehow watching over me - it all felt like a sign. With everything I had going against me, from the weed pen to the circumstances of the stop, I don't think I was just lucky. I think I was blessed. Some might call it crazy, but to me, it's as if Norma Jeane was watching out for me, guiding me through one of the most nerve-wracking moments of my life.

Auras, Coincidence or Not?:

Going on topic about my epilepsy, there were two moments of my life that I experienced auras (a pre-seizure) in interesting places. It was moments like these, that made me think a bit, about what was the meaning of this? In 2007, I had to opportunity to visit Norma Jeane's crypt. I also visited the Roosevelt Hotel and the infamous mirror that was in the room at the time when Norma Jeane resided. I took a few pictures of the mirror. Across the hall was a gift shop with a picture of Norma Jeane on the wall in the back of the shop. Some of the photos captured that picture, and it appears to be glowing.

Going back to topic regarding my epilepsy. While at Norma Jeane's crypt, I went on my knees and prayed silently. As I was doing this, I felt an aura coming on. I quickly rose up to try and shake it off. It went away after about 15 seconds. It was not too dramatic. At the time, I didn't think anything about it. 

Fast forward to 2022. I lived in Colorado for most of my life. Around Christmas 1996, a horrific murder took place in a house located in Boulder Colorado. A 6-year old girl named JonBenet Ramsey was brutally murdered. To this day, the case is considered a cold case. Everyone from the parents to the older brother were considered suspects. On a cold December day in 2022, I was running an errand in Boulder. Decided to make a pit stop and go by the Ramsey house. First time seeing it in my life. As I mentioned, I lived in Colorado most of my life, as I am a native. At first I drove around it to the back alley. As I was driving in through the alley I started getting a very eerie feeling. I made my way to the front again, and finally took a picture. I then left to head back home. On my way back home, I started getting an aura. I had to pull over for a minute to shake it off. It lasted for about 15 seconds, and again, not too dramatic.

Weeks after that happened I think about that moment; as well at the time at Norma Jeane's crypt. Was it a coincidence that these aura's occurred during moments of visiting a cemetery, and a house where a murder took place? I can't explain it.

Conclusion:

I believe that in some way, Norma Jeane was guiding me, looking out for me. The coincidences and strange events - the dreams, the photographs, the subtle moments - felt like more than random occurrences. It was as though there was a force, a connection that went beyond logic, helping me navigate my life when I needed it most. Whether it was my faith, her presence, or something deeper at play, I can't deny that something beyond the ordinary was guiding me. Through the ups and downs, through moments of doubt and uncertainty, I've learned to trust the signs and listen to the whispers that come from the unseen. Maybe this was always the way it was meant to be. And in the end, I realize that all the pieces - every fleeting moment, every connection, every encounter - were leading me to this understanding. I am not alone. I am being watched over, guided, and protected by something greater than myself. Whatever it is, I'm listening, and I'm grateful for the connection that has given me the strength to move forward."
"What Was Walking?","Washington","Haunted Places","This story comes from my dad, who told me this when I was 12, I was highly interested in anything paranormal and although this probably pales in comparison to other stories on here, I think it's still interesting considering it happened after a funeral. 

 This takes place before I or my brother was born. Just to set the scene, it's an apartment on the bottom level with a side door that is the main entrance, but it has two floors. Anyway, my mom and dad were coming home from my grandpa's funeral, and as they were unlocking the door they heard a lot of footsteps from the second floor. My mom and dad looked at each other and quickly unlocked the door and ran in. They searched the whole place, 1st and 2nd floor found nothing. Nothing was disturbed. No one in the house. The only alive thing in the house at the time was the cat, and my dad says it distinctly sounded like footsteps. My mom, who's never really believed in ghosts, told me it was the cat knocking stuff over (though according to my dad nothing was touched or out of order) and my dad likes to entertain the idea it was my grandpa visiting them one last time.

 I personally like my dad's version, but I wasn't there and I technically got two versions of the story. My mom looked at the situation reasonably and with most logic, however because they were coming home from the funeral I like to believe my grandfather was doing a final walk-through. I'll probably never know, and frankly I don't even think my parents think much of it."
"Shadow Person Messing With My Wife","Idaho","Shadow People","Laying awake this morning around 2 am my alarm clock straight out in front of me. I am laying on my left side, and the dog is laying at my butt and knee area. The wife is behind me and my back is to her I had already talked to the wife between 12. 30 and 2 am this morning. When I wake early, I will quietly say I LOVE YOU so if she is awake, she is not alone and this morning she is awake and having a hard time getting back to sleep. So, I drift off and kind of off in bun bun land now when I hear my wife is making an odd noise while breathing in. She seems to be only getting half a breath and making odd noises in the middle of her breath.

Our bedroom is lit up somewhat and my clock says 2.53 am and as I listen to her breathing for maybe 20 seconds, I quickly snap my head her way to wake her only to see a shadow person quickly float down the side of her bed and disappear maybe out the window 3 ft from the end of the bed. I lay there wondering did I really just see that and I wait a few seconds, her breathing is now finally getting back to normal.

I now wake her and tell her how she was breathing, and she told me she was awake earlier after waking to a slight panic attack. Well, I told her when I went to wake her a shadow person floated away very quickly. This shadow was less than 6 ft tall and very dark and skinny.

One thing my wife told me within the last 3 weeks she said one morning, it feels like something has squeezed my heart it hurts like that. That statement is a little worrisome now. My wife wakes sometimes already having a panic attack and I had a well-known medium tell us there are no bad spirits here but that was over a couple year ago. I will be looking at our security camera when the wife gets up. It is infra-red so if it went out the window, maybe we might see it and I will let you know.

Of all the paranormal encounters we have had I don't like the thought of a shadow person around doing whatever they want to us. We thought we had seen some around our front door for a while there and I thought one was doing jumping jacks a few times trying to piss me off out of the corner of my eye, but it stopped. 

Any ideas on how to get rid of it or them? Thanks for reading."
"Old Farm House Experience","Illinois","Haunted Places","My ""10 Years Old and New House"" story reminds of some experiences I had going out to a friend's uncle's farm house. I don't remember how old the house might have been but it could have been built in the late 1930s-1940s, it was very nice old farm house, very well kept inside and out.

I first started visiting there when I was 12, my friend's aunt and uncle were extremely nice, easy going retired farm people. They very much lived on the main floor. What got me was the 'upstairs', I never saw or heard anything but it made me extremely uncomfortable. It was almost like walking into some type of electric field.

This was about 2 years after my ""10 Years Old and New House"" experience so I was somewhat sensitive to something there. My friend never felt anything but thought some of the old time pictures watched him. We camped out many times over the years but I never would have stayed the night in that house. My friend did tell me about an aunt with a very strict reputation that had passed away in one of the bedrooms upstairs. 

It was almost certainly something paranormal but I have no idea what it might have been. I have never, since then, felt anything stronger. After getting the $%^t scared out of me at age 10 or so, I may well have been blocking some of the things I might have otherwise noticed. By the time I was in my 20s, the effects, if they were still there didn't bother me much, if at all.

ETA: I actually tested the 'feeling' I got by walking up and down the stairway to the 2nd floor. I could tell when I encountered ""it"" and when I left the 'area' going back down stairs. I encountered this ""electric field"" a certain number of steps from the top floor. 

It was a feeling similar to being charged up from walking across a carpet in the winter time, except that it didn't go away when I stepped on the hard wood flooring. Whatever it was, it didn't vary any as I walked about the second story. 

I have read of other sensitives mentioning these types of feelings in actual haunts, eg.   (Sybil Leek working with Hans Holzer on a case in California.)  In my case IDK, it could have been residual.

Thanks,

Rob"
"The Whistle","North Carolina","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","One night I was putting my chickens away, locking them up so they would not get attacked. I was alone, waiting for my other sibling to get out there with a flashlight so we could look for eggs together. I was locking all the little doors on the coop when I heard a soft whistle to the left. This wasn't rare, since we have houses surrounding ours, but when I looked away from the direction where I had heard it, it whistled again. I again, just shrugged it off, thinking that it was someone just calling their dog home. But then the third time I looked away, it whooshed up to my ear, making it seem like someone was right there in my ear, whistling. I quickly spun my head to the left, where I had heard it, but there was nothing there. 

I glanced warily around, but couldn't see anything that could have done that. Finally, my sibling came out and we hurriedly checked for the eggs, and went back into the house. I told them and they just seemed creeped out, but also kind of joyful at my obvious discomfort. I don't really know if it was a boy trying to catch my attention and the wind caught it or what. We are surrounded by mountains so it could have just echoed, but I am not sure. It really could have been anything, but I was pretty creeped out in the moment. So... Maybe it was just an echo. It was coming from a kind of put off, creepy, rundown place though. Well, nothing else like that has happened to me since. I want to say it was around a year ago, maybe more, maybe less. Now, I tell this story as a form of enjoyment for my friends, but at the time, it was anything but that."
"""we Don't Need You.""","North Carolina","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","So, for the past couple months I have been hearing voices. But, it's not what you think. I am not schizophrenic, and I don't have hallucinations or anything like that. There are sounds in my family's voices. It'll just quickly start up, and after a moment of terrorizing me, it will end. The first couple of times this happened, it was softer, and there was only one. I'm going to tell you about this one time where it escalated. 

I was laying on my right side in bed a couple weeks ago going over the days events in my head. I was thinking about the next day, and what I would wear, do, and say. I thought about what my family had said that day, what they praised me on, criticized me on, and things like that. Suddenly I heard a voice whoosh up to my ear saying, "" We don't need you"". It was very sudden. Everything had been quiet, and then WHOOSH. A loud noise in my sibling's voice directly in my right ear, the one against the pillow. These things had happened before. But never like this. It got so loud, and so many other voices had joined in. I wanted to cover my ears and burrow down into my blankets, but I couldn't. And then, just, like that, it was over. The weirdest part about this is that, no matter how loud something gets, I can ALWAYS stand it. I can always put up with it. So when I had that sudden urge to cover my ears, it was very unexpected for me. I told my dad and he said that that happens to him too. We don't know what it is, but it hasn't happened again. At least to me, I'm not sure about my dad."
"The Knocks On The Wall","North Carolina","Haunted Places","I had been sleeping in my siblings' bedroom because we had been partying all night and were sharing childhood stories. There were 3 people there, including myself. We probably had went to bed around 1:00 and were exhausted.

 Suddenly, in the middle of the night, I woke up. I couldn't go back to sleep so I grabbed my phone and started scrolling through Instagram. A couple of minutes later, the sibling who was sleeping on my left side also woke up. She saw me on my phone so she grabbed hers. (It's the middle of the night, we weren't supposed to be on them. 😂) After a couple minutes of whispering and playing games, we heard a noise. It sounded like a bang, on the wall directly in front of me. I couldn't see anything because of the glare of my phone, so my sibling and I just froze. 

Suddenly, it was moving down the wall, towards my left side. BANG, BANG, BANG, BANG. It sounded like picture frames were flying off the walls, landing on the hardwood floors. But, we didn't have any pictures hung up. We didn't have hardwood, just carpet. My sibling and I were too scared to see what it was, so we ducked under the blanket and eventually fell asleep. In the morning, there was nothing there. Everything was in its right place, and there was nothing on the floor. We talked about it with my other sibling who was asleep throughout the whole thing. We thought one of my other family members had something to do with it, but we asked, and they didn't. We told my dad and he just shrugged, saying it was probably some pipe or something. To this day, we don't know what it was."
"My Sleep Paralysis Episode","North Carolina","Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis","I was sleeping in my bedroom on my back, and the room was bright white. I could only see the blanket that was on top of me, which was a pink comforter with white outlines of flowers on it. There was a slight black outline of a figure standing at the end of my bed. He asked me a question, "" Do you want your family to die?"" My eyes were wide and I was struggling to breathe. But I couldn't get myself to move or say anything. 

He gave me 7 seconds to answer, and then he would choose for me. I screamed at myself to get up and tell him, "" No! I don't want them to die! Don't!"" But I still could not move. The seconds ticked by, until he was at the door, turning the doorknob, at 6. Right before he opened the door, I leapt up in bed and shrieked, "" No!"" and it ended. What was even more startling, was that I could hear my siblings outside my door, running around, screaming with delight. 

I was more scared than I had ever been in my whole life. I was so afraid. I think this was a sleep paralysis episode, but I've never had it confirmed, so I'm not sure. It's hard to describe how scared I was, terrified, panicked, petrified. I've never had another episode like this, but I've had dreams. During this episode, I had been having nightmares for months. I would see dead girls, dead family, or something would just be... Off. I was never sure what it was though. And none of my dreams were happy. There might not have been any danger on the surface, but it was there. The clouds were covering the skies, the sun was never out, or it would be raining. I've told my family, and they were disturbed, but, luckily, I've never had another one."
"The Nightmare That Only Gets Worse","Arizona","A Haunted Life","I feel like I need to start this off with a warning that this story does contain explicit content, and I share it hoping that it helps me maybe identify what is afflicting me through the help of anyone else that has experienced something similar, so I can then get rid of it, and then hopefully if someone else is in a similar position they can read this.

Let me start this story by back tracking a couple of years, I was living in Flagstaff, Arizona I was 28 years old and living with my sister, and we had an upstairs neighbor that was violent and strange. I was and I am convinced she was possessed. She spit on me, and would absolutely flip out in the middle of the night, sounding like she was about to break through the floor, my sister had her arrested about a year before I moved in for trying to throw her down the stairs. This violence was definitely weird as we were both nice, quiet kind people.

 Shortly after moving in, I suddenly for the first time in my life started having seizures, which caused me to break both my foot and later ankle from seizures, and have required two surgeries with a third pending. I only bring this up because it's the start of a series of very strange, and unfortunate events, but anyways, due to the surgeries and seizures and the fact I have a history of opioid addiction, they wouldn't even prescribe pain medication after surgery which I understand, but the first surgery was just too much for my newly found sobriety and I ended up falling back into an opioid addiction, fentanyl to be exact. The what I found out later was seizures that started out of nowhere were getting bad, and at the same time I started noticing a dark presence was constantly around me. 

One night while in Flagstaff, I was about to jump into the shower and my bathroom door came flying open and hitting me in the back while I was standing in front of it, I thought it was my sister and I discovered she was at work at the hospital where she worked as an overnight nurse. I was very active in my addiction and immediately after I had surgery I went to a rehab, got out relapsed again, and my sister basically disowned me due to my relapse, and she still refuses to talk to me as I write this, but by the end of 2022 I got help and have stayed clean and sober from Nov. 2022 until present day, which I as of writing this am a 32 year old male, I do have a girlfriend, and I do maintain a pretty decent job managing a small team at a car dealership. I've never had hallucinations, or suffered psychosis of any real sort, but I feel like I am going insane at times, but I know I'm not. 

So basically this is the part where things start to get worse for me, as I said I was diagnosed with epilepsy after having probably 100 seizures in a 1.5 year period with multiple hospital stays, and this past July 28th,2024, I was in a car accident that landed me in the ICU at the trauma hospital with two fractured vertebrae.

 I was terrified, and alone. I found out I wasn't going to need surgery but still was out of work for over a month and was extremely depressed.

 About two weeks after I get back to work I was laying in bed one night around the first week of October and I noticed what looked like a faint shadow pacing around my bed quickly, and it scared me so bad I didn't sleep in my apartment for a month, then while in my car it felt like there was something grabbing at my feet and legs.

I started capturing videos of just weird out of place stuff moving. I noticed that there was a faint sound of a super high pitched noise like what you hear when a tv is on, and strange voices of a female. I eventually worked up the courage to sleep in my house again and I started to notice there were more of these shadow entities, and they would cause me to feel pain in my genitalia, and anal region which is so embarrassing to admit. I am constantly being touched and this thing follows me EVERYWHERE, even to work... I also started hearing really faint, ominous, dreadful sounds like horns of sort. I also would notice sometimes it seemed like there was something that had more power than the other entities and didn't look like a faint shadow. It looked like the same effect of like a mirage in the desert, just in the shape of a human like being. I've noticed the shadows jump if I throw exorcism water at it, and if I hold my rosary out towards it that my rosary will spin and my crucifix necklace gets pulled so tightly.

 The noises started with the frequent sound of a single whistle here and there, and I also hear that high pitched noise constantly, and other strange noises that I can only describe as electronic noises, and even hear what I can only equate to what I would assume a portal sounds like sucking something through, and then something or someone was yelling ""Hey!"" at me in a strangely normal human voice for about 2 seconds before hearing that noise again and sounding like it was sucked out through the ""portal noise.""

 I have video of some stuff if anyone is curious. Anyways, I recently just moved and things seem almost worse, and I'm working with the church who is putting me in touch with an exorcist. I just don't feel possessed but this thing definitely has an obsession with my male reproductive organs and anal region, so I'm constantly on guard. I recently just moved, and the church is so slow, I do online deliverance prayers, but nothing is working. 

Has anyone ever experienced anything like this? It's been an absolute nightmare and could seriously use help. I'll also add that due to my history with addiction I do see a psychiatric doctor for depression, but she even told me I don't suffer from psychosis and should contact a priest. So please if you have experienced anything like this, please let me know."
"The Ghosts Of The Winding Staircase","Ohio","Haunted Places","Last fall, two of my friends (I will not disclose the real names, but I will call Andrea, and Matthew to protect their identity) decided to do something that ended up changing all our lives completely. We three decided to take a trip to a small town named Port Washington, it's in Ohio and it has been known to be affiliated with organizations like the KKK and a lot of sacrilegious things happened there. 

There have been claims of people seeing other people doing witchcraft, active KKK members, and even animal sacrifices where the animals are known to have their heads put at the top of the Winding Staircase and their bodies at the bottom. Police have been called there more times than not, but when they get there it seems like those claims all of a sudden dissipate, like the police don't even want to be involved in the history of that road. 

So when the day came that we decided to take a trip to the Winding Staircase little did we know that this experience would be most likely the worst experience that we have ever had to endure for quite some time now. 

It was about 4:00 p.m. When we got there and of course night was slowly catching up, the thing about the winding staircase is nobody knows the true history behind it; why it was built, why people keep having these very tormenting experiences, but still it is open to the public.

 When we got to the bottom of the hill we realized that there was only one way up and one way down that if there was a car coming down while we were going up we were screwed! Along the edges of the road was complete rocky drop offs, that we knew if we fell we would immediately be falling to our deaths, and nobody would be coming to save us for quite some time.

 Yet we still went on, as we wound up the road it started to feel like the walls in the car were starting to condense, close in, like we were suffocating. It felt like we were not supposed to be there. About the middle of the drive up we started to notice little things here and there, headaches, nausea. I felt the need to sob, I felt vulnerable. My friend Matthew was starting to get overly agitated and paranoid, like somebody was coming after him and he wanted to get out of there now. Andrea just kept driving but her face was stoic, expressionless, like the past conversation that we had leading up to this point didn't even matter, like she forgotten the whole thing, it went from ""so as I was saying"" to complete silence. But this silence wasn't the silence I'd be worried about just yet, she just kept her eyes in front of her.

 Once we got to the top of the hill we decided to stop and get out. The only way we're able to actually reach the very top of the hill was to take the abandoned walkway that was closed off from the public. We knew if we got caught, we would be in some deep deep trouble. As we began walking up we started feeling like other people were walking with us, it felt like we weren't alone. Eventually the sun left us and we were deep within the woods, and the darkness that came with it, following a path that could potentially lead to devastation, or something really extravagant. 

We wanted to know if the stories that I heard, that we all heard growing up were true. As we tracked deeper and deeper into the woods it was like the birds were silent. It was nothing except the cracking of leaves and sticks, and our breathing as we were quite frankly possibly scaring ourselves. I was worried about this silence. I knew from my very few survival skills that if it was completely silent where you're standing, then to get out of there. But at the same time I couldn't help but to think, why aren't the birds chirping? It was dead silence. 

Andrea was starting to freak herself out more and more as we finally reached the top of the hill that took almost an entire hour. And then she saw it, her eyes went wide as they raked the surrounding area until we saw what she was staring at. Hanging up in the dense trees that surrounded us were what looked to be white hoods nailed into the trees surrounding a circle, we didn't know what was in the circle until we turned our flashlight on it, and what we saw completely scared the shiat out of us. It looked to be a almost perfectly circular pit, I guess a fire pit of sorts but it looked to be years upon years of just ashes, soot, wood, and God knows what else piled into what look to be a 6 inch by 3 ft pit. And those white hoods that were surrounded those trees were none other than the KKK hoods. The air felt mean, evil, and stagnant as we decided at that point that we were not going to stay and we are going to hightail our asses out of there. 

It took us an hour to get up this hill and of course it took us an hour to get down the hill but this time a little bit quicker because Matthew was about 5 ft in front of me running down, Andrea was about 10 feet in front of us. More and more we felt like the eyes were etched upon our souls looking into our deepest darkest thoughts and secrets that we knew we couldn't even hide anymore, felt like anything and everything that we knew about ourselves was gone, little did I know that Matthew had the urge to literally run right off of the cliffs that surrounded this winding staircase, and did I know that Andrea was just going to strand us there? No. She got to the car before us and before we could even say wait, she drove out of there.

 It was just me and Matthew left, scared, frightened and literally about to pee my pants, we decided to walk the rest of the way down the staircase to conserve energy. Every twist and turn left us more and more in fear. By this time, I felt my legs were about to give out for how much we have been running and it felt like we have been running forever. And it still felt like there was no way out, time felt slower, kind of like when you run in your dreams you can't run. It feels like you're running through slow motion, adrenaline pumping we kept kicking ourselves to get ourselves down this hill walking faster and faster out of here. Complete silence surrounded us once again and the only thing we could hear this time was our footsteps and our labored breathing. Getting that feeling that whatever it was, was catching up, we try to run faster than what we think is running behind us, but the thing is nothing was running behind us. So what were we running from? 

I've seen some pretty scary stuff in my lifetime and I knew that the KKK had nothing against a ghost because they're real. This wasn't. Or if it was, we couldn't see, but feel it. But I understood Matthew's standpoint because Matthew was black and Matthew did not want to be caught up in this to begin with. Andrea had a pretty messed up history about her grandparents being a part of this land and she also did not want to be a part of that. So that just leads to me, I wanted to be a ghost hunter that goes around putting myself in situations that leads to this one, but putting my friends in danger just to see if my childhood stories are true? I felt disgusting, and being caught up in these thoughts I did not realize that Matthew had stopped and as I was running I almost ran into him completely in the dark. 

He told me to look down the pathway and we could see the outskirt edge of the end of the road but there was something blocking it. At first we thought it was Andrea's car, that Andrea was going to be coming after us after all, and this was all just going to be a funny thing by the next morning. But all hope failed as we realized that this object about 20 ft in front of us was not a car, but a black hazy figure that was low to the ground, like it was Army crawling towards us, and of course Matthew did not know what to do, and he decided to start running back up the hill as I was frozen in place. 

I witnessed this black hazy figure grow bigger and bigger in front of me, kind of like when you're staring off in the road in the middle of summer and you see the heat waves coming off of the pavement? That was all around that figure like it was pulsating, and all I felt was dread, like everything leading up to this point was meaningless, I felt nothing, like it was sucking every bit of happiness out of my soul, out of my eyes, out of my skin. 

It was at this point we saw headlights pulling up from the end of the road and as I saw the black figure more and more it looked to be like some type of deer, but it wasn't a deer, I grew up in the country, we went hunting, and I knew what deer looked like. My next thought was a bear but then I realized it was way too thin to be a bear, way too low to the ground.

 As Matthew came barreling down the hill again, yelling ""I see lights! I see lights!"", he also saw the black figure as it dashed across the side of the road down to the edge of the cliff next to the road. Matthew thought that it was a person running towards the edge of the cliff as Andrea was coming out of the car. 

Andrea was freaking out because she saw the figure too, joined Matthew and I at the edge of this cliff as we peered down. Our phones were not bright enough with the flashlight to be able to see the bottom of the cliff, but it left a hazy mist in its path, and you could see the haze as it went down off of this cliff; light gray, smokey and the dread still lingered in the air. We knew that if it was a person messing around with us we would have had to call 911 because they would have been dead, but the more we look down the more we realize that nothing was there at all. Just rocks and whatever else is piled down on that cliff. 

Freaked out we went home and the next day I tried to talk with both of them about it. It was like they didn't want to even remember what we went through, that what we thought was supposed to be a fun little trip to see if the Clan is still there turned out to be a nightmare. To this day even though this was 3 months ago, I still have nightmares about it, a deep, long winding road completely silent and jet black as I walk up it, growls harrowing through my thoughts as I wake up drenched in sweat every time. 

I wouldn't say that road tore our friendship apart, but it's eerie because not even 2 days after that we went our separate ways. We were friends for a long time since 9th grade and it took a road to break us up. I don't expect people to believe me with what we saw and what we went through. It seems too exaggerated for it to be true, but if you look up Port Washington, or even Tuscarawas County in general, you will see that we are a desolate County, filled with tears, pain and bloodshed that goes way back. 

I found out after digging into Port Washington and the Winding Staircase, that other people have the exact same claims that we had; seeing hazy animals that would just dive off of cliffs or dive onto cars only for there to be nothing but footprints left behind. And even people who go up to just party, have been rushed out by what we would think is the police, but it's actually whatever force is left up there. Whatever pain and suffering that winding road has seen. It definitely has an effect on anybody that decides to explore there. So I am warning you, do not go to the Winding Staircase, there are active members still etched into the trees. And the anguish that went along with our dark part of history."
"Return Of The Dead","Alabama","Pets / Animals","I have no idea if it's his spirit or ghost, but every night, 2:15 am exactly, I wake up to my long dead dog, Charlie, standing in the doorway of my bedroom. His decayed body standing in the doorway, one eye staring at me as the other hangs out of his half exposed skull. Decayed, bloody, and the smell, oh the smell, stronger than an elephant's trunk. Then, he runs and jumps on my bed, getting right in front of my face, panting, I gag every time.

 It isn't normal, seeing him, hearing his paws around the house, occasional barks, whimpers, my parents are convinced I'm crazy, but I see him, hear him. I don't know whether I'm hallucinating or actually seeing it anymore. 

The timing is impeccable every single time, decaying more and more each time. I've been researching these encounters, nothing so far. Every night, 2:15 am, at my bedroom doorway, staring at me for exactly 3 minutes and 48. 94 seconds (I timed it 10 times), before finally moving onto my bed, staring more for 7.37 seconds EXACTLY, before biting my neck, and then disappearing.

 At this point, my heart rate is at exactly 137 BMP exactly. This is where I pass out. I have no idea why this happens, but it happens every night, exact time, exact amount of time, everything.

 When he was alive, he was always so sweet. What changed exactly? He got oral cancer and we had to put him down and then buried him next to the back porch on our house. Maybe he's angry he was put down, but why would he come for me? Shouldn't he go for my father? My mother? I had nothing to do with the decision of putting him down, I was as nice as I could be to him."
"The Bingham Light Continued Pt 2","South Carolina","Orbs / Lights / Mists","Hey guys!

I will be taking you back to my ""Bingham Light"" encounters. To give a bit of backstory on the history of this ""ghost light"" and my very first encounter with it, you can check one of my past stories titled ""The Bingham Light"". 

The Bingham Light is something that I've been going to see on an irregular basis over the past 14 years being as I live not too far from the location (within 25 minutes away). My first encounter was back in 2010. I have since been out to the sight over 80 times, but so far I've only actually seen the light maybe 7 or 8 times out of all of those visits - including recently. 

Within the past 2 1/2 weeks I have been going out to the site and (very surprisingly) I saw the light on each occasion - which makes 3 times, not counting my past sightings.

As I just alluded to, sightings of this light are very rare, but what I've come to notice over the years is that it seems to be more active during the cold winter months. I can not say that this will guarantee any sightings for anyone else who may want to see it around this time, but that's just a pattern I've come to notice. Maybe there is some correlation with this spirit? Perhaps that is when the incident happened that caused the person's death? Or maybe it's something else.

Anyway, to get on with this... There really isn't much of a story or anything significant. I am just simply reporting recent sightings.

So the first time was on December 15th. My younger sister and I decided to go out to the site after we had just got back into town for a night out at the mall and doing other things. However, we didn't see the light on this visit.

The following weekend (December 21st I believe) we went out to the site again. I had just come back into town from an outing and decided to pick her up and take her out there being as there was nothing else going on, and it being rather late.

We didn't have any intentions on seeing the light this time. In fact, after the few times I've taken her out to the location she kind of gave up hope on seeing it because it would never appear during those times. We parked in front of the huge corn field on S. Butler Rd (the main location where the light is often seen) and we just chatted for a while, mostly about paranormal stuff that we've experienced in the past. After a while we finally called out to the light a few times (yelling ""Bingham Light, come out!"") but like before, it never appeared.

A little later I saw an illumination off in the distance behind us. This was no Bingham Light this time, this was a car coming down the dirt road. It was still a good distance away and only the trees were illuminated faintly from the light. Not knowing who it was or if it were one of the rangers that occasionally patrols the area, I yelled to my sister ""Let's get outta here!"". We ran back to the car then left quickly! 

As we were nearing the end of the dirt road we saw the car behind us, still off in the distance. Not really worried about it any longer as we were far enough ahead of them, I decided to take a left onto the main road (Hwy 34) and go down to the other side at Reedy Springs Ct (another dirt road in the area about a mile or so away).

We parked and I shut all the lights off, then proceeded to call out to the light several times from the windows while we chatted a bit. As a side note, the whole area in itself is creepy without any lights, but Reedy Springs Ct is INCREDIBLY creepy, even more so than over at the S. Butler Rd side in front of the field. I guess because the area over at Reedy Springs Ct is more enclosed by woods and you never know which direction that light is going to come from!

After a while something suddenly caught my eye from the left, startling me. I saw a light slowly gliding through the woods about 10-15 yards ahead. I at first thought it was someone coming out of the woods shining a small flash light so I was about to peel out of there but I stopped. All the while I was yelling to my sister to ""LOOK!"" ""DID YOU SEE THAT?!"". 

The light was bright and appeared to be a white or light blue color but it didn't shine or illuminate anything around it. It looked as if one of the stars from the sky was hovering a few feet above the ground, and it was gliding at a steady pace. That was the exact appearance.

We watched in awe as the light came out of the woods, but what was weird was that the light disappeared immediately when it got onto the edge of the dirt road, then it immediately appeared directly on the opposite side of the road at the edge of the woods! That part definitely freaked us out! It seemed to just entered the woods and then disappeared, at least for a few moments.

I tried to reason for a moment that maybe it was a firefly, but given the behavior of this light it definitely was not a firefly, and I've seen plenty of those out in that area in the warm months.

We were filled with excitement, and especially my sister as this was her first time finally seeing the light! The light continued to flash in the woods on the right side of the road at various times after that, but this time the light was more ""muted"" and showed in flashes like it usually did when I seen it before. When it first appeared moments before it wasn't flashing. It was just a steady glow and it was brighter.

My sister called out to the light to ""COME HERE!"" and after a few minutes it flashed just a few yards from the car on her side! We stayed out there for a bit after that. I even called my older sister and we were reporting what we were seeing. After a while we finally left, satisfied that we seen the light!

On my next visit a week ago I went out to the site again, but this time I was alone. I didn't go over the the field side on this visit being as the dirt roads were still a bit wet from a previous rain. S. Butler Rd has the tendency to bog you down or even slide you off on either side of the road into the deep trenches, but the dirt road on Reedy Springs Ct isn't near as bad.

I parked, shut the lights out, then made the call. After just a few minutes I saw faint flashes to my left in the woods not too far from the car, so I left quickly.

The last time I saw it was just last night. I had just come from a club in North Carolina and it was after 3 going on 4 am. I wasn't quite ready to go home yet so I told myself I would head out that way to kill a little time.

I first drove down to S. Butler Rd to go to the field. At the time I was doing a video documenting the experience live, but the video got cut short due to a malfunction. ""No worries"" I said. 

I didn't bother making the call to the light over at the field side, nor did I see anything, so I drove over to the Reedy Springs Ct side. 

After I parked I shut off all the lights and opened my sunroof and made the call to the light about 3 times. It wasn't long after that when I saw a light suddenly appear from the edge of the woods on the right side of the road about 20 yards ahead of me, then the light came out into the road. This time the light appeared bright like it did the time before last when I saw it with my sister. When I saw that I immediately clicked on my headlights and the light was instantly gone - just like that. I decided to leave being as I was alone and not knowing if that light was going to come up on me! Nonetheless, the experience was exhilarating! 

So this has been my recent experiences involving this ""ghost light"". It continues to be something that fascinates me now as much as it did when I very first saw it! No one knows for sure what it is, although it does have a legend behind it. There is no doubt however, that the light is definitely something paranormal, and interesting all the same."
"Always Close Your Portals Kids","Kentucky","Haunted Places","The story I am about to share is not one event but a collection of ongoings in the townhouse I shared with my friend as well as our connection to the paranormal. 

It was the October of 2016 in northern Kentucky. I had a falling out with my previous best friend whom I shared the townhouse with and suddenly had to fill the vacancy to be able to afford the rental unit. This resulted in my newly acquainted friend from work taking over the other half of the lease. 

I didn't know Cooper long but I had no other options and we seemed to get a long well. I went to his grandmother's house to help him pick up his things for the move. The house felt cold and strange - the atmosphere feeling off. Her dining room was covered in angel dolls from wall to wall. Downstairs where Cooper stayed there was an impressive crystal ball on a table covered in copious amounts of crystals.

His grandmother was a physic previously. She talked of shadow people and the other world as if they were her neighbor.

She offered to read my palm and reluctantly I gave it to her. I was a practicing pagan and believed in the paranormal but was skeptic of most things too. She mentioned details of my life she had no way of knowing nor did Cooper. 

I was a bit spooked but we left shortly after.

We invited a few friends over to help with the move and hang out. In Cooper's bedroom (which I never entered when my previous roommate was there) I felt this draw to the closet- I kept retreating from our laughing friend group and sitting in there. 

They hadn't noticed for a bit and everyone went outside to retrieve more boxes. I turned the light off in the closet and sat in there with the door shut. It felt safe and soothing. 

Embarrassed to admit I'm sort of afraid if the dark and small places so this was out of character.

When my friends came back upstairs they took noticed and convinced me to leave the closet to get dinner.

The following week Cooper admitted to having a nightmare almost nightly where there was this dark figure in his closet with a huge toothy grin staring at him. 

Now here comes Halloween. 

As a practicing pagan I felt compelled to do some spell work in honor of Samhain. I did this spell that was more of a thanks/ love to ancestors and passed loved ones. Well I believe something went wrong and I opened up a portal.

Things started kicking off in the house quickly after. 

Starting that night - we went to a Halloween party and returned to the house late - I was drunk of course. 

I went to use the downstairs bathroom and I don't recall all the details myself cause I was drunk but my friend was not - evidently I was saying Bloody Mary in the mirror and talking to someone in the corner who I described as a woman in a grey dress. 

When I was taking awhile and Cooper could hear me talking to someone he tried to open the door that doesn't lock - but it was stuck. 

Finally after getting it open he found me still talking to someone unseen in the corner in the complete dark.

Shortly after we both came home from work at the same time to discover my goddess pendant that hung around my bedroom door knob for protection was cut clean off as if with a knife. 

The same week -

Cooper thought I was home when I wasn't on a few occasions as he saw a woman with dark long hair move from the bathroom to my bedroom. 

Almost daily -

I often felt like someone was right behind me in the kitchen walking with my every step. 

Then after that,

We came upstairs once to see his door partially open - I saw a white head with glowing eyes drop down from his ceiling. 

By the drained color of his face he saw it too. We noped out if there and went to stay elsewhere that night. 

The final event before we aggressively tried to leave was one night we were in the living room. 

Cooper's dog was acting strange and ran upstairs. Cooper went to check on him but was taking awhile so I came up. 

The door to his room was barricaded - I struggled to get in. Cooper's dog bolted out spooked.

Cooper sat in the middle of his room in a daze, mumbling. 

I didn't understand what was going on but was trying to get him to snap out of it. 

Cooper suddenly looked behind me with fearful eyes and told me I had to go - leave now. Behind me was the closet. Trying to rationalize that he's being ridiculous I went to drag him up and he reluctantly started to come. I felt a pain on my arm but ignored it - I still tried to convince myself this was all in my head. I grabbed his arm and started walking out of the room convinced he'd be fine after we left. It felt like multiple people were pulling us back as I walked - it was difficult. We got out of the room and yanked the door shut. As we start to head down the stairs he starts to gain more awareness and is confused. I look down to see 3 red scratch marks on my arm. 

After we left the house we didn't have nearly as much paranormal encounters which I was thankful for."
"At Wind Cave","South Dakota","Haunted Places","It was shortly after the 4th of July holiday that I had begun a summer road trip. My aim was to see as many of our western National Parks as could be squeezed into a two month leave of absence from work.

 My travel vehicle of choice would be a new Ford Transit. Having purchased a little silver one, these odd boxy vans looked quite a bit like your typical neighborhood postal delivery truck, but I imagined it to be more like my NASA silver bullet capsule for a solo journey deep into the American west!

 From Wisconsin, my first ""landing"" was the moon-like landscape of Badlands National Park located in southwest South Dakota. After an incredible day of hiking through miles of the unusual sandstone formations, and with the sun setting over the big skies of the surrounding prairie, I had discovered a free camping area in the adjoining National Grasslands. Located at the far end of The Badlands main drive, and navigating a dusty gravel road to the somewhat remote camp area, I found myself being held-up by a large male bison that seemed most comfortable standing right in the middle of the road. Nearly as big as my little van and with horns far more impressive than the honk of the Transit, I granted the bull his time and space. 

 Once at the rough camp area, and while I had slept in the van the night before at a South Dakota wayside, on this night, I'd decided to pitch my small tent and crawled into my sleeping bag. At least a dozen or more colorful tents had dotted the central grass area with some horse trailers and corralled horses spending the night off to the side of the main loop. With an old-west mix of sage and horse in the cool evening air, I was feeling a bit like a real cowboy and soon slipped off into Dakota dreamland.

 Sometime, in the early morning hours, I was suddenly awoken by the heavy thumping on the ground accompanied by some bizarre grunt-like sounds. Unzipping the tent door flap to investigate, it was as if my mind couldn't believe what I was seeing! A large black eye was looking directly back at me from only a few feet away! Surrounding the big black eye were tufts of dark brown hair and then the whole head and horns of another huge bull bison. His head passed by my tent door as his lumbering steps were punctuated by labored grunts as if complaining about the exertion required to move such a mammoth body. The trimmer size of his backend passed by me with his tail swathing back and forth nearly slapped me in the chops! No sooner had he passed when to my disbelief, I saw an entire herd of bison big and small making their way through the fragile nylon tents. Some of the bison were so close that I could hear them sucking and then expelling air from their saliva dripping black mouths and nostrils. It was incredible! This was the real American West that I had never dreamt could still exist- and here I was right in the middle of it -cowpies and all!

 After the last of the herd had passed through the camp area, I hurried behind to see them all disappear over the hillside and then down into a deeper ravine. Spotting a park ranger perched on a horse coral fence, I made my way over to ask him if any of the tents had gotten trampled. Obviously well-experienced and cool-headed, this older ranger just smiled and rather passively said, ""none far as I can see."" I then asked him how often such an event had happened. ""'Bout every morning,"" he replied taking a sip of steaming coffee from his beat-up Thermos. In disbelief I asked if the bison had ever trampled any tents or campers and he replied, ""Not so far... They just winna git to the creek for their morning' water."" He tossed away some undrunk coffee from the Thermos cup and then stepped down from his observation point on the fence. As we walked toward his park service pick-up, he further explained that after spending the night up in the ""grassy stuff,"" the herd would seasonally pass through the camp area on their way to the water. As he talked it was crossing my mind how this guy could easily give Hollywood's Sam Elliott a run for his money!

 Later that day, after hiking a few more trails in The Badlands, I moved on to explore the Black Hills of Custer State Park. Wildlife was abundant as I drove leisurely through the park loops of dark rock, fragrant pines and picturesque green pastures. My drive culminated with a pass through several short and narrow rock tunnels in an area known as ""The Needles"". The name was given to this higher mountainous area because of its many tall rock spires. 

 Just below The Needles area, I hiked through a beautiful meadow filled with colorful wildflowers, butterflies and peacefully buzzing honeybees. Later as the temperatures rose into the eighties, I took a swim in cool Lake Sylvan which is surrounded by monumental looking smooth rock walls. On the advice of locals, I saved Mount Rushmore for the evening with its inspirational sunset memorial ceremony. After the hot July sun had dropped behind the pine covered Black Hills, and as the giant sculpture of the four presidents had just begun to fade into the darkness, a switch is thrown and, along with our national anthem, the president's white granite faces were bathed again in glowing white light. It's hard not to feel a stir of real patriotism while visiting Mount Rushmore. 

 On my next and final night in the Black Hills, I'd slowly made my way through Custer State Park's scenic wildlife loop to a small campground located near the Wind Cave Visitors Center. Wind Cave became our eighth national park in 1903 and though I'd never heard of it prior to my arrival in the Black Hills, I'd learned that the cave was one of the largest in the world with over 143 miles of underground passageways and chambers. In a Park Service publication, I'd noticed an illustration of the cave and was amazed by its complexity! It was not simply a long underground tunnel, but rather an elaborate multi-level gridwork of interconnecting passages and rooms.

 At the peaceful prairie campground, I'd made something to eat on my small cook stove as campfires had been temporarily banned due to the hot and dry weather. Crawling into my sleeping bag after washing dinner dishes, the skies had dimmed, and the squirrels and birds had begun to quiet for the night. I remember a certain unease as I lay falling asleep contemplating all of those miles of hollow passageways running just beneath the same ground on which I now slept. Those thoughts, and the softness of the waning sunlight were abruptly interrupted by a noisy convoy of white trucks as they suddenly roared past my campsite and parked in a large open grass area. 

 As soon as the convoy had come to a halt, clunking doors flew open and a dozen or so boisterous, sweaty and charcoal stained athletic young fire fighters all piled-out. Apparently just back from fighting some forest fire, like clockwork they quickly popped-up tents, showered and ate -all while maintaining steady and cheerful banter. Then, just as suddenly as all had appeared and exactly at 10:00 p.m., all fell silent again as they seemed to have hit the sack with military-like precision. With calm restored, only the occasional rattle of coons that had found some empty cans could yet be heard as a moon rose yet higher over the Black Hills.

 I'd awoken early the next morning to the noisy chatter of the fire fighters all up just after sunrise for breakfast. Their pace seemed to have an urgency and soon all were off to whatever forest fire required their skills. After my own breakfast, I made my way over to the Wind Cave Visitors Center to purchase my ticket for the morning's first tour. 

 The entrance for the cave tour was outdoors and to one side of the Visitors Center. There's a long ravine that leads to a small block building and that is where I found a couple dozen other ticket holders beginning to form a line. Since I was alone and most of the others appeared to be excited and chatty family groups, I'd decided to hang-back at the end of the line.

 After a few moments as I was simply enjoying the morning sun and eaves dropping on the banter between children and their parents in the line ahead, suddenly and with no warning whatsoever, I was struck by a wall of intense sickness! Overwhelming nausea was accompanied by a panicked realization that despite my efforts to breathe, I was coming up very short of air. At the same time, while trying to focus on breathing so as not to pass-out, my thoughts were invaded by some knowing that we were all going die in the cave. None of it made any sense, but there was no time to do anything other than to focus on my breathing. I was not getting enough oxygen and taking deeper breaths wasn't helping! I knew I should tell someone about what was happening, but where would I get the air, and I was pretty sure I'd vomit if I broke any of my concentration on simply taking regular breaths. Also preventing me from asking for help was the thought of how disruptive and embarrassing the entire rescue squad thing would likely be. 

 As my ability to get air seemed to ease a bit, I then noticed that the park ranger had arrived and was unlocking the door on the small block building to the cave. Just then, a woman about halfway up in the line, was heard hollering to the ranger that her husband was not feeling well and may need assistance. My first thought was that a poisonous gas must be emanating from the cave! ""We must all be getting gassed,"" I thought to myself. The park ranger quickly yelled back to the woman saying, ""Have him come up here and stand by me -if he's not feeling better, we'll get him out of here."" It made no sense, I thought. Why would anyone want to get closer to the cave if we were all getting gassed? Then I realized that I was at the back of the line and farthest from the cave entrance- if anything, the closest people would be getting sick first! It must not be a poisonous gas I'd concluded, but then thought, should I go up and stand by the ranger too? How could this possibly help?

 After just a couple more minutes had passed, my symptoms seemed to be easing. The dark thoughts lifted and suddenly I broke-free and into a refreshing and welcome cold sweat. It was over, I thought. Thank God! The refreshing cool air of the morning and welcome rays of the morning sun swept in. Glancing up and wondering if anyone had noticed my peril, I saw the other afflicted man and his wife making their way back to their place in-line. He must have also been feeling better- how strange I thought! I quickly raced through my limited knowledge of medical conditions and their related symptoms trying to guess what might have just happened. I'd had no known health issues and had had a good night's rest. I'd been feeling calm and fine all morning until I 'd been struck by the sudden and severe sickness -and why the dark thought that we would all die in the cave? I'd been in other caves in the past and had felt no particular anxiety about going on this tour. Should I still go on the tour? What if the sickness were to be returned when I was deep down in some cave passage?...what a nightmare that could end-up being! I assured myself that the Visitors Center would likely have no issue exchanging my ticket for a later tour and that that would be the safest and most prudent choice to make. As all these thoughts were running through my head, the Park Ranger began addressing the crowd and welcoming us all to Wind Cave. We were asked to have our tickets ready for collection at the entry door. The line began moving forward and I found myself moving with it.

 This wasn't the first time I was taking an unwarranted risk or found my body moving when my head reasoned otherwise. I remembered a time back in college when two buddies and I had decided to sign-up for a parachute jump. Despite spending the entire morning training, when the plane engine was cut thousands of feet above the ground and as I was climbing out through the plane's open side door -out and onto a simple pipe welded to the bottom of the plane- with nothing to hold onto besides the wing strut, I had also found my body moving while my head kept telling me to stop! Just like that time, I was now moving toward the big cave doors while my mind only saw the logic in simply waiting for a later tour! ""Ticket please,"" came the request from the ranger's assistant standing at the entry.

 Snaking our way down and into the cool dampness of a dimly lit passageway, I again smelled that unique odor common to caves and my grandmothers ""root cellar"" basement. As the passageway soon led to the first chamber, and at each chamber thereafter, the park ranger would stop and provide the group with some time to marvel at the illuminated and usual rock formations. Most of the grey and tan colored sandstone appeared to be dripping or melting from the ceiling and forming piles of solidified goop on the cave floor. Before moving-on from each chamber to another passageway, the ranger would provide us with another digestible chunk of cave geology, terminology and tales of the cave's discovery and history until becoming a National Park.

 Early in the tour, the ranger told of how two boys back in 1881 had been out rabbit hunting when suddenly one of the boy's hats had been blown off by cool air rushing from a hole in the ground. Intrigued by this phenomenon, the two boys returned the next day with shovels, ropes and candles. Once lowered into a hole they had dug, the boys discovered the incredible natural wonder that had been hidden below ground for thousands and thousands of years.

 The ranger went on to describe how Native American tribes in the area had known of the hole itself but considering it to be a spiritual place that had given rise to the buffalo. For this reason, tribes in the area had never entered the small opening. For several years after the discovery, only locals had frequented the new cave. Eventually, with the financial success that the railroads were having in bringing tourists to nearby Hot Springs, South Dakota, it was speculated that the new cave could bring-in additional ticket and lodging revenue. A house and small hotel were built, and two families began providing tourists with basic accommodations tours of Wind Cave.

 For young Alvin McDonald, the park ranger said, as one of a few children the McDonald family, the job of being a cave tour guide was truly the adventure of a lifetime! His enthusiasm for guiding early tours was only exceeded by his interest in exploring and then carefully mapping the endless cave passages and rooms. Young Alvin journaled every excursion into Wind Cave and complimented his discoveries with a collection of cave geological specimens. His explorations took him ever deeper and deeper through miles of uncharted passageways, chambers and formations. All was accomplished with nothing but candles, ladders, rope and spools of cotton string used to find his way back to the entrance. With his ever-increasing knowledge of the cave, young Alvin soon proclaimed himself to be ""Chief Tour Guide"" and had truly was the lead expert on Wind Cave. 

 To this day, the ranger said, Alvin has meticulously mapped more of Wind Cave than any other explorer! We were told that Alvin's journal was on display in the Visitor's Centre and is now available online for any interested readers.

 The ranger next told of how Alvin's work continued through his late teenage years and that, as a young adult, he had travelled by train to the Chicago World's Fair of 1893. At the fair, Alvin had erected a display to promote tourism to his beloved Wind Cave. With a growing knowledge of the cave, the ranger continued, Alvin had decided to pursue a college degree in the field of geology. Soaking-in all the tales of this brave and curious young explorer, it was with the next bit of information that I suddenly felt as though a bulb had been turned-on; a dramatic clue that suddenly illuminated the otherwise completely mysterious nature of my earlier sickness! The revealed that Alvin, now just twenty years of age, had contracted typhoid while in his first year of college and, after returning home, soon died as the result of typhoid fever.

 It was with those words and the supposed end of Alvin's life-story that I then walked up to the ranger and, well out of earshot of other tourists asked, ""Is there any chance that Wind Cave has a history of being haunted?""

 The ranger looked back at me and with a slight chuckle replied, ""Ohhhh, there sure is!""

 ""Let me guess"", I countered, ""It's the kid who did all the tours isn't it?"" 

The ranger grinned so as to confirm my guess and said, ""Yeah, it's Alvin alright... Alvin McDonald"".

 The ranger went on to tell me that the haunting information is always saved for presentation at the end of the tour so as to avoid frightening tourists while they're deep underground. That turned out to be the case when, at the conclusion of the tour, the entire group learned of Alvin's long spiritual presence in the cave. The ranger mentioned that a logbook is kept in the Visitors Center recording a countless number of experiences that guests and staff alike have had over the years. There is an actual photo captured by spelunkers (cave explorers) showing a faint image of a boy they believe to be Alvin. The ranger said that it is standard tour procedure of counting each person going into and coming out of the cave assures all have safely left the chambers, but that rangers are also trained to stop and perform an extra count if anyone in old-style clothing suddenly appears on a tour.

 It really wasn't until days and even years had passed after my first visit to Wind Cave that I had pieced together some of the details about that day. It was only after watching many of the ""ghost hunting"" shows that later become popular on cable television that I'd heard of the ""overwhelming feelings of dread"" that people supposedly experience in the presence of, or while being overtaken by a spirit being. It was this ""overwhelming dread"" that best describes the emotion I'd felt as I had thought ""we are all going to die in the cave."" 

 I suspect that the spirit of Alvin McDonald had attempted to draw life energy from me, or temporarily inhabited the being of myself and likely the other man while we waited in line for the tour. I suspect that the park ranger, as a part of his training and experience, had come to know that by having an afflicted person stand near him, the spirit and sickness would depart. If I had informed the ranger that I was experiencing the trauma, suspect that, like the other afflicted man waiting in line, that the ranger would have also instructed me to come stand near him. I guess the inference is that, for some reason, Alvin's spirit prefers to stay clear of park rangers.

 Whenever I don't actually know something for certain, I try to make it a point to use words like ""suspect"" and ""supposedly."" In some cases, however, it is worth mentioning that a particular experience can be accompanied by a certain feeling of knowing. Also, I specifically have never cared for the word ""believe."" To me the word ""believe"" infers something like; ""I don't really know, but I so want it to be true that I'm just going to go ahead and accept that it is."" To me, nothing could be worse! I find that entire concept not only bothersome, but historically dangerous. Way too many wars have been fought and people hurt and killed over such unsubstantiated ""beliefs."" Not only is there not anything wrong with not knowing, but it is also precisely the amazing mysteries that contributes to lives worth living! 

 So, to be clear, I do not know that the spirit of Alvin McDonald jumped me or the other gentleman waiting in line that morning at Wind Cave, but it does seem to make logical sense given all the history and details. In some ways, as a bonus perhaps, I do get the distinct feeling that it is true. 

 Years later, researching a bit more about Wind Cave and Alvin McDonald online, I found two photos of him. One photo is of a younger Alvin standing with his family in front of their Wind Cave home. There is also a more common online photo of Alvin at about the time he was starting college. I was surprised to read that Alvin's remains had been buried in a marked grave near Wind Cave's entrance, but that I hadn't noticed any such grave or signage when I had visited. Reading on, I discovered his gravesite is actually located somewhat farther down a ravine and then up a small hill that is nearer the original cave entrance (as discovered by the two boys who had been out hunting back in 1881). Several years later, accompanied on another trip west with my mother, we camped again at the Wind Cave campground where I had stayed so many years before. On that trip, on another warm early summer evening, I made it a point to find and then sit for a while at Alvin's grave. Marked by a large boulder and commemorative plaque, I had hoped for some special spiritual experience, but none materialized. I did, and still do feel a certain affinity and affection for the brave young explorer and was glad to have had a chance to simply spend quiet time at his gravesite. I cannot help but to feel that Alvin does live-on.

 Despite the distress and serious discomfort, I'd experienced that morning waiting in line at Wind Cave, I feel compelled to say that I do not sense that, if true, Alvin McDonald's spirit harbors any ill-will, or is in any way ""evil' in his intentions. Of course I do not know, but perhaps Alvin simply seeks to protect the cave he so loved and, for some reason, wants, or needs the energy of physical beings to go about his work and interests. Perhaps Alvin selects people from a crowd based upon his affinity to them... Or perhaps that is all just my own wishful thinking.

 On yet another long summer trip in what my fourth (and a bit larger) travel van is now, I had had the pleasure of meeting the acquaintance of yet another park ranger while camping at Utah's stunning Canyonlands National Park. The ranger had worked at Wind Cave for a considerable amount of time earlier in his career. He told me of a time when, while replacing deteriorated cave lighting wires, and chatting with co-workers, he was suddenly pushed from a step stool on which he'd been standing. According to the ranger, he had felt actual hands push him off the stool though no one was nearby. The ranger went on to describe how, when he was pushed, he had been making a few rather disparaging comments about a woman while carrying on banter with some other male co-workers. ""I'm sure it was Alvin,"" he said. 

 The ranger went on to say that for workers at Wind Cave, Alvin's spirit is a widely accepted reality. He also shared the story of a fellow worker who, while hiking the ravine area just below Alvin's gravesite, had encountered a Native American wearing authentic clothing including a full ceremonial feather headdress. According to his account, the Native American man then vanished just as quickly as he had appeared!

 While I don't relish the sickness I had endured, I still hope to return to Wind Cave someday to hover in some tour lines waiting for a chance to witness or observe the effects of Alvin's visit. It also occurs to me that Wind Cave would seem to be an ideal site for an in-depth scientific research into the mysteries of spirit life.

WIND CAVE WILL BE ALRIGHT 

 (This song lyric has not been recorded to-date) 

A dark feelin' of dread swept over me 

It got so bad I could hardly breathe 

Waitin' with all the rest in-line 

Somethin' had drained my energy 

As the doors swept open it leapt from me

And then with the ranger's loud decree

Down into the mouth we all went

Way down deep in Wind Cave ta-see

The tour went on n-the ranger's tale was told 

Of a boy back in the days of old 

Lead folks all through the cave he loved 

For a quarter plus the candle's sold 

Alivin McDonald the cave will be alright

You should walk-on to the light

The Park Service will handle this

You go rest in the afterlife

Alvin -now you go rest in the afterlife

Musical refrain

Alvin's family ran Wind Cave's first tours 

And taken by the cave's alure

Went to school for geology 

A time when typhoid had no cure 

Was he the reason for my misery? 

The answer to this mystery? 

Asked the ranger and he confirmed 

Wind Cave's long-haunted history

Alvin McDonald the cave will be alright

You should walk-on to the light

The Park Service will handle this

You should go rest in the afterlife

Now you go rest in the afterlife

Alvin -now you go rest in the afterlife"
"At The Hermitage","Tennessee","Haunted Places","AT THE HERMITAGE

 Being country music fans, my parents and I had decided to take a spring road trip from Wisconsin to Nashville, Tennessee. It was a nice break from work and after a long winter, the warmer weather was most appreciated. As we made our way south through the Smokey Mountains, the dogwood trees along the interstate were all in-bloom. We'd stopped to tour Mammoth Cave and then planned to visit The Grand Old Opry, Opryland Amusement Park (now defunct), and to take a cruise down the Cumberland River on the General Jackson Showboat.

 On one morning at our Nashville hotel, we'd awoken to some unexpected rainy weather and were looking for something to do before the forecasted sunshine had arrived. In a hotel lobby display rack, I came across a brochure for a place called ""The Hermitage"". The strange name of this attraction had caught my eye and looking-over the brochure I discovered ""The Hermitage"" to be the name that President Andrew Jackson had given to his cotton plantation located just east of Nashville. Now a National Historic Landmark, The Hermitage is where ""Old Hickory"" had lived throughout most of his adult life and until his death in 1845. It appeared to be fairly close to the city and possibly an interesting place to ride-out the rain. 

 I don't recall a lot of details about the guided mansion tour itself other than how surprised I was at seeing how small all of the beds were and of learning how much shorter people were back then. I found it somewhat unsettling to think of our revered forefathers as all being dwarf-like, but then remembered that Abraham Lincoln was 6'4"" tall. George Washington was 6'2"" at the height of his -well, at the height of his height! Ben Franklin had almost hit 6 foot tall. Did these people have longer beds than everyone else, or did taller people in those days simply get shorted on the foot-end of beds? I guess the mystery prevails!

 After completing the guided tour of the mansion itself, we exited a rear door to explore the grounds. Strolling down to a path that led to the gardens, we were greeted by sunshine as the rain had subsided. As we walked on the path, I was surveying the various farm buildings and thinking about all of the work and activity that must have been going-on back in the time Old Hickory. Looking over to my left, I saw a long rectangular hewn-log building where a young black woman leaning peacefully against one of its longer sides. Wearing a full-length off-white dress and apron, she appeared to be taking a rest from her work. What I immediately noticed was that there was something about her that seemed almost photographically serene and beautiful. Though the clothing she wore was simple and old fashioned, she seemed poised, elegant and somehow almost angelic. In her arms she held a very large basket that was shaped like an Asian wok. The shallow basket looked to be a few feet in diameter, and I thought how impractical it's rounded bottom would be in that the basket would wobble when set on a table. Her basket held several bundles of straw-like cuttings; each wrapped with a band of cloth. This also struck me as a strange thing to do; why would anyone bother bundling straw, wheat, or anything other grass product?

 Aside from these details, I was mostly struck by the young woman's graceful look and pose as she rested against the side of the building in the warm sunshine. I assumed she was playing the role of a slave woman and waiting for tourists to visit her building upon which time she would present her talk on what it was like to have lived and worked as a slave at The Hermitage. I nudged my mother walking beside me planning to point-out the young woman and my expectation of roll-playing characters on the mansion grounds when, still looking at the beautiful young woman, she suddenly vanished! In the blink-of-an-eye she was gone!

 My first thought was that the young woman must have stepped back and into a doorway that I hadn't noticed, but how could she have possibly moved so quickly? As I stepped off the path and began visually searching the side of the building for a doorway, or any opening at all! My mother laughed a bit at my unusual behavior and asked what I was doing. I just felt confused and told her of the young woman who had been leaning against the building.

 Next, I spotted what appeared to be an employee wearing a tan colored ranger-like uniform standing up the path nearer the gardens. I went ahead of my parents and asked the employee if The Hermitage had personnel dressed in period clothing playing the role of plantation workers from the 1800s. She was familiar with the practice but informed me that The Hermitage had no such personnel. Perhaps looking confused, the uniformed staffer then asked the reason for my question. I described what I had seen. She then chucked knowingly and quipped, ""Oh yes- that happens here a lot!"" I didn't understand her comment (as I hadn't yet made the connection to a possible spirit apparition) and asked, ""...what happens here a lot?"" She informed me that The Hermitage was considered one of the most haunted historical sites in the United States and then asked me if we had been over to tour the log building where I had seen the young woman. My first thought was that the building itself hadn't looked particularly interesting to me, but simply responded that we had not. She then informed me that the building had been the slave quarters for President Jackson's many slaves. 

 We went on to walk the gardens, visit President Jackson's tomb and walk the outbuildings including the slave quarters, but I saw no other apparitions. Strangely, as I look back on the experience, I seem to have simply moved on that day -never giving the entire experience much after-thought.

 Years later, while assisting a friend with his thesis paper at a Wisconsin university library, I ran across a book that was titled something like ""America's Most Haunted Places."" Glancing through the table of contents, I quickly noticed that The Hermitage was listed among the haunted sites. Also, many years later, curious about the large wok-shaped basket and bundled straw cuttings, I discovered that both were common to the time period. The large wok-shaped baskets were designed to toss and then catch harvested seeds (such as wild rice and barley) into the wind. The practice allowed the chaff (thin dried outer skin) of the seeds to be blown off before being used for food. The bundled straw-like stems that I had seen in the basket were cut and bundled by size during the busy harvest season. Later, when the slower winter months provided time, the bundled stems could then be pulled from storage and made into baskets and brooms.

 Considering that it is completely possible for anyone to experience realistic hallucinations, I particularly liked the detail of the unusual basket and bundles. If I were hallucinating, and it should be noted that I seldom use alcohol or any drugs, how could my mind fabricate something so specific and of which I had no prior knowledge? Also, on that day at The Hermitage, I had not been particularly engrossed in, or even all that impressed with the tour of the mansion itself or the experience overall. Simply put, I found the tour mildly interesting, and I appreciated its historical value but had not been deep in-thought about slavery, or any other aspect of the experience that would have precipitated delusional visions.

 To this day, what I remember most vividly and am still most impressed by when recalling the experience, is just how palpable the serenity and peacefulness of the young slave woman had been. She seemed so angelic leaning against the side of that building as the rain had given way to sunshine by the gardens. My emotional sense is that this young woman, after what most likely would have been a very difficult life, seemed to have found an incredible peace in her afterlife. I came away with some certainty that a physical body must have an equally whole though fainter spirit body that transcends physical death. In fact, the word ""afterlife"" strikes me as a misnomer in that we likely undergo a seamless transition into the spirit version of ourselves. As a crude example, water can exist as a liquid, solid as ice, as a fog or steam vapor, or as an invisible molecule in the air we breathe. Just because we can't see it does not mean that it is gone! 

THE ANGEL THAT APPEARED TO ME

 (Not recorded as a song to-date) 

Turned a rainy day in Tennessee 

Where it was Nashville, we'd come ta-see 

But the skies had given-up their blue 

So what's a bummed traveler ta-do? 

What's a bummed traveler ta-do? 

Saw a brochure by the hotel desk

Bout where Ol-Hickory's laid ta-rest

At the Hermitage jist-east-a-town

N-so east we were a-travel-bound

So east we were all travel bound

We toured Jackson's plantation mansion

The courtyard out back quite expansive 

Where in a spot peaceful and shady

Stood the most lovely brown young lady

So serene was that young lady

She wore a dress and apron of-old

In-arm a shallow basket ta- hold

Staring at her -lovely as could be

In a wink she disappeared on me!

This woman up-n vanished on me

Spottin' a guide -I told what I'd seen

Of what seemed a super-nat'ral bein'

Not at-all surprised she said ta-me

You're not the first one that's come ta-see

This place's haunted history

Where she'd been standin I later found

Were the slave quarters way back round

When cotton was king at the mansion

Picked by slaves of President Jackson

All the slaves of President Jackson

So if yer skies cloud in Tennessee

Dampen plans on what ya-hoped ta-be

Perhaps go out n-see Ol-Hickory

N-the angel that appeared ta-me

N-the lovely angel -that appeared to me"
"Paramedic - Creepy Doa","Connecticut","Haunted Places","I'm posting this here because I've had a few stories that I can't explain and I don't know who else to tell without sounding crazy. I am a paramedic in a busy city. I am typically one of two paramedics on the overnight- 6pm -6am. 

About two weeks ago, I went to a call for a cardiac arrest (dead person) and my job is to obviously attempt to make them undead and if salvageable, bring them to hospital for care.

Upon arrival at the apartment building, I meet with Fire fighter EMTs and two Police officers. As I walk up to the front door there is a man sitting in a patio chair smoking a cigarette, he was wearing a white wife beater and eyes looked blank... Like the lights on and nobody is home kind of stare people give you when they first wake up out of a deep sleep. Honestly, I just assumed he was a drug addict or something and nodded and didn't say anything because I don't give patient information out to bystanders. He looks at me and says ""hey...hey! I remember you, is he alright up there!?"". I got a bad feeling about the man, I don't know how to explain it. I am very desensitized to the sick and dead people and I typically don't feel emotion anymore when dealing with things like death and sickness/injury but this man just gave me a bad/dark feeling. I didn't think much about it and I go upstairs to the third floor apartment.

I see the same exact man upstairs with rigor and lividity at the end of a bed in a small bedroom - aka: obviously dead, he was at the foot of a twin sized mattress on his knees with blood around his feet and appeared to have some injury to back of head. I confirm he is dead medically and leave my DOA (dead on arrival) with officer and go downstairs to notify who I assume is his twin brother or something because nobody else is on scene besides his neighbor who found him. The man isn't there anymore, I asked neighbor where the man went and if he has a twin and neighbor has absolutely no idea what I'm talking about... And no man was outside smoking a cigarette per Fire/police. They had no idea what I was talking about. 

I have a few other stories but that is the most recent one."
"Labor Day Encounter","Tennessee","Misc","I am going to preface this story by stating that I'm not entirely sure what exactly happened to me, but based on other occurrences in my life and the experiences of others, I believe a supernatural element was involved.

This past holiday weekend, something extraordinary, although for me, unexplainable happened. 

It's a long one, fair warning!

To provide some additional context to what occurred, I should explain that anyone that knows me, knows I enjoy listening to the old Casey Kasem AT40 countdowns from the 70's & 80's. I have an online station that plays them non stop 24/7, alternating between the 2 decades. Every holiday during the summer from Memorial Day-Labor Day, the station plays a marathon of the year end countdowns from 1970-1987. This was during Casey Kasem's original time there (he left for various reasons in August of 1988 but returned to reboot AT40 in 1998) this station specifically played only the countdowns from that time period of 1970 (when the show originally started) to when Casey left in August of 1988. I had heard these marathons before and enjoyed them, the best of the best from that time period, and when they end with the year end countdown of 1987, they resume normal programming (various countdowns from the 70's & 80's) I had caught them on Memorial Day and July 4th, nothing unusual. 

This weekend was no different. I had just planned on enjoying an extended relaxing weekend after the crazy month I had and just listening to music, reading, napping, and having some good food. 

One thing to note, is lately, I had wondered what the countdowns sounded like when Casey rebooted the show, I hadn't heard them from 1998 on, because my music tastes were drawn more to the past and I wasn't aware of any local stations that broadcast AT40 at that time (internet replays weren't much of a thing during that period as the internet was still new). I had also been wondering about a certain Celine Dion song from the late 90's and how it placed. 

The weekend seemed to start off normal enough but on Sunday, I started to feel bizarre. I felt a sort of anticipatory energy, kind of like when you're patiently waiting for Christmas morning to arrive for presents etc. My body seemed to be on an alert awareness. I couldn't figure out why, there was nothing out of the ordinary that I was expecting (or so I thought). Either way it was disconcerting, the countdowns/music, actually helped keep me grounded, but I still felt adrift, if that makes any sense. It was unfamiliar territory, but at the same time, not alarming, just different. 

For some reason, I had this nagging feeling lately to clear pictures off the wall in my bedroom. Where some people have cluttered homes, I have cluttered walls. I love pictures and paintings, and have put so many of them up, some of my walls can look like collages. For some reason Sunday, I finally cleared most of that wall, just felt like it. 

The unusual feelings seemed to increase as night fell. I finally retired to the bedroom, to relax and watch TV. Around 9:30PM, things got interesting. Not to try for TMI but I suddenly started using the bathroom a lot, which was strange because it had been more than 4 hours since I had drank anything. I actually was starting to worry about dehydration, but I wasn't thirsty. This type of body behavior was abnormal to say the least. 

Around 10PM. I heard noises like wood cracking near the front door which ironically was on the other side of the wall I had cleared earlier. I've heard similar noises before, and attributed them to the house settling, but the sequence of noises was different somehow his time. Then I suddenly got a feeling of something being very off, not my physical senses, more like a psychic or inner knowing. There wasn't time to think anything because the lamp by my bed started flickering and it never does this. I've had power interruptions before but not like this, the TV was on and wasn't disturbed at all. The light was on the side of the bed closest to the wall I mentioned. I 'saw' something pass on the left side, but it was very unclear, (I'm not even sure I saw it physically) it was kind of like watching the heat rising off a sidewalk on a hot day. At the same time, as I was considering how out of character the light was acting and the sudden onset of odd feelings, (I was more curious than frightened) it happened!

I felt an energy field/wave enter my body from the left side near my shoulder (at a close diagonal from the lamp) and move through my body and pass out my right side. Another crack of wood happened at the front door and everything seemed normal again except for the way I was feeling. I was wide awake, and too much had happened too fast. I didn't sense sentience from the energy, but there was definitely purpose. My rational mind was on overload and I think I went into a state of shock. Everything I picked up was from from my psychic/other senses and my mind couldn't explain it, so it dismissed the event. 

The next day, sleep helped restore some sense of balance, but things still felt off. I was resting more than usual, I hadn't slept as much as I'd like to, and had bizarre dreams that I couldn't fully recall, but I enjoyed listening to the music, it was soothing.

Finally in mid afternoon, I happened to be listening to the year end countdown of 1987 as it ended. The commercial which announced the special they had been running all weekend long for all year end countdowns from 1970-1987 came on again and then it got bizarre again. 

There was a pause and a brief interruption and then new music and a new intro played instead of reverting back to the regular array of 70's/80's countdowns. Then the announcement came on that the year end countdown for 1998 was being broadcast! This had never happened before, the station up to now was specific for the original run of countdowns from 1970-1988! The commercial I just heard stated the marathon would end with the 1987 year end countdown, yet somehow they were playing the top 100 songs of 1998! What's more, Casey announced that that particular Celine Dion song I had wondered about would be in this countdown. 2 birds, one stone, the very things I had wondered about in an offhand way came to pass!

I listened to the entire countdown, though it wasn't really my era, (I was worried if I turned it off, whatever I had been tapped into would end) and that experience was in of itself worthy of writing another post about, the effect it had on me! When it ended, the station reverted back to its previous lineup, I caught the next 2 countdowns just to check the air dates, and everything seemed normal or as expected at least.

I have no explanation, but when I started listening to that new countdown, my memories from last night and the previous day came flooding back, like some kind of puzzle pieces being put together, as if it all was on hold until this event! Even clearing the wall, when I tried to think about that part of it, a phrase from that movie came into my mind ""Build it and they will come."" That made me laugh, but I've had trouble processing everything else, whatever it was did affect me and it was significant. 

I know that when the energy wave passed through me, I didn't get chills, it didn't feel negative, in fact it seemed more neutral than anything else. Whatever it was, seemed to pass through the front door at a slight diagonal, through the wall, the lamp and then me. Where it went, I'm not sure, I had a vague sense it moved to the opposite wall. A lot happened, very fast, but due to my alert/aware state and my natural curiosity I managed to mentally catalogue it. It didn't really start to hit me until Labor Day with that countdown. The lamp by the way is fine, no blown bulb, it's worked without a hitch since, just as it did before. 

I can only venture guesses as to what may have occurred, in time I'm sure it will be made known to me. Perhaps even the countdown thing can be explained, yet the timing with it and everything else cannot! I still feel it noteworthy to share as that came though for sure!"
"The Ghost In The Orange Grove","Arizona","Orbs / Lights / Mists","When I was a teen in the 80's, I was sent to a girls school for wayward youth. I came from a turbulent upbringing and had run away several times with wild kids. The home I was sent to consisted of a creepy old mansion located in the middle of an orange grove in Mesa, Arizona. I was confined to this old house with several other girls who had pissed off their parents to some extent. We attended local schools and were required to walk from the old house through the orange groves, about one mile to catch the bus at 6 a.m. While it was still dark. There were migrant workers in the fields but what I saw that pre-dawn hours was something extremely different and it still haunts me to this day.

 It happened on a typical school day while walking through the orange groves on a very dark morning. I entered into the trees walking down a dirt road. As I got deeper into the groves I saw huge circular colored lights that were spinning. To my knowledge it was definitely a UFO. The circular object kept spinning through the trees and I was literally scared to death. The colored lights spun through the trees: I was gob smacked. I stood in the dark witnessing the entity spin through the trees. I refocused my eyes and saw a migrant worker standing nearby. He didn't look as if he'd seen anything. It must have been just a couple minutes that I saw the entity. As fast as it appeared, it suddenly disappeared. Right before my eyes.

 It was my one and only sighting with what I believe to be an entity or UFO. Today, I definitely believe in the paranormal, ghosts, UFO's."
"Family Experience","Arizona","Family / Friends Visits","The day before my grandpa's funeral was a somber one. I found myself staying in a hotel just across the street from the funeral home. I had never been close to my grandpa, my dad's father, but his passing still left a heavy weight on my heart. I couldn't help feeling a sense of sadness and loss, knowing that I would never have the chance to truly get to know him. As I lay in bed that night, I couldn't sleep. My mind was swirling with memories of my grandpa, and how I wished I had spent more time with him.

 In the middle of the night, I was jolted awake by the feeling of someone sitting on the edge of my bed. My first thought was that it was my dad or mom, checking on me. But when I looked over, they were both fast asleep. To my surprise, it was my grandpa, looking at me with a friendly smile. I rubbed my eyes, thinking it was just a dream. But when I opened them again, he was still there. He reached out and patted my hand, and I felt an overwhelming sense of comfort wash over me. I fell back to sleep, thinking it was just my mind playing tricks on me.

 The next morning, I told my parents about my strange encounter. They dismissed it as a dream, but deep down, I couldn't shake off the feeling that maybe it was my grandpa's way of saying goodbye.

 Fast forward 15 years later, and I found myself in my childhood bedroom, this time for my aunt's funeral. She had always been like a second mother to me, and her passing was a devastating blow. As I lay down to sleep, I felt someone give me a hug. I turned around, half-expecting to see my parents, but instead, I saw my aunt. She smiled at me, her eyes filled with gratitude. Her daughter had hit rock bottom, and I had been there to support her through it. I think my aunt came to thank me for that.

 These two experiences made me realize that even in death, our loved ones find a way to reach out to us. It was then that I truly understood the impact of our actions on the ones we leave behind. And it was also a reminder that our loved ones never truly leave us, they live on in our memories and the impact they had on our lives. As I stood at my aunt's funeral, tears streaming down my face, I knew that these two stories would stay with me for the rest of my life. They were a testament to the unbreakable bond we share with our loved ones, even after they are gone. Thank you for reading my story."
"I Just Wanted To Make A Reservation...?","Arizona","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","This story, we're getting in the Way Back Machine and travelling back to the year 2015. It was about a week before my senior prom and I was going to make reservations at the local Olive Garden for me and my best friend. I got the normal greeting, ""Thank you for calling Olive Garden at ____. How can I help you?""

 Now, I was 17 years old and a little nervous because I didn't even make my own doctor's appointments yet. I said ""Uhh... Hi. I'd like to make a dinner reservation?"" And I was then put on hold. I don't know how many of you have ever actually CALLED an Olive Garden, but there's usually really tacky Italian music playing when you're on hold. Not this time. Instead of music, there was this loud whistling sound, almost like wind whistling through a window screen during a rainstorm. I tried to listen because I swore I could hear words in with the whistling / swishing sound.

 And boy, oh boy, DID I HEAR WORDS. Mixed in with all of the swishing sounds, I heard a voice that sounded similar to Gollum from Lord of the Rings. I couldn't make out what was said at first and then I blatantly heard ""You're the WORST kind of cold."" I remember just feeling my insides freeze and then the wind sounds stopped and it switched to the Italian music. Within seconds, the host or whoever was going to take my reservation picked up and helped me out. With the way I dragged this out, it sounds like the whole ordeal was like... 5 minutes. In reality, it was probably 1.5 - 2 minutes. Easily one of the strangest things I've ever experienced. Ten years later, I can still hear the voice in my head."
"A Friendly Reminder","Arizona","Family / Friends Visits","I remember like it was yesterday, the day that changed everything. It was a sunny day, the kind that makes you feel like anything is possible. As I walked out the door, I couldn't help but smile, enjoying the warmth of the sun on my skin. I made my way to the car port, ready to start my day. But as I looked up, I saw something that made my heart drop.

 Across the street, I saw my neighbor, the guy I had known since we were kids, walking down the road. I could tell something was different about him, he looked lost and distant. But then he saw me and waved, giving me a small smile. I remember thinking it was odd, he just got taken away in an ambulance the day before. I had heard his dad yelling for help and saw the flashing lights as they took him away. I had been worried about him, wondering what had happened. But here he was, walking down the street as if nothing had happened.

 Excited to see him, I quickly ran inside to tell my mom. But as soon as the words left my mouth, her expression changed. She looked at me with sadness in her eyes and said, ""I don't think so. I just got off the phone with his dad and he just died like 5 minutes ago."" My whole world stopped in that moment. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Just yesterday, he was fine and now he was gone. It felt like a dream, a cruel and twisted one.

 As the reality sunk in, I couldn't help but feel a sense of guilt. If I had known, I would have gone to see him one last time. But instead, I had just waved and went on with my day. From that day on, every time I see someone walking down the street, I can't help but remember that sunny day when I saw my friend for the last time. I learned that life can change in an instant, and to always cherish the moments with the people we love."
"My Experience At Work","Arizona","Haunted Places","Working at Food City in Mesa, Arizona was both mundane and chaotic. As a part-time employee, I had seen my fair share of strange occurrences within the store's walls. But nothing could have prepared me for the series of events that took place one fateful day. It was a typical afternoon shift and I was tasked with organizing the freezer section. As I was stacking boxes of frozen goods, I noticed a dark shadow moving swiftly across the back door. Curiosity got the best of me and I ran outside to catch a glimpse of the mysterious figure. But to my surprise, there was no one there. The pallets I had left outside completely blocked any possible escape route. I quickly called my manager to check if any other employee was in the back room with me, but the answer was a resounding no. I couldn't shake off the unnerving feeling that lingered in my mind for the rest of the day. 

As closing time approached, I was assigned to tidy up the aisles. That's when I saw her - a lady walking awkwardly towards me. But before she could reach me, she made a sharp left turn and disappeared into the shelves. I was frozen in fear and quickly made my way out of there, not daring to look back. I decided to call it a day and left the store in a hurry.

 Little did I know, my co-worker had an even scarier encounter that day. He was upstairs checking on the stereo system for the music when he saw a little girl sitting on top of it. Without wasting a second, he ran out of there and never went back up again. Needless to say, the both of us were spooked beyond belief. We couldn't explain what we saw or experienced that day at Food City. But one thing was for sure - none of us wanted to be alone in that store ever again. And as I walked out of the store, I couldn't help but wonder what other secrets were hidden within those walls."
"Abduction It Seems","Washington","Misc","On April 15, 2023, I entered my Stick Indians story here on YGS. Within 3 weeks of it popping back into my mind I sent the story here. I really had no idea 2 visions were going to break loose from my memory in a little over a year. In my stick Indians story this happened in 1990 alone in my cabin. I had a crazy loud rattle over my house encounter and then erased from my memory for 33 years. I asked my wife and my friend who lived in a trailer on the side of the cabin from 1992 and bought it from me and still lives there today and we worked together for over 10 years, and I had never mentioned it to him or my wife. WHAT?

 I stated in my Stick Indian story it may have lasted 10 minutes or more. I feel the fear and panic I was under it was probably a lot less time as I do not remember telling myself WOW I SURE AM GLAD THATS OVER WITH. I also know it was not a helicopter over my cabin looking out upstairs window 2 ft away no lights and no prop wash in my trees next to window. About 6 months after sharing Stick Indians here on YGS I had my first strange vision or recollection.

 I do not know how but all of a sudden, I am seeing a white triangle, and it is literally taking up all my vision area, really close to my face. It seems to be about 12x12x12 inches each side. I see 3 knob looking things in all 3 corners of this triangle, they are about 1 1/2 inches long and about 1/2 inch wide, round and look metal. It looks like a long roller bearing and seems to be less than 6 inches from my face. At the top point of triangle this knob is strait up and down. The lower rt hand corner knob is angled at 4 O'clock to the outside point and the inside of this knob is about 9 O'clock a slight angle, and the left corner knob is angled at 2 O'clock to the inside and 8 o'clock down in the corner area. I mentioned a metal sounding rhythmic rattle; it seemed 3 things were spinning together making this noise so now after months of this thing in my thoughts I have convinced myself that this is the noise maker and these 3 bearing looking things spin together at the same time and this is my troublemaker, this gadget took me out. I have mentally wasted too much time on this in my face white triangle, pyramid thing. The wife gives me the LOOK when I bring it up.

 My 2nd vision, recollection is around 6 to 8 months after the first vision.

 It seems I am standing on my own I cannot move my head only my eyes, looking straight ahead. I notice I am surrounded by low shine dull stainless, foil looking metal. Strait in front of me a metal wall 20 ft wide counting dark as night opening and around 25 ft or more away scanning left to right there is an amazing looking wall reinforcing pillar. It seems to be 14 inches wide at top ceiling area and it goes down and outwards following the wall to the floor and seems to be around 24 inches wide at the floor. It looks like whitish raw aluminum and bottom right of support maybe 4 inches away from the bottom of this pillar at the floor is a rounded start of end wall and next to opening as dark as night. AND THERE IT IS maybe 5 1/2 ft from the floor mounted in this pillar is my triangle. I can tell buy the pillar the floor is going away at the bottom and the top pillar is closer to me, it's a rounded wall. The ceiling walls and floor is the same metal color. Also there are no seams I can see except the wall to my right has a seam where wall meets ceiling. The wall to my right maybe 10 ft away that stops near the dark as night opening and I think opening is bigger than what I am seeing opening is maybe 7 ft wide. And it is floor to ceiling seem about 9 to 10 ft tall. Wall to my left is also maybe 8 to 10 ft from me and wall stops before outer rounded wall. I feel each end of the walls at their ends could be a walkway. There is decent light, but I don't see its source. There is a beautiful very light blue hue reflecting off the floor. I see no foot prints no dirt on floors or walls very sterile looking. There are no tables, gauges, levers, like on TV only the white triangle next to the dark exit.

 On July 24, 2024, we head to Washington for a graduation. I had arranged a regression session a week earlier at 9.30 am with a lady I used many years ago. After 1 1/2 hours we had no luck at all, but she did take a copy of the picture of my triangle.

 Now I feel it's time to share what has happened so far. By 12:30 this same day I am standing across the street from my old property in Shelton Washington. I hugged a big, beautiful cedar tree. I could only get my arms halfway around it and very thankful to be back here. I miss the cedars. I head across the street to my old cabin. Both brothers, my old friends are sitting at a table. My wife and myself both have covid right now and do not know it, I am hacking a little.

 I go out in the big flat yard looking for round dead area but do not notice anything. Luckily, they both did not laugh at me. UFOS are one thing Abductions are never discussed. On my way out I showed them my copy of the triangle I made, and I also went to the end of the road to show the family that had moved in 2 years later than me. She took a picture of the triangle.

 Somehow, I am going to get this out there, have some made and get them out in that area. Imagine how many hundreds if not thousands of people have seen this triangle on their way off this craft and then out of nowhere pop back in their heads years later like me.

 I do not feel happy by sharing this, it is just another odd thing that's happened to me taking up space in my mind, but this did happen and I have shared it.

 I feel it is the control panel for the outside ramp system. I am sending a picture of this triangle I made out of plastic and cabinet handles it's not perfect, but this is what I saw."
"Doorbell Camera","California","Haunted Places","When I was younger, my cousin and I were really into the paranormal. One day, we went over to our grandma's house while all of the adults talked in the backyard.

 Considering we were really into the paranormal, we decided to look at my grandma's doorbell camera to catch 'scary' stuff. After a few minutes, we didn't see anything so we left. When we walked back in after a good 10 minutes, our aunty, who has been diagnosed with cancer, was resting on the couch and she said someone was ringing the doorbell. We checked the footage and nobody was seen on the camera for the past 30 minutes. 

That's when me and my cousin decided to continue watching the camera. That was until we caught a ghost rushing past. The ghost rushed towards the backyard, which was where everyone else was. We ran to the backyard and told our parents. And of course, nobody believed it. Until this day, nobody knew what that was and what had happened to it. We knew it wasn't fake, for a fact. We went over the footage over and over again and confirmed that it was definitely a ghost. Most likely a ghost that my grandpa, who had passed away, encountered before.

 My grandpa was a very religious guy and most likely will get haunted. A lot of paranormal stuff had happened to my grandpa in that house or in his car until he passed away at least 2 months before this had happened. Not only has my grandpa encountered ghosts but also my uncles. 

 My stories are also confirmed as true by witnesses."
"Cemetery Night To Remember","Arizona","Haunted Places","A couple of years ago, on a cool autumn night, I had an unforgettable experience that will stay with me forever. It all started when a group of friends and I decided to visit the local cemetery after hours. Rumors had been circulating that the cemetery was haunted, and we were curious to see for ourselves if there was any truth to the stories.

I was with a couple of friends in one car, while another friend drove a separate vehicle. As we made our way through the dark and winding roads leading to the cemetery, we could feel a sense of unease creep over us. The night was still and eerily quiet, the only sound being the rustling of leaves in the wind.

As we pulled up to the gates of the cemetery, I could feel my heart racing in anticipation. The gates were locked, but that didn't stop us. We parked our cars outside and decided to explore on foot. The moon cast an eerie glow over the gravestones, creating long shadows that seemed to dance in the darkness.

We walked amongst the headstones, reading the names and dates etched into the cold stone. The air was thick with a sense of foreboding, as if we were not alone in the cemetery. Suddenly, my friend who was driving the other car let out a gasp and pointed ahead. We all turned to look, and that's when we saw it - a small figure darting across the road in front of the truck.

We were all frozen in place, trying to make sense of what we had just witnessed. I felt a chill run down my spine, my arms covered in goosebumps. We quickly got back into our cars as we followed the others out of the cemetery.

As we drove down the dark road, my friend in the other car suddenly slammed on the brakes. We pulled up beside them and rolled down the window, asking what had happened. They explained that they had heard a loud bang on the back of their car, as if something had hit it.

We all got out of our cars to inspect the damage. To our horror, we found small handprints smeared across the back of the car, as if a child had touched it. The realization hit us like a ton of bricks - the figure we had seen running across the road was not a figment of our imagination. It was real.

Fear gripped us as we stood in the darkness, unsure of what to do next. We could feel a presence watching us, a sense of malevolence that sent shivers down our spines. Without a word, we all got back into our cars and drove away from the cemetery as quickly as we could.

To this day, I still cannot explain what we saw that night. Was it the spirit of a restless soul haunting the cemetery, or something more sinister? Whatever it was, it left an indelible mark on me and my friends. We never spoke of that night again, too afraid to relive the terror that had gripped us in the darkness of the cemetery. But the memory of that unforgettable night will always stay with me, a chilling reminder of the thin veil that separates the living from the dead."
"Loved Ones Visiting","Georgia","Family / Friends Visits","My best friend from elementary to high school got in a car accident, and it was two days after he turned 17. He died prom morning.

I can smell the Black and Mild that he smoked every now and then, and I can feel him sit on my bed. It's been 20 years ago now.

My Nanny died in 2008, I was pregnant with my daughter, so she didn't get to see her, but she came to see us one day. She was like a angel all in white.

Scared me at first but I felt at peace. My daughter was young about 3 at the time and saw her too. She's always with us. 

 I can feel good and bad energy and sometimes hear voices. Thanks for letting me tell my story 🙂

I have lost a lot of people in my 38 years of life and a lot were in high school. It was a horrible time back then 😪. 

But when I lost my best friend, that the most horrible feeling in the world because I know he's with me, and I hope it's him and my Nanny watching over us.

The worst part about losing him was he was supposed to take me to prom the day he died.

But the good part was I felt him with me. I swear I feel him with me all the time, I smell his Tommy Hilfiger cologne sometimes.

I will never ever forget him for the rest of my life.

My Nanny was the best grandma anyone could ever ask for, she was crazy, funny, and loved to do Jell-O shots lol. But she's the one who plays tricks on us I think. 

Things move around an disappear out of nowhere and show up a day or week later. I even talk to her and him. I know it sounds crazy but I feel at peace."
"Unexpected Visit's","Texas","Non Human Entities","I need to know something. I see and have seen ghost and I have seen and heard angels as well as demons.

 The other night 3 black winged what I believe to be demon's flew down to me. They said nothing they were about 60 yards from me. I just had one of the least good day's of my life. I did not approach them all the way, because mentally I was already distraught. I felt like if I interacted with them something could go wrong. Being in the current state of mind that I am in now, I wish had approached them. 2 landed on a fence almost like a bird perched, while the other landed on the ground on the same street I was on in a dark alley way. Imagine crossing the road back and forth, it was doing this but it looked as if when you have a strobe like effect. I could see one step and not the next. I walked the other direction. They did not pursue me. I believe they were just alerting me of their presence in my life.

 Has anyone had an experience like this?

 I also saw a ghost with red eyes and believe it or not driving a car. What I believe to be a ghost car. Can anyone tell me what that was or could mean?

 I have seen ghost of people and of animals in the past. I also have seen a UFO. I have been meditating and taping into my spiritual side lately. For a long time I ignored and pushed these thoughts and feelings/sightings away. I have also been studying about magic and different religions. It really is all very interesting. My life has taken a significant turn for what I believe to be better. Reading the rules I will not talk about those other experiences for now. I am just eager to find out what I saw. The 3 dark winged creatures and the red eyed ghost. Thank you for your feedback and taking your valuable time to read my story. Goodbye for now."
"Carol Street Has Some Reflecting To Do","Arkansas","Haunted Places","I moved in the brick home on Carol Street in 2012 not long after my divorce. I didn't meet the folks while we negotiated the deal, but I did work out plans for me to keep several rooms of furniture and many pieces of pictures and art work that were on the walls. 

One particular art piece was a three mirrored, wrought ironed, heavy metal wall hanging left over the kitchen bar. The bar was in the middle of area of the kitchen, the sun-room, the family room, the laundry room/ pantry. 

With bar stools at the bar, you would sit facing the kitchen and this mirrored piece and your back would be to the rest of the house. 

You could actually look into these mirrors, I suppose, and see all through the home from this view point. 

However, the first night in the home, I took the art work down, off the bar, and moved it.

Next morning, I was sitting at the bar only three feet from this mirror to my left. I glanced and couldn't believe this heavy, hanging-on-a-nail, piece of metal was perpendicular to the floor floating in the air! 

As soon as I jumped back, it fell back to the wall, making the loudest bang! (Still hanging on the nail!) 

There were no earthquakes, landslides, noises, anything. 

List of events following:

1) knocked the frame, trim, and paint out of the doorway following me after I walked through 

2) rattled dresser handles

3) knocked on back door with glass and dog sleeping. 

4) lights blew out in bathroom at the same time 

The next owner said a cross on a shelf flew across the room and almost hit her a year later."
"Haunted In The Desert","California","Haunted Places","Back in 2006, I decided to move out of the Inland Empire. It proved to be a mistake due to numerous issues. I found a decent home that was Spanish style built in 1993. In the City of Adelanto in the high Desert. 

 Shortly after moving in odd things began happening. My black and white cat, Sylvia, sometimes would sit near the hallway entry and stare down the hallway. It was as if she was seeing something or someone. Each time I would look to see what she was staring at, I wouldn't see anything. 

Many nights, Sylvia would claw at my bedroom door to get inside with me. It was to the extent of meowing sweeping her paw beneath the door in a desperate plea. It was so weird! I always let her in but I didn't understand why she was behaving this way. 

One day my son, Glenn, asked me if I left any meat out that could have spoiled. I said no! He was searching through the kitchen for bad meat. There was the smell in the air of rotten, bloody, raw meat. However there was no source that could be found that could have contributed to the odor.

 This situation would come and go periodically. You would smell it a few days then it disappeared and returned a month or two later. Our dog would bark while staring at the rooftop on certain nights. There was also the sound of shuffling of feet around the bedroom carpet sometimes.

Other times we would hear the doorknob moving. Things would move on their own. Such as hairbrush or toothpaste sliding from one side of the vanity to the other. 

One night my daughter, Lisa, was jumping rope under the porch light and I heard a blood curdling scream. As I ran out to her she was running inside. She was out of breath. She said that she saw something on the roof. A big hairy and hunched over something with glowing eyes staring at her. 

We all experienced strange things that we can't explain at this house. I always felt like someone was right behind me when I walked down the hallway. My cat was obsessed with staring down that hallway. It was a full year of strange occurrences. 

As soon as I had the chance I moved back to San Bernardino."
"Timothy's Story","California","Photographs / Videos / EVP","Ever since I was about four years old, I have believed that there is a little boy named Timothy that lives in my house. At first it was just an excuse I used whenever things went missing, but as I got older, I realized it was much more than that. I started to become more and more interested in the paranormal and wanted to summon demons and spirits in my bedroom. Just recently, my parents gave me my own room. It was very hard for me to fall asleep the first night and, despite the three fans I had on at the highest/coldest setting, it was very warm. The next night it was easier to fall asleep, but in the midst of my slumber, I was awakened by the sensation that someone was watching me. I convince myself it's just my imagination and use the restroom before going back to bed.

 When I washed my hands, however, I realize that my bathroom mirror is facing the mirror that is by my bed. In case you don't know, you should never put two mirrors across from each other, as it creates a portal for demons, spirits, and other entities to enter in and out of. I was bored recently and decided to use a Spirit Box to try and communicate with Timothy, as I believe he is the spirit that is causing me all this suspicion.

How the conversation went:

Me: Hello, Timothy? I want to share your story to help you be remembered.

Spirit Box: River...See...you...

Me: You see me? Where are you?

Spirit Box:...Earring...love...

[I have earrings by my bathroom mirror, which is directly across from my bed, so I assume that's where he is]

Me: Oh, you like my earrings? Thank you.

Spirit Box:...It will be okay...

Me: I know. I know it'll be okay. I want to help you be remembered, so do you mind sharing the story of how you passed away?

Spirit Box:...car accident...

Me: I'm so sorry. That's horrible.

Spirit Box:...I found nana... Pat...

Me: You found your nana Pat? Was she the one driving? Who else was in the car?

Spirit Box:...List...

Me: You're going to list them? Okay.

Spirit Box:...Blue...Flow...spirit...

Me: Blue, flow... You mentioned a river earlier, did your car sink into a river?

Spirit Box:...Sally... Emma... Flying... Dark...

Me: Was it night when the car flew into the river? Were Sally and Emma in the car with you and Nana?

Spirit Box: Kayleigh... Possibly... Matt...

Me: Kayleigh and Matt were possibly with you too? Okay... So you, Sally, Emma, Kayleigh, Matt, and Nana were all in the car?

Spirit Box:...That was us...

Me: I'm so sorry that you guys' life had to end that way.

Spirit Box: it's...fine...I'm...okay...

Me: That's good. Thank you for talking with me today. Maybe I'll come back later to talk some more. Would you like that?

Spirit Box:...please...

[I ended the investigation after that]

Now, from what I have put together, Timothy is a little boy around the age of 10. His father left a few days after his mom got pregnant, and his mother passed away shortly after Timothy was born. His grandmother took custody of him. He grew up and became relatively close with his cousins Emma, Sally, Kayleigh, and Matt who also lived in the house with his grandmother. One day, they are on a night drive and the grandmother falls asleep behind the wheel. Timothy is the one that realized that she was asleep, and shouts at Sally, who was in the passengers seat, to take the wheel. Sally freaks out, and freezes. The car swerves off of the road and flies into the river. His grandma wakes up and they all start to panic, trying to get out of the sinking car, but it's too late. The car starts to sink, and they all drown to death. That's what I drew out from the investigation. I will be keeping you guys updated if I find out any other details about his past life."
"Our Pet Poodle Barked At An Apparition","Texas","Haunted Places","This occurred back in the late 1960s in a old shotgun framed house we lived at in Houston, Texas when I was a little boy. My father worked nights and I had a case of the chicken pox.

My mother let me stay up late and watch TV on the couch since I couldn't go to school.

 We had a pet toy poodle named Shelly that always slept at the foot of my mother's feet.

My mother and father had some friends that lived down the street who would come over and play dominos or cards with them from time to time while we would have to go to bed.

That particular night my mother and me were watching an episode of the Twilight Zone when my mother's dog Shelly sat up and focused on a shadowy figure at the very end of the hall in the kitchen...

She started to viciously growl and the back of her fur was standing up while backing up to my mother's feet at the shadowy figure, my mother instantly jumped up and turned the hallway lights on but there was nothing there.

But our dog was really disturbed and it really creeped me out. I was only 5 years old. My mother grabbed the phone and called my father who was at work and told him that she thought we had a prowler and wanted him to come home.

I could hear my father's voice through the phone receiver tell my mother to call the police until he could get there. As soon as my mother hung up the phone it rang and my mother picked it up.

It was our neighbor who my parents played domino's with and she was screaming on the other end telling my mother that her husband had just shot himself committing suicide. 

This all happened just about the same time that our pet dog saw that shadow starring at us in the hallway... To this day I remember that event in detail and believe that we saw the ghostly spirit of our neighbor after he had shot himself."
"The Hippie Stared At My Brother","Texas","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","This true event occurred back when I was in high school at a house my parents were renting in Houston, Texas back in the early 1980's. 

One day my brother Joel and I were home alone while my parents were out. I was sitting on the couch watching TV while my brother was in his bedroom asleep.

To better understand how creepy this event was first you must know that a lot of weird things had been happening in that house... We would see shadows move out of the corners of our eyes at times and hear foot steps when no one was there. Next door to our house was a burned out home where the woods and weeds had grown over it from years of neglect...

On that particular summer day while I was watching TV my brother walked out of his room with a strange look on his face and told me ""Keep your friends out of my bedroom."" 

I knew he had been asleep, so I told him, ""Go back to sleep, dude, your dreaming, no one else is here but you and me."" But he insisted that a young guy in his teens with long blonde hair and wearing clothes from the 60's (tie-dyed shirt) was standing in his bedroom doorway when he woke up.

He continued and said that the guy said nothing, he just nodded his head at him as to silently say ""yea, I see you too "" and then just vanished.

We both walked through the house but no one else was there, just my brother and I.

 The next day while I was cutting our lawn I stopped for a few minutes to talk with our other neighbor across the fence and happened to mention the weird things going on and the event that my brother saw the day before.

 After describing what the teen looked like my neighbor turned pale and pointed to that burned down house next to us and told me that when he was a kid in the late 60's a young kid burned up in the house next door to us that fit that description.

 I felt chills run down my back. For years until we finally moved away unexplained strange things would happen in and around the house like doors slamming and the TV turning on and off on its own... It all stopped when we moved away."
"Possible Airbnb Ghost?","Florida","Haunted Places","This incident happened just this morning (6-9-2024) around 6. I really don't know if it was anything paranormal, but it sure was awfully strange...

This is going to be pretty lengthy and the story itself isn't ""scary"", so I just wanted to clarify this first before you proceed. 

This weekend my father and I took a trip to Deerfield Beach, Florida for a family event on Saturday. 

We were given an Airbnb that was initially booked by an uncle in law, but he decided to stay somewhere else and gave the room to us. His wife (my aunt) actually stayed in this particular Airbnb one time before, but on the opposite side - as it is a ranch style duplex home.

When my father and I first arrived late Friday evening we checked out the place and nothing seemed out of the ordinary, so we proceeded to bring in our luggage.

The house had an open plan. As soon as you walk in you are immediately in the living room and a little past that is the kitchen area. Off to the right side of the living room are two bedrooms, a bathroom and what look like two small closet doors. One of the bedrooms is on the right side of the hall and opposite to that on the left side is the other bedroom. The bathroom is on the left side of the hall and immediately after that is one of the bedrooms that I just mentioned. The bathroom and this bedroom has a door between them, so you can actually open this door and immediately walk in between them - Remember the details about this bedroom and the bathroom as they will be important later on. 

The room I chose was a back bedroom and the smallest of the three. It was further past the kitchen area but it was right next to the door that leads to the back yard and the room itself had a window view directly into the backyard. There is a jacuzzi and a little patio area in the backyard, but we never ended up going back there.

My father had initially chosen one of the front bedrooms on the left (the one that will be mentioned later) but he didn't trust sleeping in the bed, so he just decided to sleep on one of the long couches in the living room. 

During our entire stay everything was pretty chill and nothing was out of the ordinary. 

Long story short, after the family event Saturday, my father and I went out to a restaurant then came back later on that night.

It was sometime after 10pm when we got back, but he told me that one of my uncles and his daughter was coming over to visit for a bit. I was so sleepy that I pretty much knocked out instantly. I didn't even get a chance to see them when they came over.

I woke up some time after 4 going on 5am. I laid in bed for a while then shortly after I started browsing my phone.

After about an hour I had to use the bathroom. I got up and while I was walking through the kitchen area I noticed that my dad was knocked out heavy on the couch, I did my business, then went back to bed and starting browsing my phone again. I haven't heard any noise or any sign of my father being up. 

About an hour later I had to use the bathroom again. As I walked out of my room and into the kitchen area I immediately saw a light shining so I thought I left the bathroom light on, but when I went around the corner I saw that the back bedroom light is on! At first I was like ""WTF?"" 

My father was still on the couch in the living room knocked out cold, snoring as loud as can be so I know he was in a deep sleep.

I know my uncle and his daughter came by last night so at first I thought maybe they spent the night? I looked in the room that the light was on in as well as the one immediately across from it and noticed no one is in there. I immediately found this strange and I was a bit confused. 

I already had my phone in hand so I took a video of it for evidence. 

I then reluctantly tried to wake my father up. He was in a deep sleep and snoring loudly, so I hated to even bother him, but I just HAD to know why that light was on.

I started lightly tapping on his hand. Around this exact same time I thought I heard a very light and faint hum-like sound coming from that bedroom, and it sounded like a female voice. I immediately got startled but I tried to rationalize it as me already being on high alert. It was also around this same time that I noticed that it was ice cold in that whole area, and I'm already familiar with that feeling due to past experiences. The AC was running at the time but it was just a very eerie feeling in the atmosphere. Again, I tried to attribute it to the fact that I was already slightly on edge and tried not to assume anything paranormal. Nonetheless that light was on for some reason.

My father finally woke up. I told him ""Hey dad, I didn't mean to wake you up, but why is that light on in the room?"" He was completely out of it and said that he might have gotten up and just forgot he left the light on. He promptly went back to sleep.

As out of it as he was, I know for a fact that he hadn't been up any time recently. In fact, I would've at least heard someone moving around in the house on these tile floors and given the fact that it's pretty much an open plan setup.

I walked over to the room and tried to turn off the light by the two pad switches I saw but neither worked. I saw the remote control for the light and fan so I had to use that to turn off the light... Which made that even more strange. 

I was completely weirded out by this and didn't know what to think. I went back to my room and just tried to get it out of my mind. By this time it was already daybreak and the sun was slightly out.

I laid there for a while, eventually getting sleepy. Before dozing off I went back out to check on things and saw that the light hadn't come back on. But there was this undeniably cold sensation throughout that part of the house. I checked all of the rooms in that area and saw nothing so I went back to my room.

When I got slightly past the kitchen area I felt an eerie sensation, but again, I attributed that to just already being on edge so I tried not to entertain it.

I eventually settled down and dozed off...

I awakened sometime maybe two hours later. When I woke up I promptly checked the house again. I noticed it was still ice cold and my father was still asleep.

He awakened maybe after another hour as I heard him go to the bathroom and start showering. After he came out we greeted each other and I began to tell him about the whole scenario. It was around this time I noticed that the ice cold sensation had finally gone. We talked about it and he said that he might have gotten up and just forgot he left the light on, but he couldn't remember doing it.

We had to check out by 11 so we started getting our things prepared. The remaining time we were there passed by without incident, thankfully. 

I really and truly don't know what to make of what happened, but it was pretty strange...

This is a link to the short video that I recorded showing the incident: https://youtube.com/shorts/TAbCbbv5DPo?si=wYR1xlZH3pc7Bhio"
"Finding Their Way Home","Maine","Pets / Animals","This ghost story entails the start of trauma and sadness regarding some of my best feathered friends.

 My husband and I moved to our current home in 2022. My dream once owning our own home was to start a little homestead with a garden. After we went through our first winter, the following spring I obtained my first flock of chickens. Any animal I bring into my home is considered family, whether it be a simple fish, or farm animal. I had names for my little flock of chickens, including my favorite rooster, Tweedledee.

 The following early fall we purchased some more chickens and were a well bonded happy family. I never free ranged my chickens for their safety, I know we have predators. But we slowly started letting them roam outside with supervision and they stayed with us most of the time. I maintained a relationship with all of my feathered friends, some being closer to me than others, again my roosters always being my best friends, at that point I had 3, Gabriel, Rusty Pete, and Tweedledee.

 The first blow was when my white rooster, Gabriel, died of sudden unknown causes, so I laid him to rest back to nature where he loved to pick bugs and just be in the sun.

 The following weekend I was away in town for a girl's day with my best friend, but when I was coming home, I had a gut feeling something was terribly wrong. I have always known I had the gift of clairsentience, so I feel energies and can picture them in my mind's eye, but never have had the gift of sight or sound.

 When I pulled into my driveway something compelled me to check on my feathered friends, and that's when the pain hit, only 6 of my hens were waiting for me by their coop. I saw the look in my hen's eyes as even my shyest hens came running to be with me. I cried and called for hours for my babies to return home, I begged the universe, I pleaded, and was almost on my knees, my husband only finding one alive and another returning to me from the woods.

 I knew it was a fox as we had seen one in prior months and my husband found a dead hen in our yard in the tall grass. Later that day as I was pleading for anyone to return to me, especially Tweedledee my favorite rooster, it started to downpour, rain mixing with tears as if the sky was mourning with me. I leaned my hand against a tree begging for all of my energy to be sent out to find any chicken that was lost and couldn't make it home. As I was trying to let my energy resonate around my property, I saw a flash of the feather pattern of 3 of my lost hens and a hen on my shoulder, as if one or all three of my Wyandotte hens were saying goodbye.

 I did not give up the search for days, and weeks. At this point as this happened just a few weeks ago. The following weeks I kept hearing my roosters crowing in the woods, but no sign of them alive sadly. When I returned home from work tonight, I was walking to my chicken coop and saw a clear image of my rooster Rusty Pete by the door, just waiting to go in, it broke my heart to see his spirit, but I told him to go in, his girls were waiting for him.

 Upon seeing Pete's spirit the whole night, I had images of my other hens running in my yard and wood line in terror, and the mental scene of a fox sniffing around my chicken coop door hoping to finish the job on the 6 hens he left alive. The scene of the fox manifested for me to even see a flash of fox fur by my chicken coop door that I raced to the aid of my feathered friends when there was nothing there.

 I considered myself a very open person with a fair number of metaphysical gifts, but after this traumatic event, have gained the gift of sight and hearing now, and I know that I need to help my missing girls and roosters find their way home to find peace so they can rest. Going into my wood line now has different meaning, it's quieter, the breeze seems to carry more on it than it ever used to, and in my heart, I know my babies knew I loved them to the point they are starting to seek me out from the next life."
"Unexplained Pillow Tapping","Illinois","Haunted Places","I haven't posted in quite a while, but I am hoping for some help from the great YGS community. In the past week, I have begun hearing a very odd tapping sound coming from under my pillow, something like a finger tapping but with a ""popping"" quality. At first, I assumed it was an inner ear muscular spasm, but my wife has been experiencing this, on and off, for nearly two years! She kept quiet about it until it started keeping her awake at night.

It usually starts with a single tap, then a quick burst of three, followed by another three, and can continue for long periods. At times, it seems like it's coming from the inner ear, but then it is clearly coming from under the pillow. My wife has heard it loudly next to her on the bed. There have also been loud knocks and taps on the room's walls, doors, and other objects. 

My initial thought, which has always worked for intrusive paranormal activity in the past, was to speak aloud, telling whatever it is to please be quiet so we can sleep. This seemed to work for a night but was back with a vengeance last night. I have to head to work soon and didn't get more than a collective couple of hours of sleep. I understand that rearranging the room (for whatever reason) can sometimes help, but I hope someone here on YGS has experienced something similar and knows how to make this phenomenon cease.

My wife and I have experienced quite a few paranormal occurrences in this room - everything from a loud, complex ticking (that I've written about) to shadow figures and disembodied voices. Unlike those incidents, this one doesn't seem to want to stop. Luckily, we will be away for the next four nights, but any ideas or theories will be much appreciated."
"Spirit At Child Care Center","Missouri","Haunted Places","I used to work with this amazing woman who I called the baby whisperer. She had been working in early education since she was a teenager and had 60 plus years of experience in this field. Two years ago, she fell ill and we lost her. She was the heart of our center, she was everybody's Grandma, and everybody loved her. 

During the funeral, about 30 new and old co-workers, teachers, and families who she had impacted, all sat in the same section of the big church that the funeral was held. We joked that it was the *company name* section. Anyway, about half-way through the funeral, the speaker was talking about her career and how much she loved taking care of her babies - during this moment, a giant wreath hung on the church wall, right next to our section, fell to the ground. We all looked at it and each other. We giggled because she WOULD do that, the little spitfire. 

About 6 months after her passing, a co-worker and I were talking while working in her old classroom. I was changing a diaper in the diaper changing area while she was in the classroom section. Two classrooms were connected by a diapering area with a gate to each classroom. All of a sudden, the gate to the other classroom (which was empty) flew open and hit the wall. I thought that someone had walked through the classroom or something, even though we didn't see anyone. I finished up and checked the room. Empty. My co-worker said ""NOPE!"" and moved her and her two babies to the back of the room.

Last year, a co-worker of mine and I were having a conversation. She was getting ready to go on break and had her phone sitting on the half wall in the classroom, about 5 ft from where we were standing. During our conversation, her phone flew off of the half wall onto the floor. We both stopped, looked at the phone on the floor. She calmly said ""Well okay, then.""

The building is 40 years old, our work Grandma worked there since it had opened. I'm not sure of the time frame, but a long time ago, the center had sadly lost an infant to SIDS while being at the center. This was not the only occurrence that happened at this building - there was one other before she had passed away."
"Haunted Property Inside And Outside","Texas","Haunted Places","Again, the people who read some of my other experiences on this site, or are first timers to reading my experiences, you can go back to my first published experience, ""Very Unexplained Experiences"".

This is a mix of some of the other crazy Unexplained experiences I've had at my sister's property on Des Voignes Road in Denison, Texas, just outside town, before she sold the property to a ""flipper"".

One night, I was in the living area of my 30 ft camper. My wife and I were living in on my sister's property. It was in July. Just about an hour after dark.

I just started hearing a Christmas song, don't remember which one, just barely loud enough to hear all of the words to the song. It played over and over for for 2 to 3 hours until I fell asleep. That's all that happened that night.

My wife never experienced anything on this property while we were living there (about a year and a half). She did believe in spirits because the house where she moved from, when we got together, she'd said she'd see a transparent old lady and a cat sometimes. 

At my sister's property, as I would be having an experience, it would stop every time she'd come into the room or near me, wherever I'd be. 

I'd go to the restroom in my camper we were living in on nearly any given night. I'd turn out the light and I swear to God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit that shadows would start swirling around fast every direction until I'd turn the light back on.

I'd get my wife to come into the restroom with me and we'd turn out the light before or after it'd happen to me... NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN with her in there. Ever. 

I'd be up front in the camper and she'd be in the rear in the bedroom. Some nights, I'd hear what sounded like a few people whispering outside the windows.

 Then I'd immediately start hearing what sounded like knives scraping the windows, trying to get the windows unlocked. Like on old houses with the cheap windows which with a knife, you could turn the lock latch and open the windows. I'd call my wife to the front while it'd be happening, and it'd stop."
"2nd Story Window Ghost","Washington","Haunted Places","This happened about 3 years (specifically in 2015) after my family members and I moved into our new home from Canada. I was in middle school (7th grade specifically) at this time of year. I was chilling on the couch in the game room on the 2nd floor of the house. I was in the dark because it was almost 10 pm during the winter time. I was watching CrashCourse videos on history on my phone because I thought they were interesting at that time, and I was kind of obsessed with history during middle school. After a few videos, I felt a sensation that someone was watching me through one of the small windows beside the couch that was around a foot or foot and a half above me. 

I looked up at the window and saw a man's face. He had a wide, toothy grin. He was a bit see-through but he had a slight pastel blue tint or outline to him and was kind of balding in some areas of the head. What stood out to me was his eyes because the eyes looked really bloodshot and really red compared to what I have seen in the past. His neck looked really damaged as well, like the neck looked like it had surgery done on it multiple times and the neck seemed a little bit crooked. I originally didn't process what I was looking at but after the initial shock, I got off the couch and started to back away towards the door of the game room. His head slightly turned sideways and started to smile even more (to the point it looked like it went up to his ears) while still looking at me and starting to drift away from the house. There was another window a few feet away from the one above the couch. I could still see him drifting through the 2nd window. He disappeared when I looked through the big window behind the couch.

I ran back to my room after that and I didn't tell my parents because I knew that they wouldn't believe me because the both of them got their degrees in STEM and didn't believe in the supernatural."
"Invisible But Solid","Texas","Haunted Places","I was living on my sister's property in Denison, Texas in a 30 ft camper at the time. I was outside one day during mid day. I was on the side of my sister's house.

 I had been doing some clearing of brush/vines on her property. I got finished for the day, and walked over to one side of her house and I was about 20 to 30 ft from the outside a/c unit. Out basically away from everything.

 I don't even remember why I jumped back real fast, all of a sudden. But, I knew that I had just knocked my sister or brother in law down, jumping back so quickly.

When I jumped backwards, it felt like 4 or 5 big wooden stubs. As if you'd cut an overgrown bush (where the limbs had grown to about the diameter size of an arm), back down to size where the big limbs were now big stubs.

When I turned around, nothing was there. I hit it hard jumping back quickly whatever it was. I was at least 20 to 30 ft away from anything physical.

 What could it have been? So big and nubby, and hard as wood? This was just one of many experiences i

I've had on my sister's property. 

She sold the house a couple of years ago. I have just recently met with my sister to ask her more about her old property where all the experiences had happened to see what else she may have experienced besides what she had told me previously. 

I will be getting hold of my niece to get more of her experiences there. I'm finding out more of the experiences and it gets weirder the more I hear! And my niece would use a Ouija board at my sister's house and she said her and her friend would take the board back and forth from my sister's house and her friend's house playing with it! 

I don't think every experience that has happened at my sister's old property had to do with the board."
"The Ghost Nurse I Met That Night","California","Haunted Places","I was 11 years old and it was hours after surgery, I woke up. Of course, I was in pain so I stayed in the hospital for some days. I had a hard time breathing because there was nothing to blow my nose with so I tried to call a nurse. After all, I needed tissues but since it was nighttime there were rarely any people there. 

Suddenly a nurse came in and opened up a small packet of cotton swabs added cream to them and was like ""Hold on, let me help you with that"" while smiling after she rubbed them in my nose, I could breathe better now and she threw the packet in the trash can and said ""there that's better now?"" and when she left the room, it was in a fast but slow pace. 

Then I drifted off to sleep. The next morning I woke up and the small packet was gone from the trash. My assigned nurse was confused when I told her about the nurse who helped me. 

 They asked me ""What did she look like?"" 

 ""Asian with black hair,"" I replied. They were confused because there was no one of that description that night, also they were confused about the cotton swabs, which was odd because the button to call the nurse was only for my assigned nurse. So how would that kind spirit have known about me needing help to breathe? 

Also to mention her presence was really cold even though it wasn't that cold in that room. 

I told many friends and family about this and they were shocked too. One of them says it might've been an angel or a very kind spirit."
"Hypnagogic Hallucinations?","Rhode Island","Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis","I have had many different types of ""visitations"" from my point of view. From dark figures in my bedroom doorway that I couldn't really see no matter how hard I tried, to being picked up off my bed by an unseen person/entity, having someone or something grab my ankles while in bed and try to pull me off, to something sitting on my chest while I could not move or open my eyes and growl and snarl right into my face. Being able to feel the heat of its breath on my face.

 The worst time was when I believe myself to be awake. I was in bed, it was dark, no lights on. My bedroom door opened and I could see a dark shadow. Darker than the area around it, crawling around on the floor. I heard it coming around the bottom of the bed. I could hear it breathing, growling. I was laying on my side at the time facing the door. I felt the bed depress as it climbed up on the bed. I could not move. At this point I was on my side, unable to move and I could feel it on the bed where my back was. I felt it start to press against my back like to was trying to enter me. I was so terrified at that point I passed out from fear. I thought for sure I was going to die.

 A lot of this happened in my mid to late twenties to early thirties. It got so bad I refused to sleep in my room or go in there at all. This mostly happened after my parents purchased the empty lot next to us and were doing construction for a garage. But after I moved, it continued to happen at the new place. I was desperate for answers and reached out to a local paranormal group and informed them of my experiences. They told me that it sounded like Hypnagogic Hallucinations. Rather than continue to be terrified in my own home, I chose to see this as the answer. However, the terror of that night has never left me. I am now 49 years old."
"Restless Spirits","Arkansas","Haunted Places","This happened on the property next to the Crater of Diamonds in Murfreesboro, Arkansas. 

My wife at the time, my two step sons, (one being a big hockey player), and I went to Crater of Diamonds to dig/sift for diamonds. This was in 2002. A big creek separated The Crater of Diamonds and the property we stayed at overnight. 

We stayed overnight on the property next door, which rented tee-pees and one cabin, which the cabin was built on top of posts. We first rented a tee-pee thinking it was pretty cool, which it was, but my wife wasn't crazy about it, so I went to the office to see if the cabin was available, it was. So we moved our stuff into the cabin.

 I'm 6 ft even and I could walk under the cabin with a couple of feet of clearance still above my head. 

There wad no grass under the cabin. It started misting heavy and began a steady light sprinkling. The ground got wet under and around the cabin to where you'd see footprints if you were to walk across the dirt area.

We were in the cabin, just sitting around talking. We had pulled our shoes off before entering the cabin due to the rain and mud. 

I was the only one sitting on the bed. It had only a board nailed to the wall for about a one ft tall headboard. I was leaning against the wall and had my head against the wall. All of a sudden, something hit the wall about two feet above my head. It sounded like a sledgehammer had hit the wall, flat as a pancake, and as hard as you could swing it. 

Now, the floor of the cabin is around 8 ft off the ground, the bed was a couple of feet off of the floor, and from my butt to the top of my head, at least 3 ft. So this wall got hit at least 13 ft off of the ground outside!

As soon as it happened, my step son (the hockey player), and I threw on our shoes and ran down the stairs to the area around and under the cabin. It only took us maybe 30 seconds to get down there after the hit happened. 

We expected to find someone running away, footprints in the mud, or something laying on the ground that may have been thrown.

NOTHING. NO SIGN OF ANYTHING OR ANYONE! Later that night, we heard something outside. My wife and I went outside on the deck with our 35mm camera. The woods were around maybe 50 ft from the cabin. We heard rustling in the woods. We started shooting pictures at random. Only a couple of pictures had orbs. One with maybe 5 or 6 orbs. The other had probably 30 to 40 orbs, no joke. Then, one other picture had no orbs at all, but there was a tracer at the edge of the woods. It appeared to be around 6 to 7 ft long, pink for about half if the length, then fading into purple for the rest of it's length.

The tracer blocked out 2 trees behind it and one tree in front of the tracer blocked out the tracer as it was apparently weaving through the trees. It wasn't visible to the naked eye. It was only in the picture. 

When we got home, we put the pictures on the computer and printed out an orb picture and enlarged it. The orb had multi pastel transparent colors with what seemed to be the shape of a face in the middle of the colors. Couldn't make out the face exactly. 

We told the owner of the property what had happened and he didn't show any emotion or really comment or even apologize for the activity.

Of course, through divorce, my wife got the pictures."
"Things Happening In Numbers Of Five","Texas","Haunted Places","Recouped from my fence jobs here at the lake. Sitting and having early a.m. Coffee... Here we go...!

As my first two published experiences, of things happening in five's, or including something that happened in five's during an unexplained experience, here's my last experience with things happening in five's.

This is three (3) different nights of unexplained experiences, but all three being almost the very same.

I was outside on my sister's property, in Denison,Texas, which is where I was living at the time. 

Besides the main house there is also a guest house out back, which I was living beside in a 30 foot camper. 

She has a bedroom at the very back of the main house that reaches across the whole width of the house. It had a fireplace in it also.

Before my grandfather bought her the house and three acres, one of the prior owners had built a wall down the center of the bedroom width-wise making it into two long skinny rooms.

 It had four big windows, with foil on them, stretching across the whole width of the back of the second room of the old bedroom which was the very back of the house.

The first (1) night, it was some time between midnight and two a.m... I was leaning up against one of the very tall foiled windows, with only my head, looking out at the pasture behind her property (They weren't tweakers!) 

 All of a sudden, I hear what sounds like five footsteps inside the room, I'm outside of, and the footsteps started at the doorway of that long room, and were coming towards the foiled window I was leaning up against outside the house.

After the loud five footsteps starting at the doorway of that room, coming towards me, I knew with about two more steps, it'd be at the window my head was leaning up against outside. I moved away from the window about 15 feet, after the fifth footstep.

That spare room had stuff literally just thrown into it from the doorway by my sister and brother in law. No pathway to walk in there, literally!

Each footstep had the sound of someone stepping down onto the crap on the floor, with the sound of the crap settling to the floor under pressure. All within a single footstep.

 It did five footsteps, until I moved away from the window, each of the five steps sounding as if it were recorded on an old tape recorder. Each had the same identical sounds and volume. Nothing else happened that night. 

The second (2) time, I was outside leaning with my head against a different foiled window outside the same room, the window furthest away from the room's doorway.

 It was several days after the last time, somewhere between midnight and two a.m...

Same thing... Suddenly, starting at the doorway of that room, five same exact footsteps, same exact sounds and volume as the time before like a recording. 

I'm way at the other end of that room, outside, leaning with my head against the fourth foiled window! As before, after the fifth footstep, I now realize it's coming to the window I'm at. I know within a couple more steps, it will be at the window I'm at. So I moved away from the window about 15 ft. Nothing else happened that night. 

To shorten this...

The third night. Same time, place, sounds, and volume. JUST A DIFFERENT WINDOW! No matter what window I was at, it was still five footsteps, same exact sounds, each footstep, each time like a recording.

The fourth (4) night, each of these experiences being 2 to 3 days apart, it was only about 9 p.m. This night, but dark.

I leaned my head against one of the four foiled windows, this time bumping the back of my head loudly several times against the window... NOTHING HAPPENED! Needless to say, I NEVER looked for whatever 

This thing was, EVER again!

 My sister sold the house not long after. And if you read my other two published unexplained experiences, my niece had played with a Ouija board years prior. You really need to read my last two publishings of things happening in numbers of five to get this one. At least the three experiences were in the order I published them. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR READING AND ALL YOUR INPUT! Y'all are great! Also, as you all know, when you have unexplained experiences, no matter how long or short, or how many times you experience things, you NEVER, EVER forget them. Word for word, every happening by happening, during EACH experience. Thanks again!"
"More Haunted Hotel Encounters","New York","Haunted Places","My husband and I and our cat were living in one of the hotel rooms. There's a long metal heating pipe that sticks out of the floor and horizontally stretches across the side wall of the room. Next to where the pipe sticks out, there's a little hole in the floor. When you look down the hole it's pitch black. I'm not sure how deep it is but it's deep enough. My cat was fascinated with it. Everyday she would sit by that hole just staring at it almost every hour. A lot of times her ears would perk up and her eyes would widen and she'd try to put her head down the hole but was never successful at it. Then one day as she was putting her face near the hole she suddenly jumped back and started backing up away from the hole. I ran over and took a flashlight to see what was going on inside it. As I shined the light in the hole I couldn't see anything but darkness. I then started to feel strange vibes in the air. Something really spooked my cat and I've never seen her get that scared before. As I said in my other story, the hotel has a history of being haunted because it used to be an asylum for the criminally insane and the basement uses to be a morgue and a lot of people have died there way back in the day. 

Staff have told me they've seen spirits multiple times there and phantom knocks on doors.

 Guests have reported encounters as well. One of my friends who also lives there told me there's was something in her room. She said her son's mood changed to angry all the time and her daughter was acting out and didn't want to go to school meanwhile her daughter loves school and has never acted out like this before. So basically her children's personalities have negatively changed ever since they moved into that room. My friend also told me that three nights in a row she would have dreams about this horned demon which really freaked her out. She told me she rarely ever has dreams especially dreams three nights in a row and especially a demonic dream. When they finally switched rooms her kids were back to their old selves and she hasn't dreamed of the horned demon since."
"Haunted Hotel Encounters","New York","Haunted Places","My husband and I and our cat live in a hotel. As I mentioned in my other stories, the hotel used be an asylum for the criminally insane and the basement was a morgue way back in the day. Out of all the rooms we lived in there was one room in particular that had the most paranormal activity and it was a negative experience. When we first moved into that room, right away the energy felt off. The atmosphere just felt heavy and depressing. One night my cat, Selene, was following something invisible around the room. She kept trying to climb the wall and kept looking up at the ceiling with her eyes moving frantically in every direction. I could feel how uncomfortable she was by all the energies she was giving off. I tried to pet her to calm her down but she pinned her ears at me and gave me an angry look. Now, Selene is one of the most sweetest cats in the world and extremely friendly with people so by her suddenly acting like this was definitely out of the ordinary. So I backed off and layed down in bed while watching TV and then Selene jumped up on her cat tree which was about a foot away from where I was laying and when I looked over at her she still had her ears pinned and she was literally giving me the death stare looking so angry. She wouldn't stop staring at me. I started getting scared. Every move I made while in bed she looked like she was ready to pounce. I never felt scared of my cat ever until that day. I was so afraid to move so I just layed in bed not moving and hysterically crying. The energies in the room were strong and angry. Finally Selene calmed down and returned to her old self. I hesitated to pet her at first but her energy reassured me that she was ok. I cried with relief when I scooped her up in my arms and held her close. Days later my husband and I were moving to a different room. As my husband was grabbing the last bit of storage from our old room he suddenly sensed negative, eerie energy around him and it freaked him out. My cat and I were already in the new room at the time my husband was in the old room feeling these negative energies. My husband isn't really a firm believer in spirits. He tries to find more logical explanations for things but this time when he admitted to me that he felt those strange energies, something was definitely in that room."
"U F Orange","Idaho","Orbs / Lights / Mists","While investigating and contacting many on my Stick Indian encounter, and talking to UFO Washington, I shared my only UFO sighting with him. He assured me the military will not bother people anymore for reporting them so after five years now I will share my only UFO sighting. I told the man who bought my home what I had seen and to look up in the early hours. He is the only one I told. 

Five years or so ago I was awakened by a very loud constant banging. I quickly get downstairs to go find the problem, at the bottom of stairs 10 feet away is the front door and I feel noise is coming from front of house. It is very early, and I am only in my briefs, so I do not turn the porch light on. There is a 6 feet wide deck above me at 10 feet high. It is very windy, and the banging is coming from my left as a new home is being built over the hillside and somebody installed a door with no doorknob, and it is BANG BANG Banging in the wind.

The city lights are below my home and the airplane lane is out in front of our road. It is kind of pastureland down in front of us, and down maybe 30 feet from my feet on the porch to valley floor. As I scan left to right over this part of Boise, I am looking straight ahead now over my neighbor's new home and above and to the right of his roof is a huge craft of some kind sitting in the sky, in the airplane lane.

 This craft is glowing an orange light. My mind showed me two school busses end to end and as tall as a bus. So this orange glowing window is 10 or 12 feet tall and 60 to 80 feet long and it is sitting in the sky at a 2:00 o'clock and 8:00 o'clock angle. There is no way to even walk in this craft at that angle. The 2:00 o'clock is pointed right at the Boise airport tower like it is showing bottom of craft towards the airport and the bottom 8:00 o'clock is at my end. This bad boy is blocking stars behind it, and I cannot tell the shape of the craft just the amazing bright orange strip that is glowing. I run to the dining room window 30 feet away to get my binoculars and return, only to find it is gone. I believe I studied it for about 12 seconds before running for binoculars. I think I caught it as it was preparing to take off hence the strange angle in the sky.

 If your hand is pointing straight down was 6:00 o'clock and point your hand straight over your head and that is 12:00 o'clock this craft's low end is at 8:00 o'clock angle it would be 10:30 in the sky and high point 2:00 o'clock pointed at airport would be 10:45 in the night sky and that is very low. I guesstimate it was less than 400 feet from the ground and less than a 1/4 mile away. Guessing only in the darkness but still huge in the night sky. The orange light could only be seen by maybe four homes positioned just above neighbors and only golf course past our street. Very Strategically planned hiding spot. 

 No jets sent after this craft, Airforce below and next to airport and we were close enough to hear Reveille morning and night. Did I witness a Space force craft? Were little green men probing my neighbors? Better them than me. So many questions and I do not want to see it again.

 I wanted to add I am 100 percent sure my visitation was not Stick Indians related and I will update that story when I learn more."
"Black Hooded Shadow Figure And Two Black Cloaked People","Oklahoma","Non Human Entities","On two separate occasions, I have recently seen things. The first thing I saw was on the street around the corner from my street. I was driving and stopped at the stop sign. I looked to the left. Right there on the road but to the side was a shadow like figure. It looked like a stick figure with a hooded t-shirt on. It was wierd. It was kind of like a scarecrow but it was black. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. My mind thought a kid at the bus stop because it was almost 8 am. I went through the intersection but stopped and looked back at it to try and make out what I was seeing. It was still and not moving. It's arms were thin and black as it's shirt. It didn't have hands. No face, just a head that was black with the hood shape. I started to drive off but I stopped again and tried to make out the legs which looked like black sticks or somewhat holographic or something. That was about a month ago. 

 Then, just a couple of days ago I went to the store at dusk and it had just gotten dark when I left the store. There's a stop light in the middle of town. At the stop light the fire truck went east across the next block. I turned left which is west. I go two blocks and turn right, I'm going back north and at the first stop sign, across the road, right there maybe about 10ft from the corner, on the side of the road but in the road, were two people dressed in black cloaks that touch the ground. For some reason my car lights weren't doing me any justice. It was like my lights were only shining on the bottom half of them. I tried to drive slow around them to get a good look but they had pale faces that looked shaped like the ""I know what you did last summer"" mask but it was different and scary and I sped around them. I kept thinking maybe kids/teenagers pranking or something but it's not Halloween. They weren't walking just standing there, looking around, like they didn't know where they were or waiting. The reason I mention the fire truck is because the fire station is just a block down from where they were.

 I'd like to know what these things were and why I'm seeing them."
"I Think I Saw My Father's Doppelgänger","Virginia","Non Human Entities","My name is Deasia, I'm 15 but I was 14 when this happened in January or February of 2023. I know I wasn't hallucinating or having delusions, I was sitting on the couch it was around 10 or 11 pm. All my family members have gone to sleep and I'm always the last one to fall asleep in the house. I remember I was watching a true crime YouTube video as I am into true crime. I was also texting my friends and my boyfriend at the time. And then I saw my father walking down the hall.

 I was thinking to myself. ""Why is my father up? He falls asleep early as he wakes up for work at 4 am."" I was calling my father's name and he wasn't answering at all, and I thought that's weird my father always answers me. I then saw him walk into the kitchen. I then got up to ask him why he was up, but when I walked into the kitchen he was gone. I was like what the actual F**K, I don't remember my father walking out of the kitchen at ALL. I was even questioning my sanity, but I then walked down the hall to see if my father was actually awake but he wasn't he was in a deep sleep. And things even got weirder and I was like nope I AM not sleeping tonight. I then told one of my friends about the situation that just happened. She tried to say it was a Skinwalker. But I said wouldn't they eat me? I stayed up until my father woke up for work. I told him the story and he believed but my siblings and my mother didn't since they don't believe in ghosts. Hopefully, I don't see that being or thing I thought was my father ever again..."
"Haunted Historic Mansion In Akron","Ohio","Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels","Last year in 2023, when a lot of the pandemic restrictions were lifted, my two friends, and I went to the beautiful Hower House in Akron, Ohio that sits not too far from Akron University with a Sorority house nearby. 

I feel I should supply you with some significant background (I know, I know. Here she goes with another history lesson!). However, I feel this background may supply some possible insight as to the nature of the hauntings. Not only in the house, but, allegedly on the property itself.

Before the house was even built it was all Indian land. Lets face it. Indians were the indigenous people before the Settlers moved in. Thus, there may be some possible paranormal fodder for thought associated with that fact also.

John Henry Hower moved to Akron from Doylestown, Ohio in 1865 with his wife Susan Youngker Hower. They had three sons. The house, actually a mansion, was constructed in 1871, and consists of 28 rooms that the Hower family filled to capacity with lovely, and exotic souvenirs/artifacts from all over the world (If I had their money-I'd burn mine.). Well traveled family. John was a Miller/Reaper who processed grain turning it into cereal. A lot of cereal. Enough cereal that it made him extremely wealthy. He became known as 'The Father of Akron Industry'. With that vast wealth he needed a dwelling in keeping with his status in the community. A very grand dwelling, indeed.

The building is a Victorian mansion constructed in the Second Empire Italianate style. It is gorgeous-forgive me, but I love those kinds of houses. I would never want to live in one. Too much upkeep. Alright to visit them though.

John's first wife, Susan, died of one of the many fatal illnesses/diseases that were prevalent during those years. However, Susan made John promise that he'd never marry again. A rather unreasonable request I think. He got lonely and remarried 4 years later to his second wife, Rebecca. I mention this little tidbit for a specific reason, so bear with me, please.

The mansion required a lot of servants therefore requiring that a structure be built to house them. The Servant's quarters were a separate building nearby. The former servant's quarters were, much later, turned into a sorority house, but more on that later.

John Hower's second son, Milton Otis Hower, moved in with his wife and two children, Grace, and John, many years later.

 In 1900 John wrote a letter to his son describing some unusual happenings, such as floating lights, that were appearing in the house that his mother witnessed. However, they didn't feel threatened by the events. The Hower family lived in the mansion for 100 years until the last matriarch of the family, Grace, passed on and willed the entire estate to the University of Akron in 1973. It was turned into a museum, and has been operated in that capacity since the 1980's. Here, my friends, is where it gets really interesting.

The University of Akron would send two female students from the nearby sorority house to live and work in the museum for a year, or two. The two young women would get room and board while working there, as well as keeping an eye on the place after tours closed. However, before I continue I would like to contribute the fact that this house and it's paranormal history has been documented long before this post I submit here. One of the stories written about it was in a book on Ohio's paranormal events titled 'It Came from Ohio' written in 2012 by James Renner, a paranormal researcher and writer. He would go to allegedly haunted locations, interview witnesses, and try to gather his own first-hand information. Ohio's haunted history goes all the way back to the Revolutionary War. Just supplying some facts in the event any of you may be interested. You may be surprised what has gone on in good old Ohio.

Now, to continue. Mr. Renner interviewed one of the two young women that were staying in the mansion around the late 90's. The young woman he interviewed, Ashley, started working/living at the mansion in 1998 and stayed for two years. She told him that she never believed the ghost stories associated with the place until-as usual-she had her own experiences. She claimed that she would hear persistent knocking on the inside of her closet door every night. It spooked her. She learned that a century ago, a housekeeper would lock her children in that closet to punish them. One of the children, a boy, had a hammer and would pound on the inside of the door pleading to be let out. The reason for the knocking she surmised. After she learned that she slept with the closet door open. Also, her and another roommate would sit up some nights listening to someone downstairs playing the piano. They called the police. Before the officer entered the house he called on the radio for back-up, and to bring their Proton Packs. He informed Ashley that it was not the first time that the police were called to that house for such disturbances as that and many others that go back for decades.

 One night she had her boyfriend over. They were sitting in her room and her boyfriend was facing the door when she noticed that his face froze while she was talking to him. He was staring at the open door. She looked up and they BOTH saw an elderly woman walk by in something like a long nightgown trailing behind her. Yet they heard absolutely no footsteps. The woman they saw matched the portrait in the hallway of the last matriarch of the family, Grace. Somehow she was out of the portrait and walking about the house. Ashley called her friend who worked there before her. Her friend told her that Grace didn't like men in the house. That's why they always took in female caretakers to stay there. It came to a head when, one night, this ghost attacked her boyfriend. He woke her up one night covered in sweat and white as a sheet. He told her that the bed sheets were yanked up around his neck so tight as to begin choking him while he heard a female voice whispering something horrible in his ear. Ashley left shortly after that, and another young women took her place. Thus adding to the long line of witnesses to the activity in the house.

 The last event that took place was when a school security guard responded to check out a disturbance late one night. He removed his shoes so as not to soil the lovely carpeting in the entrance way. While he was inspecting the floors he clearly heard a female voice sternly say ""Get out of my house"". He was so scared that he left without his shoes. Some have theorized that the ghost may be that of Susan Hower, the first wife of John, upset by a broken vow to never remarry. Therefore taking offense to all men who enter her home.

Now that I've laid a fairly respectable foundation, on to my personal encounter with my friends, while we were touring that astounding mansion. We wanted to take a self-guided tour, but, guess what? You have to be accompanied by a female student Monitor. She was very nice, and apologetic about having to go with us, and my friends were a bit put off by this. I took them aside and explained to them that, possibly, some less than honest tourists may have come through and stolen some of the many beautiful antique artifacts during some past tours. Therefore making it necessary to have a monitor come along to prevent any further thefts. After all she didn't know us personally. Let alone know how honest we were. We accepted it on those grounds and let her follow us around. She would gladly answer any questions that we asked of her in regards to the house.

 I was in Victorian Paradise just gawking at all the fantastic antique furnishings, dishes, China, jewelry, Ivory carvings, candelabras, family portraits, Tiffany lamps, crystal lighting fixtures and personal items of the family. Right on!

We gravitated to the second floor to enjoy the other lovely rooms and what have you. While we were standing in the hallway admiring a gorgeous Walnut Parlor table with delicate lamps, and picture frames, outside of a room with a closed door. We all heard some rather noticeable and loud knocking inside that room. We questioned the monitor, but she just said that the room is always locked and nothing is in there. We countered with the fact that there was loud knocking in there so someone has to be in that room, but she just went pale, and said she didn't possess a key to enter it, and seemed somewhat shaken. We realized that she was spooked at this point and let it drop.

It was a bit spooky, but did not detract from our enjoyment of touring that wonderful place. However, just before we left for the day I sent a mental request to whatever, or whomever, that we enjoyed the house, and told it to continue to stay in it's beautiful house, and be happy, and not to follow us home. I thanked it for letting us see their beautiful home, and wished it well. Might sound silly, but I don't like to take chances. 

There have been other accounts of visitors encountering what they thought were Indians outside roaming the outer perimeter of the grounds, but I, personally, cannot confirm, or deny those claims. The Hower House in Akron is well worth the cost of admission. Even without the spirits. I apologize for this lengthy narrative, but I had a lot to impart to you. Again, I thank you for being tenacious enough to read this account!"
"Did Something Followed Me?","Texas","A Haunted Life","If you read about my prior published true unexplained experience (sorry, kind of lengthy), but that experience was back to back for about an hour and half, which I had experienced. 

Long story short, things started happening in numbers of ""five"". I think something may have followed me to my dad's house in town. 

He had gone to town. I stayed behind that day and started doing house work to help him since my step mom had passed away the year before.

I was in the hallway vacuuming. At the end of the hall were four doors. One to the restroom, and three to the three bedrooms. All were shut good for sure. I had just been in them cleaning prior to vacuuming the hallway. 

The vacuuming in the hallway was very loud. Behind me about five feet was my step mom's old room where she passed away a year prior to this.

All of a sudden, with my back to her old room, it seemed like time stood still. Then the sound of her door slamming shut ""five"" times real fast happened!

It seemed as if the ""five"" slams lasted a couple of seconds, but it HAD to be longer than that because I actually had time to count the slams!

 It happened so fast that I couldn't physically turn around fast enough to see the door while it was happening.

I got chill bumps, major. And said ""What the hel*""! I went outside until my dad got back home! 

I wonder if something followed me to my dad's in town from my sister's property just outside the edge of town?

 Has anyone else had things happen in certain numbers? And what could have followed me, if anything? I'm not sure but prior and after this activity, more things happened in ""five's""."
"Very Unexplained Experiences","Texas","Haunted Places","My sister had a property on Des Voignes Road in Denison, Tx. It was recently sold. I had visited her for years, and had even lived there twice. Nothing ""unexplained"" ever happened until my second time living there. This time, my wife and I lived in a thirty foot camper, under a metal rv cover, beside the guest house, out behind the main house. I don't know what changed, but for that year and a half of living on her property, I had many ""unexplained"" experiences happen.

 One of my experiences lasted around one and a half to two hours. It was around 1:00 p.m., in August of 2020, 104 degrees, and not a cloud in the sky. I was in the rear of the camper which was the bedroom. All of a sudden, I heard voices of what sounded like about seven or eight people coming from the other side of the guest house from where my camper sat, and the voices came around the rear of the guest house and up to my rear camper door talking the entire time, all of them at once, but not understanding one word they were saying. As soon as the voices reached the back door, all of the voices stopped. The rear door doorknob sounded as if it turned, but didn't ever release. The doorknob never physically moved. I was looking right at it the whole time. The door never opened. All of a sudden, the voices started talking again, all at once. Instead of just going directly through the small piece of privacy fence which was blocking a physical person from going from the front door to the rear door on that same side of the camper, the voices, talking continuously, as they went quickly around the camper to the front door, same side of the camper they were just at, all of the voices stopped talking all at once. The sound of the front door doorknob began ""jiggling"" vigorously immediately back and forth, but never physically moved. I was looking right at the doorknob the whole time. The door never opened.

 As I was going from the rear to the front of the camper following the voices, I grabbed my Glock 9mm. Immediately after the vigorous back and forth ""jiggling"" noise of the front door doorknob stopped, which lasted a few seconds, I opened the camper door, Glock in hand, and no one was physically there. I ran outside circling the entire property. No one was there. I went back inside the camper and started going over in my head what all had just happened!

 I sat there around fifteen minutes and then I heard something outside towards the front of the camper. I went outside and found myself standing in the opening of the yard. All of a sudden, I felt like I was the only physical person on earth. The wind picked up immediately, then stopped and came to a dead quiet just as quickly as it had began. Being close to town, just outside city limits, you could still hear train horns and police and fire sirens from there. During sirens, day or night, you'd only ever hear about two dogs within hearing distance howling. Suddenly in one direction, directly in front of me, it sounded like fifteen to twenty dogs started barking all at once, and kept barking continuously. Within what seemed like about thirty seconds, the sounds of fifteen to twenty dogs started barking directly behind me with the barking still continuous in front of me also.

In what seemed to be around thirty seconds, barking of fifteen to twenty dogs started barking directly to my left. Now what sounded to be around 45 to 60 dogs were barking continuously from 3 even directions around me. In what felt like around thirty seconds again, now the sounds of another fifteen to twenty dogs started barking from directly to my right. Now, what sounded like 60 to 80 dogs barking continuously from four totally even directions around me was happening. From the other three directions, the barking never stopped from the beginning of all of this experience. As soon as the barking started in the fourth direction, all of the barking stopped after what seemed to be just a few seconds. During all of this activity, it seemed that I was the only physical person on earth, and felt like time stood still.

 My sister had been home so I went directly into the main house to tell her all of what had just happened! I had to stop at the restroom first. It was on the opposite side of the main house from where all of the activities had just happened. The restroom had a window with a pink curtain. You could see silhouettes through the curtain but not full detail. All of a sudden, I heard sounds of feet running, coming around the house from where all the activities had just happened, coming towards the bathroom window. The voice loudly said, "" He's inside"" as it sounded like it was running around the main house towards the restroom window. No one ever passed the window. Within less than one minute, I looked through the curtain, not opening it, saw a light, brighter than daylight, dancing with a wavy, back and forth motion. Remember, it's mid day and not a cloud in the sky, and 104 degrees. The light began next door from the other side of their property at their driveway. Dancing across that property, getting bigger as it danced in it's motion as it got closer. It started out about softball size, and when it got to the edge of my sister's property fence line, which is where it stopped, it was about basketball size. I immediately leaned to the side of the window. In a few seconds, I leaned back in front of the window. The light, bright as the sun, was gone.

 I opened the pink kind of see-through curtain. I looked over to the other side of the next door property, at their driveway to where the light began. Right exactly where the light had began, stood what they portray aliens on TV to look like. It was around 6 to 7 feet tall, skinny, long neck, and medium tan in color. It was a solid, even, color. Only the outline shape and color inside. No detail features such as ears, eyes, or nose. As soon as I saw it, not scared, but ""dumbly"" letting the curtain go instead of watching it. I leaned over away from in front of the window. Within just a couple of seconds, I moved the curtain and looked out and it was gone.

 I went to the front of the house to tell my sister, who was sitting in the living room, what all had just happened. My niece had just moved out of my sister's house. She had two tall windows in her room, and had left a dresser in between the two windows and a mattress on the floor under one of the windows when she moved. The door to her old bedroom was in the living room next to where my sisters recliner sat. I started telling my sister about the activities. All of a sudden, I hear voices coming from my niece's old room. Then the voices stopped. I went into the bedroom which my niece had just moved out of, only a couple of feet. Then I heard a loud voice start talking outside, not understanding a single word it said.

 There was a dresser against the wall in between the two windows. I laid down on the mattress, under the window, ear to the wall. Also, it was a brick house. The windows being high windows. All of a sudden, I hear a loud voice down by my ear nearly at floor level, coming from outside. It sounded as if someone was shouting something to someone next door. Of course loudly, but not understanding a single word. I couldn't see the other window due to the dresser in between the two windows. I'm on the floor sitting on the old mattress. At the other window I can't see, starts the sound of like an old house window, with the window being almost painted shut. Like you'd have to raise the window but it wouldn't raise all of the way due to the build up of paint so you'd put the window down, then raising it a little harder each time until it raises all the way. It did the up and down sound four times. At this time, being very tall windows, even though all of the unexplained activities had been happening back to back around an hour now, I'm thinking this time it really sounds like something physical happening. So after the sound of the window going up and down for four times now, I'm thinking someone has to be on a step stool outside due to the tall windows. So I'm thinking they're about to get the window open and possibly fall into the house on their head. So I get up off the mattress, which is on the floor and I look around the dresser to see if they have a weapon in hand. Basically to see if I need to run or fight! I look around the dresser, straight at the window. No one there, but the sound of the window going up and down a fifth time happened while I was staring at it. Then the sound of that stopped. The window never physically moved. I was approximately 2 to 3 feet from it max when the fifth time it sounded like the window went up and down happened.

 That was all that happened that day that was unexplainable. There is more about the sound of the window going up and down five times. It will actually tie to some of my other unexplained experiences I had during the last year and a half of living on my sister's property. The window sound of ""up and down"" five times has to do with some of my other unexplained experiences happening by/in 5's."
"Multiple Haunting Experiences Almost Everyday","New York","Haunted Places","Long Beach Hotel, Long Beach, NY

9:40 pm

My husband and I and our cat are residents at the Long Beach Hotel. One day my cat and I heard a knock on my door in room 325. I called out ""who is it?"" but nobody answered. I walked towards the door and saw no shadow underneath the door, heard no footsteps, and no voices. Everything was silent. I opened the door and nobody was there at all. My husband was out at the time so it wasn't him either. All of my recent spiritual encounters happens here at the hotel. The Long Beach Hotel is very old. A very long time ago, before it was a hotel, it used to be an asylum for the criminally insane and the basement of the hotel was literally a morgue. A lot of people died here. 

Another time in room 325 my AC remote was somewhere under my blankets in my bed. I stripped the entire bed right down to the mattress cover but the remote was nowhere to be found. I walked to the opposite side of the room for a minute and when I walked back to the bed, the remote was sitting right on the edge of the bed out of nowhere. I believe this was a harmless, mischievous poltergeist. 

One time I walked out of my room to go outside for a smoke and I decided to leave my lamp on. When I came back the lamp was off. I thought maybe the bulb burnt out but then I noticed the lamp key was on the off position so when I turned the key the lamp turned back on. Nobody was in my room when I left. My husband was out. I always leave a lamp on before I go out. 

One night I had my bathroom window a little less than half way open before I shut it for the night. The next morning I went into the bathroom and found the window open in the same position I had it the night before. The EXACT same position. I asked my husband if he opened it and he said he didn't. I knew it wasn't him trying to scare me or play a stupid joke on me anyway because he knows how much I believe in spirits and how I take it seriously and he'd never disrespects my beliefs."
"My Dad's Story","Connecticut","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","As a little girl growing up in the 1970s, I had a pet guinea pig. My two sisters and I each had our own guinea pigs and we loved these little guys. Mine, unfortunately, got sick and passed away. I was devastated. My Dad got a shoe box, which we decorated, and placed the deceased guinea pig in. Dad even made a little cross for the grave and we staged a little funeral in our backyard. After the funeral, I stood there alone staring at the new grave with tears rolling down my cheeks. All of the sudden, something popped up out of the ground where the guinea pig was buried and ran towards the woods before vanishing before my eyes. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. 

It was in the shape of my guinea pig and while part appeared solid, another part of it was transparent. It almost looked gelatinous, if that makes sense. A small sprout, near the makeshift grave, actually moved as this 'shape' moved by it. I knew what I had seen. My heart beat fast as I stood there, unsure what to do. I grew up in a Catholic household and we were taught that animals don't have souls. I knew that wasn't true based on this experience (and others that were to come later on in life). 

The first person I told was my younger sister who told me to stop lying. I remember trying hard to convince her through my tears that this had really happened. We are both in our 50s now and to this day, I don't think she still believes this. 

Later on that day, my Dad was out front mowing the lawn. When he saw me crying, he shut the mower off and came over to me to see how I was doing. I relayed what had happened to him with some reluctance. Much to my surprise, he believed me. 

He relayed the following story to me.

 As a young boy growing up in southern Connecticut (we lived in Massachusetts at the time), he and his older brother were camping in a makeshift tent in the backyard of my grandparent's home during the summer. This happened in the 1950s. The house was built on a hill and was the only one in the area for quite some time. My grandfather built the house with the garage built facing the backyard. When more houses went in, the street was placed to the other side of the house so it was an odd spot for a garage door. The point of these details is to describe how rural the area was at the time. 

As my Dad and Uncle slept in this tent, which was most likely a large blanket draped over rope, my Dad said a bright light appeared outside. He woke up, rubbed his eyes, and then peered outside. There stood a very old man in robes, with a long white beard, and holding a staff. The light he saw from inside the tent was actually emanating from this entity. My Dad said he was frozen in fear. The man just stood there watching him. He didn't speak or make a sound. When Dad finally got the courage, he scrambled back into his bed. He tried to wake my Uncle up but to no avail. He burrowed under the covers and closed his eyes, willing the apparition to leave.

In the morning he told my Uncle what had happened, as well as his parents, and of course, no one believed him! To this day, he swears this happened and I believe him. What is interesting to me is wondering what the entity wanted or what it's purpose was. Was it a guardian of some sort? What throws me is the robes and the staff. Almost sounds biblical and not something historically seen in what was once a rural area of Connecticut. 

My Dad is now in his late 70s and has only been given a few more months to live, due to cancer and an advanced stage of Parkinson's disease. I like to think that this spirit is a guardian, or maybe an angel, that will help him over to the other side when that time comes."
"Sounds During Solar Eclipse","Maine","Haunted Places","I am unsure if this ties into anything from my last bit I posted. But it's currently 3:13 as I write this, and it's during the Solar Eclipse, and I'm hearing stuff. Way more than usual in the house, and it's not even coming from in the house. I keep hearing knocking on my doors, and no one is here. Just random knocking on my doors. I was outside earlier and I could hear whistling while I was out gathering firewood from one of the trees that came down during the last snow storm we had so that it could dry out after being stacked up. I dropped that and left it there and came back inside because our property is PRIVATE PROPERTY. We have a literal wall built around our property line in the woods and no one really walks out back there besides us. 

So, whistling while I was in the woods gathering up wood from one of the recently felled trees, and now I got knocking on my doors that will not stop. I'm more annoyed than scared. It's literally daytime, eclipse or not, I don't like this. Granted, this isn't the first time I've heard whistling from the woods while I've been in there but usually it sounds really far away so I shrug it off and finish what I'm doing before leaving. This time it sounded real close, like maybe within 20 feet kind of close. 

And before anyone makes a comment, I live like 3 HOURS away from the Appalachian trail, it's not a ""flesh pedestrian"" or at least I seriously HOPE it's not. Currently 3:24pm as I'm writing this bit, so I think I'll skip going outside to watch the eclipse and just... Pull up a live feed offline and avoid opening the doors for whatever is knocking on them."
"Wth Case Files 2","Illinois","Haunted Places","A bit of background; I live in an old Victorian house, circa 1875. Obviously, being over a century old a good many have lived and died here.

I would not go as far as to say it's haunted, but we do seem to get quite a few otherworldly visitors; random spirits passing through, the occasional relative stopping by to say 'hi'. But far and away are what I call the WTH files. Those happenings that leave you scratching your head, and feeling very perplexed as to the why and how of it. We seem to get those quite often both in my apartment and the downstairs apartment, and occasionally the basement.

WTH files, though very strange and sometimes unnerving generally are not 'story' length. But, I've taken to compiling them, because simply put, someone else might have an explanation, or, if they've had a similar experience will know it's not just them.

Not really a WTH File but an actual sighting

I was having a lie down. One of my guilty pleasures. Not sleeping, just allowing myself to drift within my own thoughts. When that tingling, as if I'd walked through a spiderweb started and the most intense feeling of being stared at engulfed me. My eyes snapped open, and squatted by my bed so that his face was even with mine, was a man! My guess is he was 25 or so years old. He wore a blue fisherman's weave sweater, and one of those 'newsboy' caps. He was Caucasian with a ruddy complexion, and blondish hair. I don't remember the color of his eyes, except they were kind, and looked a bit confused at seeing me. In a very British accent he asked me, ""May I help you, Mum?"" And just that quick was gone.

 Except for being initially startled by him, I didn't feel threatened or anything bad. But I have wondered, if maybe on another plane of existence he was confused at finding me in HIS bed? I mean, could you imagine? There you are, say stowing stuff under your bed and as you start to get up, there's someone unknown in your bed? Not sure I would have been as polite as he was...

Now for some WTH moments:

In the kitchen

I have the usual double basin kitchen sink, and one day I found half of a tiny dress shirt button sitting on the dividing space. It's the sort one would call a collar button, but only half. I don't own any dress shirts with buttons like that, and I certainly wouldn't have left it on the sink.

Perhaps a week later, I was smelling something 'funky' in the kitchen. A kind of cloying sweet smell. I finally tracked it to the cabinet above the stove. I pulled over my stepstool and climbed up, as I can barely reach the lower shelf. Given that, I don't really keep anything in that cabinet but often used spices on the lowest shelf. On the second shelf, right in the middle, was a puddle of what I can only describe as black goo. It was sticky, and reminded me of thick molasses in texture. Only I haven't had molasses in years. Important: it was the ONLY thing on that shelf, and the shelf above that is empty. I didn't see any signs of drippage, like from the ceiling, or on the cabinet walls so not a leak or mold of some kind. Except for this black goo the unit was clean. Absolutely no idea...

 The Living Room

The appearance of a hollow yellow plastic ball for cats. About Ping-Pong ball size. Just showed up one day. The fact that it moves around from room to room, I'm blaming on my cat. And before any of you think ""well, there you go. Cat brought it in,"" Kirb is a strictly indoors cat. He's old and has no interest in even going down stairs to sit on the porch with me. 

A flowery scent like Jasmine, that lasts only a moment or two.

The smell of cherry pipe tobacco. This one lasts longer - sometimes five minutes or a bit more, others just a whiff or two. 

The rearranging of my books. I have a stack of 18 or so books whose covers I designed for various authors, and I keep waffling between displaying them and just shelving them. In the meantime they just sit in a stack on the end table. Every now and then, the book on top changes. Interestingly enough, books on shelves seem to be left alone. 

 I figure as long as I'm not feeling threatened, the random visits and oddness is okay. Just reminders there's more to life than this life."
"Historic Haunt","Ohio","Haunted Places","Way back in 1972, I was involved in a Summer Co-ed Work/Job Training Program that was set up through the High School, Willoughby South High, that I attended. I secured a position at the historic Garfield Home Museum in Mentor, Ohio, as a tour guide.

I had been to that museum a couple times growing up, but I was thrilled to actually be working there showing visitors through that lovely home. It was purchased in 1876 as a home/farm by James A. Garfield, before he became the 20th President of the United States. It housed himself, his wife, Lucretia, his mother, Eliza Ballou, and 5 of their 7 children. 2 died very young. Medicine wasn't what is it now, and there were many infant fatalities at that time period. Garfield needed a good sized abode for his large family. When he became president-elect in 1880 he gave a speech on the front porch of that very house known as the 'front porch speech'. The reporters called his residence by the name of Lawnfield. He had served in the Civil War prior to that, and was the second president in history to be assassinated after Lincoln. He was shot by Charles Giteau, a disgruntled lawyer, and writer who believed that he had helped Garfield win the election, and felt that he deserved a consulship. He shot Garfield on Sept. 19th, 1881 at a railroad station. He shot him twice. Once in the arm, and once in the lumbar spine.

By today's medical standards, the wounds were non life-threatening. However, the doctors back then did not practice the sterile procedures that are commonplace in todays society. He, more, or less, died of the infections obtained after the bullet was removed due to unsanitary conditions that existed back at that time.

The house is Early American with some Victorian accents that give it an enthralling quaintness and charm. There are gingerbread accents here and there. 

Personally, I loved the architecture. I was always attracted to Early American, Italianate, or Victorian structures. I always thought houses like that had such personality. Now that I have supplied the background on the house/museum, on to the narrative.

I worked there for a little over 2 months after which I had to go on a vacation with my family to California to visit relatives. I met the secretary, her name was Becky, and the Curator of the museum, Mrs.-I forget her name. I was introduced to the other kids I'd be working with. We were all from area High Schools. We were aged 16-17. Two other girls were from Mentor High and one boy was from my rival school, Eastlake North. However, we weren't at a football game, and there was no rivalry there.

 We all, immediately, clicked. We were given some pamphlets to study and memorize to be efficient tour guides. We had so much fun together. We girls would roam into the back store room and ogle over the beautiful gowns that were worn by Mrs. Garfield. Satins, silks, velvets, and for Summer wear, cotton dresses. 

The one boy, Tom would join in with us exploring. He told us that when we were first together, that he felt outnumbered, but after he told his buddies that he worked with three pretty girls, that his friends were jealous of him. After he told us that, we sort of fawned over him a bit. We also got to enter all the rooms that were roped off to the public when the janitor had to unlock the gates to go inside. We were actually TOUCHING pieces of HISTORY. We got such a kick out of it. 

There was the entry way into the office/gift shop that was under a stairwell that went overhead to the 2nd floor. On the 1st floor there were three bedrooms, a parlor, off of the parlor was the living room near the front of the house, and the dining room on the side of the parlor. In the parlor near a landing with steps going up to the 2nd floor was a very large brass dinner bell hanging from a heavy rope. Mrs. Garfield, or the cook, would take a long broom handle and wring that bell for the farm-hands, and family to know when it's time to eat. We were required to give the broom handle to the children of families touring through, so the kids could bang on the bell, and bang, bang, bang they did. It was akin to listening to a gong. Ouch!

Once you mounted the landing to the stairs they ascended to the 2nd floor that contained a large parlor/library full of bookcases/books and the most beautiful antique furnishings. Wow! The upstairs contained 4 more bedrooms, also. Along the walls were glass display cases with all sorts of items from the period. Some of them from the family, and some donated by museum committee members. There was a very large glass display case around the corner from the smaller ones that housed a large, tall case containing mannequins wearing the dress, suit, and shoes of the president and his wife. He was enormous. A little over 6 feet tall, and his wife was 5 foot nothing with a 20 inch waistline. Yipes! Talk about Mutt and Jeff. His shoes were size 14. Gun boats. We all mused over that. Across from that was another display case with medals, and various items from the civil war against a railing that led around the corner to Garfield's private study. His study contained a highly unusual chair that was designed just for him. It had an arm on the left side, and a lowered arm on the right side because he liked to hang his leg over the side of the chair when he read. He had it designed for his personal comfort. Before the study, however, was another set of stairs that led up to a 3rd floor. They were, originally, more sleeping space for his children, but the museum turned it into another sort of museum for the Lake County Historical Society.

 There was an antique pump organ with stops that you had to pull out to change the tones, or keys. We would play with it. One of us would be at the bottom of the stairs and invite the customers to go upstairs to peruse the artifacts. Before we sent them up we told them that it was haunted. Meanwhile, the three others were up there with two on the floor pumping the bellows while the last one played eerie music on the organ. Four teenagers (look out world.). The customers got a kick out of it, and we got some pretty good tips as well.

Across from the president's study was the last stairwell that we'd unlock so the visitors could descend to the 1st floor and the gift shop, lol! We had to behave ourselves when the curator was around, but when she wasn't we went back to normal. Don't misunderstand. We knew the material and were very good tour guides, but we were kids, too.

The 3rd floor upstairs museum is where something happened that rather scared the bejeebers out of me and another girl. I'll call her Amy.

I imagine that when we were goofing around with that pump organ and telling people ghost stories that someone, or something took offense to our shenanigans, and set out to teach US a lesson.

Amy and I were on a break. We went up there just to look around at the antique toys, instruments and furniture. We were just gawking around when an old wooden play riding horse with wheels for, possibly, a toddler, rolled from around the corner, completely unassisted, toward us. Amy let out a soft 'eek'. I was startled, but began trying to rationalize. I told her that the floor must be uneven, or slanted, and that's why it rolled on it's own. Maybe the vibration of our walking caused it. However, Amy was right there with a snappy, and logical, comeback. She pointed out that it came from AROUND THE CORNER. So much for my rationale. That went out the window, and we beat a hasty retreat. We didn't mention it to the other two tour guides for fear they'd think we were smoking something that we shouldn't have been, or just being dramatic.

A few weeks after that incident, I had just finished giving a tour to a couple College guys (cute ones too!), and was about to follow them downstairs when out of my periphery I thought I saw a large man sitting in Garfield's special chair in his study reading a book. Of course, I did a double-take. There was a man sitting there reading. I was about to ask him how he got in there when, poof, he just disappeared in front of me. I had to stifle a shriek. Naturally, I flew down the stairs and fetched Amy to bring her up with me to the study. I told her what I saw. She was curious. Especially after what happened to us on the 3rd floor. She didn't doubt me, but she wanted to see the study with me. There was a small table next to the chair that contained a humidor and nothing more. However, sitting on that small table was, in fact, a book that wasn't there before. Amy asked me if I was in the room, and grabbed the book. I answered that I would never climb over a locked metal gate. In a mini-skirt no less. No way did I go in there. She turned a bit pale. I was, too. I may have actually seen the former president. That's probably as close to seeing a president as I'll ever get. He looked very solid. I didn't detect his ethereal nature until he vanished. 

That didn't frighten us away however. If anything, it intrigued us. It also made working there far more interesting knowing that the former family members still had something of a foothold in their former home. Maybe, they even enjoyed the tours that we gave to the visitors from all over the world. I like to think that we did them justice in the long run.

I lost touch with the other kids after that, but it was a very enjoyable time for me. It was before I got married to my 1st husband. I still had a year to go before graduating. 

The Lake County Historical Society no longer operates the Garfield Home. The State operates it now. It's not quite as enjoyable to tour it now as it was back then, but those are the breaks. I wonder what the ghosts think about it. I think they LIKED the way WE did the tours way back then, lol! Thanks for reading!"
"Linkwood House","Delaware","Haunted Places","I would love to share the several stories I have! I have been trying to tell others my stories my entire life and have gotten looked at like I was nuts. 

My stories go back to before I was even born, and as far back as I can possibly remember up until I was around 17 when I moved out. In Brack-Ex, right outside of Elsmere, Delaware, I lived in a house on Linkwood Avenue that was built in the 1950's and sold to my Grandparents in the 1980's. I am unfamiliar with the home's history before my Grandparents, but I was told that when the house was first purchased (or shortly after purchasing), my Grandfather had to remove two headstones that were put in the front yard by a big tree near the front porch. Apparently, my Grandfather threw them beyond the backyard/property line where there were tons of bamboo and train tracks. However, this is was thought to be a random prank. Or maybe the 'prank' part was cover up because my Grandparents didn't want us believing/messing with the ghosts in our house. 

I was raised in a heavily religious family. My Grandmother was old school Italian, the best cook you could ever meet, and she had the kindest heart you could imagine. Every one who came in our house called her 'Mom,"" because, well, that was just her personality in the best way. Even to me. So I will refer to her as Mom here. To give a visual of the house, my Mom collected porcelain dolls, angel figurines, and crosses. They were literally everywhere decorating the entire house in a way that if there was an open space, it was taken with a clutter of some sort. 

My Mom once was standing in the bathroom, with the medicine cabinet mirror facing outward, doing her hair, and was talking to my aunt who was standing at the doorway. Suddenly, she saw my Dad standing behind my aunt in the hallway in the reflection of the mirror. He was just staring off with an expressionless face. He was there, then he wasn't. So she said to my Aunt, where did your Brother go? He was just standing right there and I needed to ask him something. My Aunt proceeded to call my Dad at a friend's home number, and it turns out, my Dad hadn't been home for several hours, and certainly was not just standing behind my Aunt in the doorway. This is the only story my Mom ever told. 

Mom believed that the more you pay attention to it, the more occurrences happen. 

Both of my Grandparents ended up passing away in that home. In the same bedroom. A pretty gruesome death too, battling Cancer. There was also someone who had cut themselves pretty bad in our bathtub in the more recent years. The person didn't die, but it was bad enough that lots of blood had to be cleaned. 

 After my Mom died, we all slept in the living room together as a way to cope. We didn't want to be alone. The night of Mom's funeral, I was trying to fall asleep but had opened my eyes to see down the hallway and in the reflection of this old oval mirror, was her face staring back at me. She was wearing her favorite black robe. Smiling. I never slept on the couch facing that way ever again.

I had night terrors often, almost nightly. I was terrified all the time in the house growing up. I felt watched, constantly. I always felt uneasy. Always felt there was a presence. I slept with my Mom in the same bed in her room every single night up until she passed away, when I was 13. That room had a lot of activity. There would be nights where she would be asleep, and I would watch as this black shadow thing would dance in the corners of the ceiling and then go away. The blanket covering my eyes was my best friend. This happened so many times it almost felt routine and started to not frighten me anymore. 

One night, I was wide awake as she slept. I looked down to the foot of the bed and saw the figure of a woman standing there. It looked like a shadow, but I could tell it was a woman because it was in the shape of a woman and had breasts and a curved figure. It also seemed to have had some kind of wrap on its head. At the time to me as a child, I figured it was a towel. This figure kept doing the weirdest dance at the foot of the bed. It was stomping its legs and its arms were extended out vertically and moving up and down and the figure would just turn in circles. This went on for I don't even know how long; time stood still. I was just stuck staring at it and couldn't look away. I don't remember how it stopped, but all I could do was wrap my arm around my Grandmother and fall asleep next to her, scared shiatless, but not wanting to disturb her.

During the day, I was in my bedroom minding my own business, playing with my Barbie dolls and dollhouses. The only two people that were home were me and Mom. She was at the front of the house in the living room watching her favorite show while I was in the back of the house in my room. The bedroom door was open. Suddenly, right outside my door I hear clear as day, something whisper out loud ""TELL HER!, JUST TELL HER!"" I immediately dropped what I had in my hand and ran out of my room so quickly you'd think I was on fire. I told my Mom what happened and she brushed it off. Told me to go back and play. I assure you, there was nobody else home. No way it was Mom, she was at the other end of the house and the whispers were so vivid, clear, and loud. I also didn't have a TV in my room yet. From that day on, I shut and locked my bedroom door, no matter what. 

There were several occasions that I would hear knocking at my bedroom door, and would open it and nobody would be there. I hounded everyone in the house so many times and even ask to this day if anyone was messing me and they all swear up and down no. I would also hear my name be called a lot and nobody was actually calling it.

One morning as a teenager I was sleeping facing the wall and hearing my name be called right in my ear. It woke me up out of a deep sleep. I turned around almost immediately, no one was there. My door was still shut, and locked like it was before I fell asleep. 

This is the one that creeps me out the most still to this day. I mentioned before that my Mom collected porcelain dolls and that they were everywhere throughout the house. At least a hundred of them. Well, my Mom started buying me my own as well. First and foremost, they always creeped me out. I always felt like they were watching me and it seemed like their eyes would follow me as I walked by them. There was a bride doll in my Mom's room that looked just like her and I was deathly afraid of it. I had night terrors of it a lot. Anyway, one day I was playing around with my porcelain doll. It had blue eyes, blonde hair, black pants, a black checkered top, and a cute little hat and purse. I had accidentally dropped it on the carpet and it landed face down. I for whatever reason apologized to it (I was a child) and picked it up. I faced it toward me and I kid you not, it had a tear rolling down its cheek. I can't make this stuff up, and I sort of wish I was. After I saw that, I put it back up on the shelf in my grandfather's room and never played with or touched it again. Or any of the other dolls for that matter. 

One day I was on my little swing set in the yard, swinging. Our yard was surrounded by woods. To my right, there was a little opening. Well out of nowhere, there was a man that popped out and made me look up as I heard rustling of leaves. He was just standing there in this odd position. As a kid, I thought it was some stranger trying to kidnap me or something, so I instantly ran forward as fast as I could inside the house and shut and locked the glass door behind me. But nobody followed. I didn't see anyone. I didn't tell my Mom about this either because I didn't want to worry her, and she was the only one home. I also didn't tell her, because I ended up realizing it was an apparition. I know this because of the way the man was dressed. He was dressed exactly like a pioneer from the late 1800's early 1900's.Brown pants with suspenders, a white button down shirt, boots, and a brown hat. The man had shoulder length messy light brown hair. He had really tan skin but also had dirt on his face. It looked like a man you would see in the show 'Little House on The Prairie.' Which ironically, was one of my Moms favorite shows. I don't think a kidnapper would be wearing something like that in the early 2000's.

Late at night I was standing in the dark kitchen eating a snack as the dining room light behind me illuminated my way enough. The kitchen had a fairly large window. At the time, I could not see anything out of it. It was pitch black. I could see the reflection of the kitchen wallpaper. And on it, I saw two shadows pass by, one after the other. I looked behind me and nothing was there. This type of occurrence would happen frequently, seeing shadows out of the corner of my eye. But this occasion sticks out the most to me.

Every one had an imaginary friend as a child, right? Well I named mine Alesha for whatever reason. As I grew up, I went through a short phase of pretending Alesha was real. Remember earlier I mentioned that my Mom once said 'the more attention you give it, the more active it is.' Well I found out she was absolutely correct. As I gave Alesha more attention I felt as I was being watched more and more. Felt uneasy more and more. Now this right here still gives me chills today; when it was dinner time and I would get called to the table, I would say ""Come on Alesha, time for dinner!"" and as I would walk to the kitchen, I would look behind me, and see little footprints appear in the blue carpet behind me, following. This didn't happen every day, but it did happen several times. One day, I saw a girl's face in the reflection of the TV that I finally got in my room, and it scared the living hell out of me. I figured it was Alesha. From that point on, I stopped giving Alesha attention. And I never saw footsteps again. 

So those are my stories. My 110% true, can replay memories in my head, true encounters. I have not lived in that house since I was 17. I am now almost 30. My father still lives in that house, but says he doesn't have any encounters. Me however, I refuse to sleep in that house again. I refuse to go in alone at night time. As soon as I walk in, every single time, I get this overwhelming shadow of depression and negative energy that floods over my entire body. And I start to feel like I'm being watched again. There is definitely something in that house. I wanted to be ballsy and play with a Ouija board in there as an adult, but my Dad won't allow it. Which is probably a good thing."
"Knocking At My Window?","Virginia","Haunted Places","I still get the creeps when telling this story.

About 9 months ago, at the end of July, my family and I went on vacation to a spot in Virginia (We've been going to the same spot for 5 years straight.) 

It was the middle of the night when I woke up to this light tapping at the window across from the bed me and my brother were sharing. The room was decently big, with the bed pushed against the wall in the center of the room and two smaller closets to the left (on my side) on either end of the wall. A window was next to the closet in the far left corner of the room from the bed, with a TV beside it. 

Before I went to bed that night, I had turned on light rain sounds on the TV, and so it was playing queasily in the background while I sat up in bed, tired and weary. The knocking turned into loud thumps that made my heart race and my palms sweaty. By the sound of it, I could have sworn someone - or something - was standing outside the window, pounding on the window, which wasn't unreasonable considering the room was on the first floor, near the entrance of the building. 

Looking at the alarm clock on my bedside nightstand, I realized it was very unreasonable. It was a quarter after 3 (which, of course it was; why wouldn't I wake up at the witching hour with tapping on the window and this utter dread filling my stomach?) 

I don't understand how I missed it, because she was standing right next to it. Beside the window, or rather, a little in front of it, was a girl with long, dripping wet, black hair cascading down her face and body, basically hiding all of her from how long it was. She was wearing this worn-out white dress that ended on the floor. I couldn't see any limbs at all. She reminded me of that girl from the ring. Just less TV-like and real. 

For a good ten seconds, I kind of just stared at her, waiting and watching, praying that this was some sick nightmare that I was about to wake up from. The panic hadn't yet set in, either. When I realized she wasn't moving or doing anything, I slid under the covers, biting back the tears of fear. I was 14 then - not young, but not old either - so the fear was pretty reasonable.

After taking a few deep breaths and encouraging myself to look again, she was gone. She just vanished. The tapping on the window hadn't ceased; if anything, it got a bit louder. It also started raining after a few minutes of me just sitting there, staring at the spot where the girl once stood. 

I woke my bear of a brother up, almost crying from how scared I was. I told him what I saw, shaking shiatless as I did so. He kind of just nodded, pretty much still asleep. Now, he isn't much younger than me, being 12 at the time, but he was pretty useless as I complained about the tapping on the window. 

He told me to wake mom and whine to her, I told him I wouldn't, so annoyed, he begged me to just turn up the TV and go back to sleep. I did, and to this day the memory of that girl, standing by that window is burned into my mind. And to think I will be in that room again this year reminds me of the fear I had that night."
"Seeing Red Eyes At Night, Need Help","Maine","Haunted Places","Bit of background first, the first time this happened it was a number of years ago and I was probably at least 13 or 14 years old the first time it happened. The area I live in is kind of rural. I live across from an orchard, with one house on a small hill above us right next door, and one slightly below us on the other side of our house with a massive wooded area directly behind our house. The house above us next door is kind of separated by a line of trees. We can still see each house just there's obviously trees, and the road is like... 20 to 25 feet maybe 30 away from the front of each house.

It was night, so pitch black outside. We don't have any street lights where we live because again, kind of a rural area. We have a grape arbor near the middle of our property, I can literally stand on our deck and look to the house above us and the TOP of the grape arbor is just below ground level with the section of land their house sits on. Behind the arbor is a bit of lawn and some garden and then the tree line, and there's a thick tree between where our grape arbor is and our neighbors mailbox with red reflective discs on it. Blocked by the tree, you can't even see their mailbox, so I know what I saw was not those reflective disks. 

It was DARK like pitch black dark, I had just opened up our kitchen door to let our dog outside to use the bathroom and the motion light goes on because of the door and my dog WOULD NOT step outside. All he would do, was peer outside TOWARDS our neighbors mailbox and stare. I thought ok it's Maine, does he see a racoon or a fox or maybe one of the neighbors cats? 

No, I looked up and ABOVE the grape arbor, more towards where the thick tree is that blocks the view of our neighbors mailbox were these two glowing red eyes. I thought that ok maybe it's just an owl or something, I don't know. I tilted my head, and it COPPIED me, the eyes TILTED to match my movement and BLINKED. Our motion light doesn't even reach 5 feet past the deck, so I had no clue what it was I couldn't see anything past the light. My dog freaked out, like full on claws scrambling against the tile floor, snarling and barking as he RAN deeper into the house and my reaction is obviously look down when my dog starts freaking out. 

I looked back up and it was STANDING just out of view of the light like maybe another 6 feet past the light? So much closer, the eyes were LEVEL with my own and I'm still standing in the door, the deck is a good foot off the ground and the door has a step leading up so that's two feet right there, and I'm like 5 foot maybe 5 foot 2. The red dots or eyes were LEVEL. WITH MY HEAD. I have NO idea what it was at the time, I just slammed the door shut and locked it and went to my room and acted like I saw nothing.

Fast forward some years, and literally like three days ago I started to hear just like a tapping noise when it would start to get dark. I'd look out the window, nothing's there, tapping's gone. Another time I could have SWORN I hear my dad calling me so I call out back asking what he wants and I get nothing. I look out the window to the driveway and his work truck is still gone, he's not home. The other day I saw the same thing I did years ago when I was a kid. Red eyes, just this time near the trail that leads outback into the woods.

I shut my blinds, made sure the doors were locked, lights off, and just I guess pulled a ""Nope, didn't see that. No one's home you got the wrong address, goodbye"" sort of mentality I guess? I'm curious as to what it is I saw, the red eyes thing. I can deal with spooky sounds just fine, I can deal with that I'm good that doesn't bother me. But it's the eyes, the red eyes that look like they'd be about SEVEN FEET off the ground that's freaking me out. If ANYONE has any idea what it might have been that I could have seen, I would GREATLY appreciate some input here, because now I just don't bother looking outside out the windows when it's dark, I pull the whole ""If you don't see it, it's not there."" thing, but some of the windows on this house DO NOT have blinds or shades, and it's the ones in the kitchen THAT FACE THE WOODS. It freaks me out, because I always feel WATCHED at night if I'm in the kitchen now, and those windows? Those windows are on the top floor, the basement door and windows are below them. It's a two story drop out those kitchen windows. 

I just I would really love it if someone could give me any sort of input as to what the heck I might have seen because I don't like it, and I want it gone. I want it gone like, 6 years ago sort of gone, so just... Any input at all is helpful at this point."
"The Haunting Of My House","Iowa","Haunted Places","During the first 8 months of me living here in this house that was built in the 1800s. I saw a black shadow figure of a girl that dragged my dog under the bed. My dog was held under my bed for 10 minutes. My parents didn't believe what I saw until they had their own experience. 

One night my sister stopped breathing and I was asleep next to her. I didn't wake up and I don't have a history of sleep walking. My dad said he was suddenly awoken by a girl that looked just like me. He said the girl sounded, acted, and even looked exactly like me. She even wore the same thing I wore to bed that night. So that of course made my dad believe it was me.

 He told me the girl was saying in a stern voice like I do when I try to wake him up, ""Dad, get up, Elexa is not breathing."" My dad tried to fall back asleep but she wouldn't let him. Once my dad was sat up in bed and putting on his slippers he walked to the stairs fast and she was gone, he didn't even hear her going down the stairs which creak like crazy. My dad and mom went downstairs and got my sister responsive and breathing, my dad then forcefully woke me up and accused me of going back to sleep when my sister wasn't breathing I told him he was crazy and I had no idea what he was talking about. He told me the story and I knew he seen a ghost. 

When my mom heard the story she laughed and told my dad he was crazy until she walked back up the stairs to go to bed and she heard a little girl aggressively say boo. My mom came running down the stairs to tell us what she heard and my dad looked at her and called her crazy. 

The only other thing we heard as a family were footsteps. We were all sitting down having dinner one night when all of us went silent. We heard men's work boots stomping around upstairs. My dad grabbed his gun and walked up the stairs he went through every room with our old dog, Tank, who was a Rottweiler. They both came back down and found nothing. 

My dad had experiences too. First of course it was the little girl. Then one night it was 3:00AM and he was asleep in his chair, suddenly he was thrown with his chair across the living room. He woke up and was lying on the floor with his recliner and he got up and put it back in place and went back to sleep. He then told me he was asleep in his chair which is right by a vent that leads to the basement when suddenly he heard a man's voice say, ""Well hello."" My dad got his gun and Tank and told Tank to go through every room in the basement. Tank did as he was told and came back with no one my dad also found nobody. 

Now at 15 years old I have been having experiences at night. I've experienced seeing a man who looked very malnourished and lean staring at my closet and when I tried to ask who he was a turned and smiled at me and then disappeared. I then saw a little girl who had long dark hair who was staring at my closet too and when I was asking her who she was she didn't turn around just disappeared. I then saw a little girl at the foot of my bed who laughed and she jumped and tried to bite my arm but then she disappeared. Every time I see these people I jump out of bed and just run I don't know where I'm going but I just run. I need help and I need advice on what to do in this situation of multiple experiences."
"Unfortunate Events","Iowa","Haunted Places","I'm sorry but this is going to be a long story. In 2017 my family moved into a new house that was built in the 1800s. Our first 8 months were fine even though I felt really uneasy. My parents got me a little dog to help calm my nerves which helped me. Until one night I was bringing food to my room and she stood in front of the door wagging her tail waiting for me to put it down when she was pulled under the bed and held there for a total of 10 minutes. 

Me being 8 was scared to help her so I ran to get my dad and he ran in with his gun and picked up the bed slightly. Whatever it was let my dog go and she ran to me immediately. I then glanced over and saw a black figure of a girl lying under my bed but before anyone else could see she disappeared.

 Nobody believed the things I saw until one night my little sister stopped breathing nobody knew and she could've died but a girl who looked just liked me, my dad swears by the Bible he saw her, woke my dad up and before he got out of bed she was gone. My dad was of course mad at me but I was confused because it wasn't me. My dad believed now what I was seeing. All the stuff I was seeing stopped until I hit 15. I started seeing people at the end of my bed at night. I saw a little girl one night laughing and a little boy the other doing the same thing. Then I saw a dead man facing my closet and another girl facing my closet all on different nights. I try speaking to them but they just look at me and smile. Can someone tell me what to do? I'm scared."
"Black Panther, Trying To Get My Foot","Alabama","Pets / Animals","Before I lived where I do now, I use to live in a neighborhood in the suburbs of Alabama, specifically in Crestwood, on south hall RD. The house was not really old and had been built in 1963 or there about. From what I remember we really did not have any other kids in the neighborhood it was full of old folks. My grandparents, on my father's side, live about three houses down opposite of the street. I was probably about 5 years of age maybe older but definitely no more than 7 and a half because that's when we moved. The house had an addition to it dubbed the playroom downstairs that myself and my younger brother were never fond of going in by ourselves especially at night, creepy feelings but nothing ever happened in that room. I have always considered myself a practical person even when I was a child. But what I am about to say is absolutely true to the experience I had. It only happened once but it was terrifying, 

One night, must have been during the summer I was lying in my bed hot, uncomfortable and unable to sleep. I don't remember the time but it was pretty late. I remember getting up and going into my parents room and climbing into their bed where a celling fan was on. I got between my father's and mother's legs and was lying on my back. At the bottom of the bed there is a footboard, a thick post that ran across the bottom slightly above the mattress. This is where I had and would often prop my feet up or press with my foot against it. 

I was lying in the bed for what seemed awhile, the celling fan above me was on and I was aware my surroundings still restless. The two pull strings on the fan used to turn up the speed and turn on the fan light were clicking together. I remember just staring at its movements thinking to myself, I wish they would stop clicking. Not soon after I hear a noise at the foot of the bed I look down and see a black panther gnawing the post seemingly trying to get at my foot. This thing was as clear as the nose on my face. I remember the yellow eyes. I was so terrified that I had loss of breath and remember that I had to consciously take in a breath to scream. I let out a blood curdling scream that shot both parents awake. Frantically I climbed back up toward the headboard between my parents keeping my eye on this thing. My mother started screaming and my dad shot out of bed turning on the lamp on his night stand. The second that light went on the figure poofed, vanishing instantly.

 My parents were shaken by the sudden awaking and I was crying terrified at what I had witnessed. I explain what I saw and my mother and I stayed in bed, I clung to her like glue, my father cautiously checked all around but saw nothing. It took convincing but I was shown that there was nothing there. My parents to this day chock it up as a nightmare but I was absolutely awake and tell them so.

 This was so vivid and terrified me so much that it has been kind of hard to forget 30 + years later. To this day I cannot explain exactly what that was because it looked and sounded like a living breathing black panther but the fact that it vanished the way it did with no trace has me absolutely stumped. The doors and windows were all shut. Nothing was in there when I left my room and went into their room. This thing was there one moment and gone the next. Longer than 5 seconds. I absolutely don't have any other explanation besides paranormal. But I never saw it again and nothing has ever appeared since in my life. I'm now 36 by the time I'm writing this.

 There was some uneasy feeling whenever my brother and I were alone but I think that was just being really young and afraid of the dark quiet as kids usually are. 

I don't spook real easy. And as a kid loved scary things like the amusement park haunted house. I would even position myself at bottom of my bed and so I could look into my parents' bedroom off the reflection of the mirror to watch late night tv - Tales of the Crypt fascinated me but it never scared me so I don't think that has anything to do with it. I was old enough that I could discern a nightmare from reality and I'm convinced it was not that.

I will add a few additional notes and details. Before I was born or at least when very young, my grandmother would have one of her best friends over to her house, (the one down the street,) and would hold seances using Ouija boards.

 I'm repeating what I was told, but from what I remember, the stories go like this, they asked the spirit if it was good or bad and it responded bad. Evidently this spooked them enough that they quit doing it. But for the longest time those Ouija boards 2 of them, a smaller one and I guess the standard one everyone seems to know, ended up in the bottom of our kitchen pantry laying against the wall. I remember once or twice getting them out and spelling my name and various words learning my ABC and Numbers with them when I was really young maybe 3 or 4. These were eventually thrown out at some point or sold in a garage sale. But nothing strange ever happened in the kitchen or pantry nor with the boards themselves... At least not around me that I know of... But that's the only thing I can think of though that's an afterthought. I also have Cherokee in my blood though it's so far removed I doubt it has anything to do with this. I have more Frankish decent from my mother's side of the family. Speaking of parents my mother has protector personality and tries to calm and have everyone get along. My father has always had little patience and has a quick fiery temper. My younger brother has a follower personality. I have a creative and inquisitive personality but very based I like to think.

Anyway. I've always wondered what it was that I saw exactly because last time I checked black panthers just don't turn up in bedroom and vanish when the light turns on. I'm wondering if anyone has had something similar happen or could shed some light on this event. I tried listing everything I could possibly think that might have a possible link or connection but I'm more curious than anything. This is the one event in my life I can't practically explain. I saw what I saw and this is how I saw it."
"Two Fiascos, Two Unusual Rescues","Ohio","Misc","This date of infamy took place in 1972 just two weeks after I turned 18 years old. I became engaged to Bill, my former first husband, and biggest mistake of my life. Unfortunately, that misfortune was not known to me at the time. It took some years to learn.

I was dating him for close to a year when he proposed. I declined since I had plans to go to college, learn something to establish a career, and simply be independent and stand on my own two feet until such time as I chose to settle down. However, Bill 'talked' me into it. Oh, he was good. He could make you 'believe' the moon was pink with purple polka-dots. He actually had me believing that he really loved me. Suddenly, the plans that I had made for my life went out the window and I was in a romantic tail-spin and my hormones took charge. 

My parents didn't approve of him, or the idea of marrying at such a young age, but ""I"", of course being 18, thought that I knew it 'all'. I thought they were being unreasonable. How very wrong I was as I was, much later, to find out. Ouch!

Since my family didn't approve, we conspired to 'run away', and get married. I was able to leave the state at 18 legally. We took his foster parents, Esther and Dave, with us to be witnesses (Also, Bill was broke and Dave and Esther had the money-I thought Bill would pay them back, lol!), and went to Catlettsburg, Kentucky. In Kentucky you could marry at 16 without parental consent. I don't know if they have since changed that law. We were there for 3 days for the blood test results-back then you had to get a blood test before getting a marriage license. 

We stayed in a road side Motel during that time. Bill, and I went out to get some food from a McDonalds-that was the best we could afford.

Upon coming back we were driving down a long, lonely country road. It wasn't much more than a dirt road. A rather long one, too. We were just diddy-bopping along when we felt a huge ker-thud that shook the car. We didn't 'see' any huge potholes, but it felt like we drove through one. Something told me to turn around and look behind us. There, in the road behind us, lay our gas tank (you can laugh now.). Bill had a rust bucket of a station wagon-a Ford, I think-that he was holding together with bailing wire and paper-clips (more laughter). I informed him that we had just lost our gas tank in the road. He laughed and said I was seeing things because the car was still moving. I, again, told him ""I know what a gas tank looks like and 'ours' is in the road back there"". Again, he said I was nuts. Meanwhile the gas gauge is gradually going down, down, down, to empty. The car stops. Bill, surprised, exclaimed, ""Hey. We're out of gas and I filled the tank"".

 My reaction to that was-""That's what I'm 'trying' to tell you. We lost our tank in the road back there."" He looked in the rearview mirror and realized I was 'right'.

We had to carry a full tank of gas about a quarter mile back to the car (you haven't lived until you've done that one.). When we got back to the car Bill had me help him get the tank into the back seat of the car on the passenger's side-another fun task. After that he rolled the window half-down, and crawled under the car just enough to grab the gas line. The soft copper tubing that connected to the tank. He brought it up through the partially rolled down back window and connected it to the tank (honest. This is the truth!). We were, then, able to continue driving back to the motel. 

We got up early the next day and went with Esther and Dave to a Church that we found the day before and made arrangements with the Pastor to marry us in. His wife played the organ for us. How romantic. Boy, was I stupid, stupid, dumb, dumb. That was just the beginning of our marital bliss, lol!

On the way back to Willoughby, we went through Columbus. While going through Columbus it was getting dark about then and a cop stopped us. Bill pulled over. The policeman told Bill that one of his taillights was out. When he asked to see Bill's license, I got the shock of my life when Bill admitted that he didn't have one. I found out later that Bill had been driving since the age of 15. He just never bothered to get a license. About that time the officer noticed the tank in the back seat of the car. Driving without a license, taillight out, and unsafe vehicle. Oh goody! We were all taken to the Columbus city courthouse/jail.

 Esther and Dave were able to go the Greyhound Bus Station, get a couple tickets and get back home to Willoughby. I, on the other hand, stayed with my new husband. I waited in the courthouse while he was processed and escorted to a jail cell.

 I was seated on a bench outside of the desk sergeant's office when he came out to interview me. He assumed that I was 15, or 16 years old. I told him I was 18 (big difference. Right.). I never did 'look' my age. I was being carded for cigarettes until I was 40 and began to appear to be 21. He told me that he had a daughter that was just a year younger than me. He felt sorry for me and ushered me into the office. He then took me to the Police Commissioner's office. He set up 4 over-stuffed leather chairs and got me an army blanket. He said I could sleep there until he had to get me up in the morning before the commissioner got in around 8Am. He told me that Bill will be arraigned tomorrow morning, but didn't know what time it would be as there were other cases before him. I slept, but was full of trepidation and fear. I was wondering what to do in the midst of all this.

 I spent 'my' honeymoon night in the Columbus jail. How romantic. All the warning signs were there that 'this' marriage was a disaster, but dumb, dumb me, I didn't pay attention at the time. 

The sergeant woke me up around 7:30 and gave me 5 bucks to go downstairs to the cafeteria to get something to eat. I cried and told him I could never pay him back, but he said it was alright. That it was a gift. I proceeded downstairs to the cafeteria and got an egg, toast and some orange juice for $1.25 (the prices were different in the early 70's.). I felt like throwing up though after eating. I was just so upset, scared, disappointed, and angry that all 'this' was happening. I wasn't about to call my parents for help. Oh, no. Not me. I had my pride. I know, I know. Pride comes before the fall, but this was 'my' problem and I was determined to deal with it. Even if I wound up in the gutter, I wasn't calling for help.

There was a ladies room just twenty feet from the bench I was sitting on. It was lined up in a long straight hallway. I decided to go in the ladies room for a little refuge. Actually, I went in there to cry and pray. There were 2 chairs on each end near the stalls and the place was completely empty. I sat on the chair closest to the door and began crying and praying my heart out. I was asking God for answers to my dilemma. 

Rather unexpectedly, an attractive blonde woman came into the restroom. She looked to be in her 30's to early 40's and dressed in a very smart business suit. I assumed she was some kind of secretary. I quickly turned my head and wiped my eyes, but she caught it. She began

Asking me what was wrong? However, my pride took over and I said nothing was wrong, but she knew better. She told me to tell her what the problem was. She put her arm around me and when I looked into her eyes something just 'told' me that I could 'trust' her.

 I began to pour my heart out to this perfect stranger. She listened intently, and took me over to the sinks and we washed my eyes out and dried them. All the while she was telling me that no matter how bad it looked, that everything would work out and I'd be alright. She also said that someone was watching over me (an odd statement, but I believed her). She walked me back out into the hall and crushed a ten dollar bill into my hand. Once again, I cried and told her that I was unable to pay her back, but she said it was a gift, and not to worry about it. This is where it got strange. It took me all of 2 whole seconds to stick that ten dollar bill in my purse. I looked up to thank her again and she 'was gone'.

She was wearing high-heels and I didn't 'hear' her walk away. That hallway was too long for me not to see her walking away. Other then the restroom with a noticeably squeaky door, there weren't any doors close enough for her to duck into. She literally evaporated into thin air.

At this point I was stunned, but, also quite wrung out from all the crying I did. I went back to the bench to wait. Just then a lieutenant came up the hallway toward me. He informed me that Bill was being released, but we 'had' to give up the car. It was in impound. However, we had permission to go to the garage to get our belongings out of the car. Just that fast. After that woman told me that things will work out, Bill was released. I was just happy to see him. Was she an angel, or a kindly ghost? I wonder.

We left the station and with the money I had, went to the Greyhound station to get a couple tickets, but we called Dave first. We figured that he was long back in Willoughby by this time. I was somewhat miffed when Dave told Bill that he'd called my parents to let them know what happened without my permission. In retrospect, I'm grateful that Dave called them, but I digress.

By the Grace of God, my Mom came to the bus station, embraced me like I've never been embraced, took us to the garage so we could get our belongings out of the car, and drove us back home. Dad was elated to see his daughter was alright, but oh, how he wanted to strangle Bill.

Again, in retrospect, I cannot blame him.

During the marriage I kept getting spiritual visitations from my Grandma. Every year on September 20th. The date of her passing. At first, I was at a loss to explain it. I confided in Bill about the visits. He told me I was wacky and laughed. Well, he got his.

 After Esther and Dave passed away we stayed in Esther's house while it was being probated per the request of her cousin, Luella. We were sleeping one morning when I 'heard' the entry door open, and close. I heard grandma call my name to get up because it was getting late. Grandma got up before the chickens having lived in the country. I just remained in bed anticipating what she'd do next. I knew from experience what she was going to do. If I didn't stir, she'd shake the bed until I 'did' get up. Ha, ha. I just laid there with Bill next to me. She began shaking the bed, and I got up and was standing at the end of the bed while Bill bolted upright saying what the 'bleep' is going on? I announced that it was grandma shaking the bed and he best get up. He laughed, said I was wacky, and laid back down. At that point the bed not only shook, it was almost being lifted from off the floor. Bill literally shot-put about 5 feet from the bed to the floor in a panic. Right on, Granny!

Shortly after that I had a strange dream visit from her. She told me that Bill didn't love me and was using me. She advised me to get out of that marriage because there was someone worthwhile waiting to meet me. I woke up with a slight start from that dream, but it all began to make sense. Those visits were trying to alert me to what Bill was really like. He was robbing me of funds, and cheating on me every chance he got. Someone was definitely watching over me. I kicked him out and filed for divorce.

During the interim that we were living apart, I met John, my wonderful 2nd husband. He helped me in the divorce process and it went smoothly. John and I were living together shortly after we met. We just clicked right away. The 2nd week we were together John had a strange dream that he confided in me when we were at the kitchen table the following morning drinking coffee. He said that he had a dream in which he saw an elderly woman from the shoulders up talking to him. She told him to ""take care of my little Linda now because she knows how much he really loved me."". That was where the dream ended. He described my grandma to a tee. I dug out a photo album and asked him to see if there was anyone he recognized in it. After a few minutes he pointed out my grandma. A woman he had never met. We had over 30 happy years together until he passed on, but he is still 'always' with me. 

I am not imposing my beliefs on anyone reading this, but ""I"" believe that even though our loved ones are not with us in the physical sense, they 'are' with us in the spiritual sense. I, now feel, like John is with me helping me in times of anxiety, or uncertainty. 

I apologize for the length of this account, but I felt it necessary to explain the foundations from which this paranormal help and guidance evolved. I think that sometimes help, or guidance comes even from the paranormal realms. Just my belief and opinion. Thanks for reading!"
"Clicking Noises","Kentucky","Misc","I just moved to Kentucky from Illinois. I've been here a month and until last night I've not experienced a haunting. The place I left had a lot of action that was happening regularly. I even accidentally recorded 2 ghost voices and heard those voices myself afterwards a few times. 

 The reason I'm writing this is because I'd had an odd experience for many years. A clicking noise waking me up, much different from a ghost or poltergeist. At first I worried it was my brain making up the noise. I still don't know. I do know I'm not comfortable responding or communicating with spirits because I've had bad experiences in the past. I don't know if someone is try to communicate that is good or bad. I'd had hauntings my entire life. Anyway I was awakened by the clicking noises sounding metallic. It was a little different this time as it was moving around my room and clicking. I had to prayer protection at least 3 times and center my mind on myself on Jesus to finally have it stop. I feel it was trying to scare me and I know somethings feed on fear. So not something I have the strength on my own to communicate with.

 Anyone out there that knows of this please respond. 

 I have to confess I kind of enjoy having ghosts in my life yet I don't let myself open up to them in case they affect me in a negative way. I also have dreams occasionally that are totally different from regular dreams and am somewhat psychic. Also premonitions happen occasionally.

 I am 71 years old and at age 29 I had an amazing spiritual healing through dreams for 10 days which started when a Nun and Priest prayed for me. I was infused with love that connects everyone in entirety by Jesus, at least I believe it was Jesus. My life changed and it was amazing."
"New House For Rent-the Ghost Is Free","Ohio","Haunted Places","This incident happened back in 1982. My sister, J told me about it just recently. Matter of fact. She told me about it last week. She 'thought' she told me years ago, but forgot to. Instead her 3 friends know about it. J and one of her friends-call her Lori-were there when it happened. It took place in Eastlake, Ohio. A small community of Lake County.

J and Lori went to visit another friend that was, still, a relative newly-wed. Her friend, Jenny, and her husband were married only a couple years, and had a 4 month old daughter. They had just moved into a new rental house. The house was very attractive with 2 bedrooms, and 2 bathrooms, an ample-sized living room, kitchen, and laundry room with an attached 2-car garage. It didn't have a basement, but a fairly decent sized fenced in backyard. Just perfect for a young couple starting out. They signed a 2-year lease with a rent-to-own option at the end of the lease period.

My sister, J and Lori were invited over to their new house about 3 months after they settled in. Lori and J Got them a nice basket of fruit, and cheese, and some toys for the baby. They were somewhat excited to see their friend's new house. 

They got there early in the afternoon in time for coffee, donuts, and just relaxing to chat. Lori noticed that Jenny was a little subdued, and not quite as bubbly as she usually was. This was out of character for Jenny, and they noticed it. J and Lori were hoping that Jenny, and her hubby weren't having any marital troubles, but were too afraid to ask for fear of sounding nosey. However, they were concerned. Even Jenny's husband, Bob, seemed a little withdrawn, and had difficulty holding a conversation. 

They had been talking a little over an hour when Bob finally decided not to be hesitant anymore, and spilled the beans about 'why' they were acting like they were. He told Jenny that he could tell that J and Lori were noticing their less than jovial behavior. He said ""They're your old friends. They've known you for years. They'll believe us.""

 Jenny took a deep breath, and shook her head in agreement giving Bob permission to explain what was going on.

J and Lori listened attentively as Bob, rather cautiously, began telling them what was going on with the new house since they got settled in recently. The first couple months they were far to busy unpacking, situating, and organizing everything. All this while Bob had to go to work mind you. I'm sure they were pretty tired after all that. Not to mention taking care of an infant. So they really didn't notice anything unusual during that time. However, after the dust settled and they began to relax in their new environment, they began to notice some perplexing and unnerving events taking place in their beautiful new home. Events that they could not explain rationally. Such things as objects disappearing and showing up in the most ridiculous places, or just never showing up again. The sliding door closet in the baby's nursery was always ice-cold. Even on the hottest of days. There was a light in that closet that had a string you had to pull to turn it on.

Frequently that closet light was on with neither of them touching it. They would store the baby's basinet in there when it wasn't in use. One day Jenny went to retrieve the basinet to bathe the baby. She unfolded it and began setting it up. She had just put water in the little tub, and was about to set the baby in it when the entire unit just fell apart. Fortunately she was holding the baby when it collapsed.

When she inspected it to determine what the cause was she was astounded to find that 'all' the screws, joints, braces and bolts were removed and lying in a small pile on the floor of the closet. That was utterly inexplicable as well as frightening. Jenny took the baby with her into the living room and called Bob. He could hear the panic in her voice and advised her to go across the street to the neighbors until he could get back home in another couple hours. She was, more than, happy to get out of the house to go visit. Besides the neighbor enjoyed playing with the baby. Jenny, of course, did not tell the neighbor 'why' she came over, but the neighbor didn't mind.

When Bob got home from work Jenny took him to show him the disassembled basinet, but it was no longer in the nursery. They found it in a heap on the floor of the kitchen. Jenny left the house. She didn't put it there, and it sure wasn't the baby. They both began to feel something almost electric in the atmosphere. Making the hair on their bodies stand on end. Neither one has any psychic capabilities. Yet, they 'both' felt the same sensation coupled with an intense cold spot in the kitchen that wasn't there previously.

This was beyond their comprehension. As much as neither one wanted to admit it, this was something paranormal. They couldn't hem and haw it away anymore. According to Jenny and her husband the episodes were starting to escalate to the point that they were afraid to even be in the house at all. They were beginning to feel unwelcome and threatened, but by 'who', or 'what'? There wasn't anything that they could physically point to as the root of the problem. It was unseen, but making them extremely aware of it's presence.

My sister, and her friend could see the sincerity, as well as, unmistakable fear in the faces of the couple as they reported everything that had been taking place in the house. This young couple was truly on edge and terrified. Simply not knowing what to do. My sister, and Lori believed them completely.

Bob said he was unsure about how to approach the landlord about it. J reminded him that the landlord never mentioned that the house, or the area was haunted to Jenny and him. Bob thought the landlord didn't know the place was haunted. My sister couldn't buy that. She was pretty sure that the landlord was fully aware of it all along. For one thing-the rent that Bob was paying was 'remarkably'-shall we say-reasonable for such a beautiful home. She told him he should've smelled a rat right then and there. Jenny sheepishly told my sis and Lori that they had taken to keeping the baby with them at all times for fear of what might happen. Jenny told them that every now and then something would pull on the back of her hair to the point that it hurt, but there was never anyone, or anything in the vicinity to account for it. As the typical mother protecting her young she began carrying the baby with her everywhere in the house in one of those baby-carriers with the big handle on it (good mother). They kept the child in her crib right by their bed in their bedroom. If the child so much as let out a peep they would shot-put out of bed with alarm. They were getting hardly any rest by that point in time. Poor Bob still had to go to work to pay the rent leaving Jenny and the baby home alone. That was beginning to go over like a lead balloon.

Jenny said she was getting beyond scared and didn't know where to run to get away from it. When Bob heard that he got angry. Not at Jenny, but at whatever was tormenting them. He began raising his voice and demanding that whatever it was to stop being a coward and show itself. 

That was the wrong thing to say because in challenging it he got an answer. They were all in the kitchen seated around a dinette facing the living room. The baby was sitting in it's carrier on the floor next to Jenny when, suddenly, the baby's blanket was literally ripped out of the carrier and thrown at Bob. The baby began to cry and shake violently. They 'all' saw it. Jenny was seated facing the interior of the living room and shrieked. My sister was distracted by the baby, but the other 3 of them 'saw' a bread knife that was normally kept in the silverware drawer, hovering in mid-air by itself in the middle of the living room. It was suspended in air for several seconds and dropped to the floor.

Jenny and Bob went ballistic. This was the final straw. Jenny screamed ""you leave my baby alone, we're getting out, we're leaving. You can have the lousy house"". My sister, J and Lori hurriedly helped them pack up their suit cases very quickly. They all proceeded to tear out of the house, but not before calling Jenny's parents, who only lived 15 minutes away, to ask them if they could stay with them for a while. They said something traumatic was happening and they would explain further when they got to their home.

Before exiting the house my sister and her friend told whatever it was to stay in the house and leave them alone. They slammed the door behind them.

About a week later Bob called my sister, and Lori to inform them that they were living with Jenny's parents for the time being, until they could secure another place to live. Unfortunately, the landlord of the haunted property was 'holding' Jenny and Bob to the 2-year lease and expecting payment even though they had to flee the place. Bob accused said landlord of renting a haunted home to them without ever disclosing that fact. The landlord told Bob he was nuts and just trying to get out of the lease. Bob became quite indignant and informed the landlord that he was going to sue for failure to disclose that the house was haunted and furthermore he had 2 reliable witnesses to what transpired that drove them from said dwelling. He contacted J and Lori for written depositions verifying what they witnessed. Both girls were happy to oblige. My sister was a legal secretary at the time. She typed up the depositions and got them notarized. They didn't want their friend, and her husband getting cheated by a lying, money-grubbing landlord.

Once Bob had the depositions in hand he and his lawyer paid a call on the landlord. Strangely enough the landlord released them, in writing, from the lease. Once he was confronted with a lawyer and written testimony he didn't have a leg to stand on. Don't you just love it when less than honest people get it stuck to them? 

According to my sister the couple found a nice, slightly smaller, but totally un-haunted house to live in. Their daughter is grown, but she doesn't remember anything as she was a baby during that time. Her parents don't want to tell her. They prefer to leave well enough alone. I trust the validity of my sister's account as her, and I have had shared paranormal encounters before. Also, her friend Lori, who is now a divorcee' living in Eastlake, Ohio, has corroborated this account. Lori and my sis said they've both wanted to write about that incident for many years, but never found the time. I volunteered to do it for them. I apologize for the length of this narrative, but this is the full account as it was recently told to me. Thanks for reading!"
"Gaping Black Holes For Eyes","Iowa","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","My first paranormal experience happened when I was around 7 years old. I was in my mom's bedroom, snooping through her things. I looked up into the mirror of her vanity and standing in the corner facing and watching me was a young girl, she wore a white dress that was torn.

The thing that truly frightened me, that I have never been able to shake off, was its eyes, or lack of I should say. This entity had giant, gaping black holes for eyes. It was like looking into two black holes. It's a vivid detail I would never forget. There were absolutely no eye whites, and the black holes were perfectly circular. 

Next, I was around 9 years old when my family went to Sarajevo, Bosnia (home country) for 2 months during summer break. Our first night there, our neighbors gathered around the house outside to welcome us.

I was standing with my older sister and some neighborhood teenagers. I overheard them talking about how our house is haunted. I wandered off, away from the crowd, to the front of the house. I looked into the window that directly gazed into the living room and the kitchen.

Standing in our kitchen, was a little ghost boy with short black hair that was opening and closing our kitchen drawers. I watched, amazed, as it picked up a spoon and inspected it closely. It turned the spoon around in the air, twisting and examining it.

As if it could sense that I was watching, it snapped its head towards the window and stared at me. It didn't move. Like the ghost girl, it had gaping black holes for eyes. And we just stared at each other for a solid few seconds, with my eyes tracking back to the spoon that it was still holding, and I ran off.

I remember being so scared to sleep at night after that, in that house. I told everyone about it, and my grandma taught me a Muslim prayer that I still use to this day whenever I feel like there is something around me.

Lastly, I saw the third entity when I was around 12 years old. My family and I drove down to Jacksonville, Florida to visit my aunt. I went to the bathroom, washed my hands, and when I looked in the mirror I saw a little ghost boy in the corner of the bathroom. It was daytime when I saw it.

It didn't seem to have an emotion and was expressionless, besides just emptiness and despair. It's eyes, like the other encounters, had giant gaping black holes. It didn't seem like the other ghost boy I had seen in Bosnia- he seemed younger and shorter.

I've lived in the same house my entire life, and I've had one additional experience with the ghost boy, and countless others with the ghost girl. I dreamed about her when I was a teenager. In the dream, I was a child again and we were playing, having a good time. She told me, ""I'm not as bad as I seem."" That's all I remember.

In recent years, the ghost girl woke me up with an electrifying shock on my wrist. I felt something slide off my bed and swear I saw her outline laughing at me.

I'm sharing this because I am wondering if anyone can identify what these entities are, and what they want to do with me. Also, what is the significance of the black eyes? Why has it not been documented before in media?

I've tried to do research but it seems like nothing that comes up is close to what I have experienced. They're not ""black-eyed children"". 

I won't share any more because this post is getting long. Let me know what you're thinking!"
"Sinister Smile Of A Black Ghost","Arizona","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","This happened about 40 years ago, I'm 43 now and since I was so young, I don't remember everything that happened, so the first part I will tell you is what I do remember, the rest is what I was told by my parents.

My dad had just been stationed at Fort Huachuca, AZ, and while we were waiting for military housing we were staying in a motel. Sadly, I don't know where exactly the motel was but I assume it was very close to Fort Huachuca since that's where my dad had to work.

 It all started when my mom and I were getting ready to go to the swimming pool, there at the motel, when she heard me saying in a loud voice ""Stop smiling at me"". I was in her bedroom looking into the open closet, and there on the self in the closet, I could see a black man's face smiling down at me. His eyes were very white as were his teeth. I remember the smile was very sinister and I didn't like it. I wasn't afraid of it, I wasn't old enough to understand fear in that way yet being only around 2 years old.

 My mom thought that there was someone in the room and called to me to go to the pool with her, so I obediently followed her. She got the manager of the motel to go into the apartment and check it out, but of course no body was in there. After he left, and we finished our day at the pool, we went back inside and I went into her room again and started demanding that the man stop smiling at me. This time my mom knew there was no one in the room because they had just checked it and she came into the room to look. I pointed the man out in the closet but she didn't see anything. Later, once my dad was back, he looked and he couldn't see anything either, even though I clearly could. Thinking I was making a face out of reflections or something they had stored in the closet, they tried moving things around but I still saw that sinister smile on the black man's face. Even my grandparents that came to visit us couldn't see it. But I could see him every time I went into that room.

We moved into our new house on base (thankfully I didn't see the face there) From this point on, it's only what my parents told me I saw and spoke to them about.

 One day we had driven to pick my dad up at his office building, it was late but as I sat in the car, I pointed out a black man standing by the office. My mom looked and couldn't see anyone, but it was obvious she was concerned about it and tried hurrying my dad up so we could go home.

The last time I saw him, at least that I'm told, was at a cemetery. My mom and I were walking around this old cemetery in the middle of the day looking at I presume old civil war graves and I told my mom, ""Look, that black man just fell down."" My mom tried looking around but we were the only two there.

I was between 3 - 6 for the stories after the initial motel, though at the motel I could've been close to 3 as we lived there only 3 years. My mom found it strange how I always described him as a black man because as far as she knew, I had never met a real black man at that point in time. It's also noteworthy that the base my dad worked at was an old buffalo soldiers barracks during the civil war. I never saw anything else like that after we moved, and though I don't remember most of it, I can remember seeing him in the closet, just his head, staring down at me with that sinister smile that haunts my memory still.

I'm curious if anyone else has had or seen an experience like this down in AZ around that area? I would love to visit the area again, just to see if I can see anything again, though I'm sure I wouldn't."
"Nursing Home 2nd Experience","Kentucky","Haunted Places","So tonight, about 45 minutes or so ago, I was in a residents room, he was talking about how the lady above him wouldn't leave him alone and let him sleep. I asked what she looked like... (he described the same lady that my other residents described in my last post 😱)! I was trying to ease my mind and take his off of it, I looked up a couple times and yelled at ""her"" to leave him alone! I was in there for a good 10 minutes talking to him and listening to him talk about how ""she needs to be whacked upside the head"" lol. (I was changing him too) as all of this was happening it felt like the hair on top of my head was standing up, I was sooo creeped out, but didn't want him to know... I eventually said that I would get my angels to make her leave, and he smiled. Then I walked partly out of his room and watched him for a sec, he wouldn't take his eyes off ""her"" and then started to reach up like he was reaching for her, he held his hands like that for a few seconds. So I said really low while watching "" Lord please help this man, and make whatever he is seeing go away"" then left the room. 

I went to tend to another resident immediately after, then after I finished her, as I washed my hands, I noticed 3-4 scratches on my wrist, really red and whelping. I know I didn't scratch them, I would've known. I didn't feel it happen. They are still there, even now! I'm really really creeped out now! I was hoping it was him having an hallucination! 😳... 

Never had this happen before! Any suggestions?! Please, and thank you!

This happened shortly after my last post. I no longer work there. I also know I didn't scratch my self, and it wasn't from my hair tie. I have pictures."
"Nursing Home 1st Experience","Kentucky","Haunted Places","Hey y'all! I'm new to the group, and wanted to say Thanks for having me! I love reading your stories during my down time! I have one I'd like to share as well. 

I work in a nursing home. I have a resident who has had a lot of falls recently, so I was told to sit in the hall to his room. (There are two of us on each floor, so we each get a hall with about 10 residents.) I'm sitting there reading for a bit while it's quiet (I work 3rd shift), and I hear him talking. I'm thinking he's just talking in his sleep. Well a couple seconds later he pushes his call light, and I walk around the corner. 

Me: ""Hey Mr. *****, what can I do for ya?"" 

Him: ""Oh I don't know, what did that girl want that was just in here? She was just standing there starring at me, and wouldn't tell me what she needed.""

Me: ""Well, I'm sitting right outside in your doorway, I know that no one came in that I saw."" 

Him: ""Well I know I saw her there she was just looking at me, when I tried to talk to her."" 

Me: ""Hmm I don't know, I'll ask the other girl that's here with me if she came in, what did she look like?"" 

Him: ""Oh she had dark messed up hair, I don't know, her uniform was a bit different than yours though, she was kind of younger."" 

 (That night I had my hair in a tight bun, and the other girl never came to my side, plus she had blonde hair and it was tied up tight as well.) 

Me: "" Ok, well I'm going to sit back in your door way, and I'll make sure no one comes in, so you can sleep.""

Well... Even though I was creeped out, I thought it could've just been a hallucination or a dream. Except...! 

Later that night after I had told the girl I was working with what has happened... She came back and told me that, one of the residents on her side that she was tending to, told her that the girl in her room would not leave her alone, she had dark hair as well, and wouldn't leave even when she asked her too! 

Coincidence?

Lol just a little creeped out! 

If y'all made it this far, Thank You!

This was about 4 years ago, I no longer work there."
"My Amazing Mother-in-law","Ohio","Psychic / Medium","Not too many people have good things to say about their mother-in-laws, but mine was wonderful. Actually, Mary was like another Mother to me in many respects. She was so thrilled when John met me, and he introduced me to her about four days after we met on our first date.

Like I said in previous posts, John, and I clicked immediately. I could scarcely believe how 'much' alike we were. His mom was not home when John, and I met. However, he did want me to meet his mom. All he mentioned to her was that he met a woman that he wanted her to meet. He did not tell her much beyond that, but I learned the reasoning for that later on.

John picked me up from my parent's home. I had just left my first husband, Bill-the cheat, and liar (but that's another story-dangerous territory, lol!), and was living with them until I could find a place of my own. He took me to his house. It was the house on Erie Road. The one that was so terribly haunted. That house was my first post on here. However, I didn't notice anything untoward at the time since I was involved in a new relationship. That was my focus at the time.

I met Mary, and she instantly struck me as warm, and very outgoing. We sat down at the kitchen table for some coffee, and conversation. However, Mary said that I didn't even 'have' to 'tell' her anything about myself. She had the ability to read tea-leaves. She was born with a veil on her face, and she told me that was the reason she was psychic. She said her mother had the very same ability. It seemed to run in the female line of the family. You may wonder 'why' she mentioned this to a relative stranger upon first meeting, but I'll explain.

When I said John, and I were so much alike it was spooky-pardon the pun here-John, and I were very open with each other. I told him about my suspicions about the house he was residing in, and he was shocked that I 'knew' it was haunted. He told me that when he, and his sister, Beth, moved in a couple years ago, that slowly, but inexorably strange things began to take place once they got settled in. Beth was married, and moved out by the time I met him. We had some fascinating discussions about the paranormal.

 He was rather psychic on his mother's side. So, I guess he thought it was alright to let his mom know that I believed in that particular subject matter, but he didn't tell her anything else about me. Mainly because 'she' read his tea-leaves a few weeks 'before' he 'met' me, and she described me down to the last detail. She told him that he 'would' meet the right woman. He, like me, had a disastrous first marriage. His mom told him that 'we' would meet. It happened. Mary wanted me to drink a cup of tea, and she'd tell me what she saw about me from that cup.

Well, they boiled some water, and I gagged down a cup of tea-leaves, trying to keep the leaves from getting in between my teeth. Not too easy, let me tell you! When I was finished drinking it, she asked me to turn away from her while she read it. The reason for that was because she wanted to 'prove' that she was genuine. She said she met a phony psychic lady once. She said the woman merely 'read' a person's 'body language', and from that she merely played on the responses that she'd get. She wanted me to know that she was 'not' reading my reactions. I complied with her request.

She began telling me things about my family, and my past that I had 'not yet' confided to John about since we were just getting to learn about each other. She told me everything about my first husband, Bill. She hit the nail right on the head. I hadn't even let John know about what Bill put me through. She even told me that I was getting visitations from my grandmother, and gave me her physical description. I was, completely, blown away. 

John could see my eyes bulging out, but he managed to keep a straight stone-face somehow. She, also, told me that ""I"" was psychic, and how she knew that the house was haunted that they were in. She said she felt it the moment she moved in there.

She was divorced from her second husband, Tom. However, they still saw each other (more for the company, but the marriage didn't work out.), but she needed a place to live, and moved in with John, and Beth. After which Beth got married, and moved out.

I was simply blown away by Mary, and her genuine ability. She used to give readings when she was married to Tom to the neighborhood women. She 'never' charged for those readings. Not a penny. She did it whenever someone needed help. She helped the police a couple times to find missing children. 

I moved in after we dated for a couple weeks. John openly confessed that he loved me at first sight, but I told him we should live together first to make sure we really would get along. He agreed. However, my moving in sparked a string of paranormal events that began to drive us almost crazy. Mary was working in a factory, John was working in another place, and I was working in an office in Eastlake, Ohio.

We managed to pull our funds together, and after another couple years fled that awful house. I do mean fled. We didn't look back.

After we were moved out I continued to work in the office in Eastlake for about a year. We only had the one car, and John would drive me to work, go to his job, and pick me up later for us to go home. We were living in a mobile home then in West Park, Cleveland. The trip to, and from Eastlake got to be too much on the old car we had. So, I gave a three week notice to find work closer to home.

On the night before my last day at work, Mary, who was living with us for a while, read my leaves, and began laughing. We were sitting at the kitchen table drinking coffee, and she was on the living room couch. We asked what she was laughing at. She gleefully announced that the other office workers were going to throw 'me' a surprise party, and give me a gift of money. Now, 'that' I had trouble accepting. I told her that I didn't think that I was 'that' popular that they would throw 'me' a surprise party.

Once again, I was proven wrong. The next day I went into my office. The woman from the mail room next door came in, and asked me to come over to the mail room for a moment. I didn't question it. I just assumed that she had a project for me to help her with. Yikes! The moment I walked in the entire customer service department, the print shop, and half the factory shocked me with a big 'surprise'! Even the company president, and the rest of the administration was there. You could have knocked me over with a peanut. I never realized how much I was liked, and appreciated there. Wow! They had a cake, and a gift box. When I opened the box there was a red string of yarn that I pulled out. Guess what? They had several ten-dollar bills tied in little bows all along that string. Sixty dollars worth. Egad! Mary nailed it again.

I was overwhelmed amidst the hugs, and well wishes.

When John came to pick me up he could see the stunned look on my face. The first words out of his mouth were-""they gave you a surprise party. Didn't they?"". All I could do was nod. He said ""Mom told you so last night, honey!"". Yeah, she sure did.

Mary continued to amaze me even after John, and I moved to our own apartment. We kept in constant touch. She started getting to the point where she couldn't handle the trailer anymore by herself. Although John, and I went over often to help her out. She sold it, and moved in with her eldest daughter, Dee. She lived with her for a couple years before she passed on. She went peacefully in her sleep. I think of her often. John is with her now, as is his sister Dee. I miss them, and always think of them. I, honestly, think I 'feel' them around me in times of stress, or difficulty. I feel like 'they' keep me going somehow. At least 'that's' how I feel. Like I said, Mary was amazing, and I feel fortunate to have had such a special, and wonderful mother-in-law as her. Not to mention such a special husband. Thank you for reading!"
"Fascinated And Shook","Ohio","Misc","I just 'had' to submit this as it happened this past Tuesday on 2/6/2024.

 I was driving to the credit union early in the morning. I had just gotten off of work, and wanted to take care of a bill, and draw a little money out. The road I take is called Rocky River Drive. It takes me to Brookpark road which is right in front of Cleveland Hopkins Airport. I mention the airport for a reason.

I was going down the road when, of course, I hit a red light. I'm sitting there, and glance up to the sky. I do that frequently since I'm accustomed to aircraft going overhead. Oh, yeah! I saw a jet. Blue body with a red, blue, and yellow tail. However, it was 'completely' motionless. Just hanging there, and 'not moving'. Also, there was no noise. Now usually jets make that unmistakable sound, but 'this' was absolutely silent. I did a double - no 'triple'-take. I could not believe that it wasn't moving at all. If I had been on the roof of one of the houses I could've thrown a stone at it. So, it was close enough for me to observe.

Apparently the other people around me noticed it, too. The woman in the car next to me grabbed her smart phone, and placed it on the dash to get a shot of it, and I saw the guy in the car behind me doing the same with his cell phone. Unfortunately 'my' trac phone was zipped up in my purse, and turned off at the time. I had no time to retrieve it. On top of that, I was in traffic, and the light changed. I 'had' to proceed when the light turned green. I couldn't possibly block traffic.

I went to the credit union slightly shook from what I, and others saw, but I had to calm down. It's not too good to drive in a shaken state, I assure you. On the way back it was gone.

I have seen things like what I saw on a show called 'Paranormal Caught on Camera' on the Travel channel. However, I viewed those videos with a certain amount of skepticism. I thought it was all brilliant C.G.I... They, now, have my profound apologies. If I hadn't actually witnessed it along with the other drivers (I didn't notice any side-walk traffic at the time), I wouldn't have believed it. I have 'tried' to rationalize this away, but cannot seem to come up with a scientific explanation for it. Sorry, folks!

Has this happened to anyone else on this site? If so, PLEASE tell me about it, and what 'you' might have for an explanation. I'm not to sure about the 'glitch in the matrix' line of thought, but nonetheless, I cannot explain it. I'm still a little bum-fuzzled over it. Not to mention, still a bit shook up. Thanks for any input in advance!"
"The Shadow I Saw At A Hotel I Was At","Arizona","Haunted Places","Last month I was staying in a hotel and I couldn't sleep. I went to sleep at 1am and as I was waking up, I saw a shadow peeking from the bathroom and I decided to use the toilet. 

Although I saw a shadow there peeking from the bathroom I just used it because I really needed to use it 

As I turned off the light, I see a shadow in the mirror in front of my hotel bed then it vanished and my sibling woke up then said ""what did you see?"" 

I was like ""nothing"" because I didn't wanted to scare my sibling so I went back to sleep and so did she. 

In the morning, I woke up and remembered the shadow. I ran to the truck while my sibling gets ready to leave the hotel room packing our stuff. She was weirded out on why I ran off like that but I am not sure when I should tell her what I saw.

The hotel room gave me weird, creepy, bad vibe and it might've been a demon that I saw. It was the first encounter I had with a demon. 

I mean it could've been a spirit but that was scary and I am not sure how I went to sleep after that night. I heard tales where demons tend to stay at places where it feels the most creepy and scary. 

I also haven't told my sibling about the shadow I saw that night. The reason why I think it's haunted by a shadow is because think it has something to do with the fact that there was a mirror in front of her bed. I heard many stories that it's dangerous to sleep in front of mirrors. 

I mean I am proud that I used the bathroom after I saw that shadow like it's something I would never do after watching so many horror movies about demons and ghosts."
"The Auto Bus Ghost Girl","Arkansas","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","Last month I was traveling and I decided to come back by a public bus like a auto bus where it travels to other states. It was apparently a luxury bus. It was the 2nd day of being in the bus and I was getting ready to sleep as it was a long drive and we were in the middle of the desert, I know how the passengers look and were like so here's what happened; 

I dozed off and went to sleep, and when I woke up, I see this little girl with glasses and blonde hair and it looked like a younger version of a friend I have, also she wasn't one of the passengers. She was peeking her head from the seat in front of me and was looking at the windows outside, and then she lowered her head back down. Now I went back to sleep, this bus doesn't picked new passengers, it just drives to your location. And when the bus stops for a restaurant break so that we can eat, the little girl I saw was nowhere to be seen. 

The only person was in the seat in front of me was just someone who wasn't a little and another man.

Since the bus doesn't stop for new passengers the little girl that I saw was a spirit. There were not a lot of kids in the bus and only young adults and older adults, and before the encounter, there was no passenger that looked like her. 

I was so shocked like I should've caught it on camera but it went so quick, the fact that there was no one on front of me except for a man that was sitting there and the fact that it looked like my friend."
"The Hangry Ghost, Strange Sounds And The Shadow Hand","South Carolina","Shadow People","These first couple of events happened a few years ago at work. I should have included them in my previous story about the hospital, but they were so minor I forgot about them until a few days ago so I figured I'd include them here to help pad out the character limit for the actual story at the end.

The first one happened when I was having a rather rough night; running the moment I got in the door. When I finally got a chance to sit down I went up to the second floor waiting area in the front lobby. I hadn't been sitting there long when I heard a soft *thud* from the nearby vending machine. Curious, I got up to look and found that a Snickers bar had randomly fell into the retrieval area. I opened the door and took out the bar with a little trepidation. Feeling a little uncomfortable about the whole thing I left the bar on the counter in front of the coffee maker, but ended up coming back later and grabbing it because I wanted chocolate.

The second happened about 3 times over the years.

When I was cleaning a room, either as a discharge or waxing the floor, the callbox on the wall would suddenly start spitting static and emitting random tones like it was shorting out or something, only for it to stop a minute or two later. I don't recall if there was any voices or anything of note as I really didn't pay it much attention each time it happened since this hospital was pretty much thrown together in less than a year so things going screwy wasn't all that unexpected. It was just really odd for it happen so randomly in different rooms at different times and then stop like nothing was wrong.

The last incident happened a couple of months ago at home on my night off.

It was some time between 4:30am and 5am when I was about to go to bed. I wanted to get something to eat before bed because I was getting hungry and if I slept while hungry I'd wake with a bad headache. Going to the kitchen to see what there was to eat (a bowl of leftover potato soup), I turned around to face the back wall of house with a window directly in front of me, and sliding glass door to the right of that, both facing the back yard. That's when I noticed something moving on the floor. 

It was a shadow swaying back and forth in the light cast through the back door and under the dining room table. It took a few seconds for my brain to process what it was I thought I was seeing. It looked like the shadow of a hand swaying in the breeze like you would do if you stuck your arm out of a car window and let it flow with the air current. At first I didn't want to believe it was actually the shadow of a hand I was seeing until it turned for a few seconds into a flowing sort of waving pattern where I could see all the fingers spread out before it turned back to it's original position. It was a small hand like a woman's and moving elegantly. It was also just the hand and wrist, nothing more.

Surprisingly I wasn't overly freaked out by this, just a bit intrigued. Looking under the table to see if I could see the source (there was nothing, naturally) and also noting that there was an unusual amount of light coming through the windows the entire time this was going on. We do have a light in the back corner of the yard up on a power pole, but even after the city changed the crap bulb that was in it it still barely illuminated the corner it's in. At first I thought it might have been moonlight from a full moon, but then I realized that around that time in the morning the moon would have been behind the tree line of our wooded hill as our house faces East so the moon would have been close to setting by then. It was also odd that the light had a particular green color to it as well.

This whole encounter must've went on for around 10-15 minutes or so, when I kind of got bored and just decided to focus on eating. I turned facing towards the front of the house into the kitchen, finished the soup and deposited the bowl onto the counter by the sink and by the time I turned around again the shadow was gone and the normal amount of ambient light was coming through the window.

I don't know if this thing was trying to entice me to come over and open the door or something, but I guess it couldn't hold a candle to the allure of home made potato soup. That being said, not 2 minutes after the show was over I was just about to head back to my room when there was a loud *crack* sounding against the wall between the window and door like a rock had been thrown against the siding. Scared the crap out of my poor cat Luna who jumped and stared in that direction.

Also to note, while I was looking for a source for the shadow I noticed that, for it to be in the position it was in, whatever was casting had to have been upside down. Which was what I thought was the weirdest part. I didn't go anywhere near the door the whole time either. I may have been intrigued, but I wasn't going to be stupid about it."
"The Senior Nursing Facility","Ohio","Family / Friends Visits","This particular incident happened within the last year, and it just occurred to me to post it. I worked for eighteen years as a Medic. After that time period it was beginning to take a toll on my back (there are more back injuries in the EMS field than 'any' other occupation.). After I withdrew from working with an ambulance squad I did home nursing care for four years until I got hired where I am, working now.

I am, now, a full-time Receptionist in a senior nursing facility (not mentioning the name-it's a state-wide organization) that has Independent Living, Assisted Living, Skilled Nursing, and Memory Care all within one location. We offer a very wide range of services for the elderly.

I work in the independent living area, which is also the main entrance, and the main switchboard to route calls to the appropriate areas. It's located in Westlake, Ohio. The particular road it's on is called nursing home strip due to the fact that there's a long line of nursing homes stretching from Rocky River to Westlake.

The area I work in is manned twenty four hours, seven days/week, three-hundred sixty-five days/year.

 My medical background is what attracted my supervisor's attention when she spotted my resume' on Indeed. She called me. We set up an interview for the next day. I went there, and met her. She seemed very impressed that I was a former medic because there do arise medical emergencies in independent living as there are elderly residents living there. She wanted someone that could address those incidents in a timely manner, but keep a cool head whilst evaluating the situation. I seemed to fit the bill. Unbeknownst to me, I was hired after I left her office. She called the next day to send me to an Urgent Care Office to get a physical. I passed. Yay!

The residents that live there were quick to spot a new face at the front desk. They would introduce themselves, and inquire about my name, and the like. They are all very sweet. I really like working there. I seem to have an affinity for working with the elderly. I'm good at it, and I really enjoy helping people. That is why I went into the medical field in the first place. I enjoy helping people.

You simply cannot help but get close to those residents after seeing, and addressing their needs day in, and day out. I'm not an emotionless robot. I'm a person, and I have feelings for them. It's too hard not to. We are to the point that we are like an extended 'family' to them. 

They're wonderful!

This one little lady, Ruthie, was quick to familiarize herself with me. She was especially excited when she found out from another coworker that I was a retired medic. She told me that she was a former Registered Nurse who used to be the head nurse in a downtown hospital in Cleveland. She was delighted. We had some very enjoyable conversations swapping our medical exploits. She loved talking to me, but she was respectful of the times when I was busy. Like when I did the evening dinner/welfare checks. She would wait until I was done with them, and come back down to the desk around 8:00 at night so she could visit with me. She would, then, bid me a 'good night', and go back to her apartment to get ready for bed by 9:00.

We got very close in the first three years I was there. I met her children, grandchildren, nieces, and nephews. They came to see her to take her out frequently. Unfortunately, after those three years, she began to decline. She was in her late eighties, and had several health issues that were getting worse. I hated seeing that happen to her, but it happens to a lot of them that reside there. She went from walking on her own to a walker, and then a motorized scooter.

Eventually she wound up over in the skilled nursing facility. She was there for a couple months, and her family would visit her regularly.

After those two months she passed on during a day off that I had. When I got back to work the day receptionist informed me of what happened to her. I went into the employee restroom, and cried. I pulled myself together by reminding myself that she was in a far better place now with her husband, and other loved ones, and no longer suffering. However, I still missed seeing, and talking to her. I thought of her often.

It was several months later that I was working the evening shift. I was doing my dinner/welfare checks. Those that I called that didn't answer their phones I had to physically go check on. Her apartment was rented to a new resident that I had to check on as he did not come down to dinner, none of the other employees had 'seen' him, and he didn't answer the phone when I called. I gathered up my equipment-cordless phone, pager, paper, pen, and master key to enter the apartment if need be. I knocked on the door of #115. No answer. I let myself in. I called out that it was me, and proceeded to do a sweep of all the rooms. He wasn't home. As I was leaving the bedroom, and coming back into the living room, there on the couch, as plain as day, was Ruthie. She was sitting there looking as robust as ever. She had a broad smile on her face, and she smiled, and waved in recognition of me. I was overwhelmed. I said ""Ruthie. It's wonderful to see you. I miss you!"". After I said that she grinned again, and gave me a little wink. Then she raised her hand to wave at me again, and then she faded away. I got a little emotional, and had to choke back the tears. I thought I was just hallucinating for a moment, and went about finishing my checking rounds.

Once I returned to the desk, I had time to sit, and evaluate what just happened. I wasn't about to tell my fellow workers about it for fear of them thinking that I was either, two short of a six-pack, or possibly, scaring them. I kept it to myself. Yet, I had to ponder about it.

I know what I saw. Was it possible that she just came back to see me one last time, and assure me that she was alright now? That was the only theory that made any sense to me.

Funny thing though. The other evening/night-shift women that work the desk told me that, for 'some strange reason', whenever 'they' did the welfare checks in 'that' apartment, that it always felt extremely cold in there. I didn't notice any difference in temperature when ""I"" went in there. Now I have to ask, was Ruthie just staying around, and 'waiting' for me to come on duty to make the rounds so she could make herself known to me? I didn't see her anymore after that. Almost wish I would, but I realize she's much better off now.

I am continuing to develop close relationships with the other residents living there. We even have a couple local famous people living there. However, out of respect for their privacy, I won't give their names. 

I am something of a senior myself (I admit it!). My age is another thing that was in my favor when my boss hired me. She appreciated my background, and experience due, largely, to my age. I, personally, cannot afford to 'retire' as it were. I 'have' to keep working. One of these mornings after I've pulled the third shift, someone will come in, and find my corpse sitting behind the desk, in front of the computer. Actually, that's not such a bad way to go. Performing my duty, lol!

Seriously though, I enjoy the work I do. However, I never expected the added bonus of seeing a resident that I grew very fond of who passed on, showing up to smile, and wave to me. I am very grateful that I met Ruthie, and feel I'm all the 'better' for having know her. Since it is a senior facility I work in I'm sure I have other encounters waiting for me! Thanks for reading!"
"What Did The Dog See?","Texas","Pets / Animals","This is incident happened to me when I was about 17 years old, around 1980, give or take. Timelines start running together as one grows older, but the details of this story are as fresh as the afternoon it happened. 

My father, being in the military, was stationed at the large Air Force Base in San Antonio, TX at the time. My parents had purchased an older house, in a long-established neighborhood close to the base. Over the four plus years we lived there, there seemed to be some strange occurrences that happened off and on. To set up the foundation of the story I will highlight a couple of things that happened that lead up to my ""interesting"" experience some 42+ years ago. On a side note, there is supposedly some history surrounding the old neighborhood i.e. The land was a field hospital for the Mexico Army from the siege of the Alamo but perhaps that is just a story (?). 

The garage to the house was converted to a play/living room by the previous owners but my parents wanted to turn it into a bedroom for my younger sister who was 5 at the time. She walked into the large room, took one look around and stated she would not sleep in the room. When my mother asked why, she pointed to the back corner of the room and said a man hanged himself there. Then she left the room.

 Other things that happened include a woman that seemed to visit my other sister in her sleep regularly. One night when my parents where in bed, a large crashing sound emanated from the kitchen like all the cabinets flew open with all the dishes crashing to the floor. When my parents when to investigate nothing was amiss.

 Other times books would open on their own in front of people and for me only two real things stand out. One was I awoke from a very sound sleep by something and as I was waking up I saw a solid black figure standing/bending by the head of my bed. Needless to say I was instantly awake and swinging my pillow at it. By the time I was fully awake nothing was there. I can never be sure if that is what I saw or just want I imaged as I woke up but something caused me to come out of a sound sleep.

We had two dogs that were very protective of the family. One was full Chow (the mother named Jess) and the other was half Chow (her son named PT). PT was well known in the neighborhood as a very aggressive watch dog for the house, family, and back yard. Occasionally he would escape from the back yard but he would be happy go lucky as he only protected his ""property"", his ""family"". He was a very aggressive dog within his boundaries. Case in point, my father tried to give him to the AF for a K9 working dog, but they refused as he as too aggressive. Like all outside dogs, when they both came in the house, they were very happy and anytime the door was open they would not hesitate to run into the house if invited, for scratches and snacks. This is very important to keep in mind for the upcoming incident. 

One early afternoon in the summer I was home alone and like most teenagers on the weekend with not much to do, I was just lying on the couch eyeing the TV. I could not even tell you what was on but I do remember that the house was very still (not something I noticed then but looking back after it happened) and quiet with just the TV providing the sound. All of a sudden there was a huge sharp bang on the back door with PT barking and hitting the door again and again wanting to come in. They had never done this before and in fact, having enjoyed the company of a number of pet dogs, I had never seen this type of behavior before or since. My initial thought was someone was breaking in at the back of the house through the window, but we had bars on the windows (remember this is San Antonio) so if someone was breaking in I should have heard them, plus it was early afternoon. That was my young reasoning at the time. 

So, I opened the back door and PT ran past me without even looking my way, not even stopping for a pat or snack, just zoomed by me to the front of the hallway. Jess was on the back porch whimpering and running in a circle, again I had never seen this behavior before. PT had run around the corner to the top of the hallway leading to the back bedrooms/bathroom when I heard him growling like a bear, deep and menacing. I tried to get Jess to come into the house, figuring two dogs is better than one but she refused, and I could not even pull her inside the house, as she locked up her legs and refused to move. Hearing PT growling but not barking I carefully made my way to the kitchen wall so I could peek around the corner to see what was going on, figuring the back door was open if I needed to run and dog was between me and whoever/whatever was in the hallway. I looked down the hallway and there was nothing I could see but I did notice it was quiet (except for the continuous growling) and it was darker in the hallway, like a gloomy day but only outside the sun was shining bright. 

PT was standing there with all the hair on this back straight up and his tail straight back. I did not know what was going on but in either an act of bravery or stupidly (I was a teenager so it could go either way or a little bit of both) I walked up to PT again figuring he would protect me if something came down the hallway. I called him and he would only glance at me as he had to keep watch on whatever he saw. I tried to pat him and he paid no mind to my hand other to take a quick look to ensure it was my hand. I then preceded to walk down the hallway looking in the two bedrooms on the side, the bathroom and the bedroom at the end. Everything looked fine, did not see any broken glass or anyone for that matter and did not notice any cold spots, touching, etc. In the past the dogs loved to come back to the bedrooms to play and get petted but PT refused to come down the hallway at all, even after I called him, he seemed to be looking straight through me. He just kept still at the front of the hall, with his legs in a ready to attack stance and the deep, from the belly, growling. I tried to grab PT's collar and drag him down the hallway which he fought by digging his paws into the rug, he just locked his legs but kept right on looking pass me at whatever he saw. When I called him and tried to pull him, PT would give me quick glance perhaps a hard plead to leave him alone and get out of there quickly.

So deciding that it might be time to head to the great outdoors and wait for the rest of the family to return I started towards the kitchen and open back door when all of a sudden the dog quit growling. I looked back and it looked like he came out of a trance, he shook his head side to side and looked down the hallway. He then became the happy go lucky dog he was, wagging his tail and wanting a scratch. At the same time Jess came into the house as always-like nothing was wrong, nothing happened. But as a final period to this story as PT started to walk away from the hallway, he stopped and looked back down the hallway, which seemed to be not as dark, gave a hard deep growl that lasted a few seconds, and did the things that dogs do when covering up something bad, he used his back legs to kick out down the hallway like he was throwing dirt down that way. Both dogs were their playful self.

I am not sure what happened and I never been one to pick up on that kind of thing but I can say that was the strangest thing that had ever happened to me until my young daughter was having conversations with something in the corner of our room one night in Korea but that is another story. Never again did anything happen like that again while we were in the house. Just a strange happening and sometimes I ponder about what might have happened if the ""protector"" dogs had not been there... Nothing I would have noticed but..."
"Thinning The Veil","Missouri","Family / Friends Visits","My Dad was an independent owner operator for 41 years. He, I and his Mom, my Grandma Vada were very close. So close, in fact, we knew what the other was thinking without even asking. I call it being ""akin"" to somebody.

 So my Dad falls out of his truck in 2010, breaks his neck, is a quadriplegic for 6 months and dies 03/31/2011. Just DESTROYED me.

A few months later, I'm asleep... I think...and, I never have dreams I remember... But THIS dream... I can SMELL cigarettes and diesel...I'm in a garden-a BEAUTIFUL garden with color and fragrances so VIVID...I've never felt SO ALIVE! And there's my daddy... Sitting not 3 ft from me. I instantly just knew he was ok. And he looks me right in my eyes all serious like and WITHOUT OPENING HIS MOUTH, says, 

""Kerri, I LOVE YOU."" And I was awake. Crying! Shook up.

Next night, I'm sitting around with my friend, Jerree and this overwhelming compulsion to tell Jerree to go see her dad in Oklahoma won't let me alone until I say it to her. So I did. Her dad passed the next day.

Another day, I'm at some friend's house and everybody goes downstairs to play pool, except here comes this overwhelming compulsion to stay seated, alone at the kitchen table. Then in comes this horrible dude I can't stand-he goes on downstairs, but his driver-a guy I had never met, sits down across from me. This overwhelming thing makes me say, ""You look like you just saw a ghost!"" And the dude bolts and leaves!

Two weeks later, that guy finds my house and tells me that that day he met me, right before that, him and Roger, we'll call him, were at a truck stop getting gas. Supposedly a long time ago there was a murder Roger was involved in and no one was left alive EXCEPT Roger to tell anything. Well, while pumping gas, a stranger walked up to Roger and began giving him DETAILS ABOUT THE MURDER! Roger said, ""Who the f*** are you and what do you want from me?"" The stranger said they were (the murder victims name) reincarnated. Then they drove to where I was and I said, ""You look like you just saw a ghost."" 

At this point I think I'm losing my mind. I throw people out of my house for talking crazy like this! About a month later I have my daddy's 38 Special in my mouth, about to pull the trigger when... Here it comes, this overwhelming compulsion to put the gun down and pick up my Dads old 12 string Eko Ranger. I never put that guitar down and learned it in 4 months. Bizarre. An Indian told me that my dad and I were spiritually connected and when he passed, the veil had thinned for me. I believe that."
"Room 113","Idaho","Haunted Places","We were watching the news one night and they were showing the Twin Falls all lit up with changing lights in Twin Falls Idaho and we decided to go. It is almost 2 hours away, so wife books a room at a dog friendly motel and wait for our day to go.

 Me, wifey and year-old pup hit the road and it is a great drive all the way there and we're jacked to be going to the falls. We roll into Twin Falls, locate our motel, get to our room and unload our stuff. This room is really nice, and all looks brand new.

 We go outside walk around building. Other dogs are also going in and out and we hear yelling, and a Mexican restaurant next door is really hopping, and people are taking presents into front door area there. 

 Wife says she wants a margarita, and she heads to the restaurant's front door, myself and pup head to front of building to grass and main drag and traffic zipping by.

 We just kill time now to almost dark and ask directions to the falls at front desk, which are nearby. We get to the falls area, and it is so busy we had to pull over and are told when we can drive down to the falls, and it is tight and winding road down to the parking area. It seems a credit union is lighting up the falls it is very cool where we are standing, we are looking at very top area of falls and water crashing way below us and well worth the drive to finally see the falls and when we feel we have wandered around enough, and we head back to our motel room.

 We are laying on bed now, puppy in the middle just below pillows and we are playing with our little guy and wifey says she has to go to front desk and discuss our bill. We ordered 2 rooms somehow, anyway she leaves the room and I am on the left side of bed and really close to the edge and puppy is in middle of bed and I am messing with him giggling and just enjoying his playful grunts and bites when all of a sudden the mattress is being lifted right behind me maybe 4 times and it is like waves hitting your boat sideways and really noticeable. I am on my side with my elbow on the bed and my hand holding up my head and I quickly look behind me and nothing there. I would say it was around 10 pm and the lights are on. When my wife returns, I tell her something was rocking me and the mattress and again now I am right around 205 lbs and this mattress is a very tall one, not easily grabbed let alone lift with me right next to edge. Well, we get ready for bed thankful for a great day in this small town and we hit the hay.

 Around 3.30 am wife wakes me up by moving around and says ""something is moving the bed over here"", and she sounds a little miffed and we just fell back asleep.

 When I went for coffee in the morning, I told the front desk person what had happened last night, and he said that's never happened here as far as I know? When I go for breakfast, there is a table full of uniformed motel workers at least 6 Hispanic ladies and I ask them if they had any issues in room 113 and a couple of them shook their heads no.

 I lifted mattress up and it was small spring and metal band system, and I took pictures of it, always debunking. This is a great bed system the lower sides are painted steel a very tall bed and I could see the floor past the metal webbing. It was a Sealey mattress that looked new. Before writing this yesterday I called the motel with the wife's help and ask the lady that answered if the mattress shaker had bothered anyone else and she said I have worked here quite a while and never heard of this happening before. I hung up and thought well I told your front desk and a table full of workers, so somebody has heard of this before.

 Well, I have wondered if the bed spring system had something to do with it but being a metal fabricator most of my life, I really doubt it just from our weights. This was March 2022. Good luck out there."
"Disturbing Audio Evidence","Massachusetts","Ghost Hunting","I'd like to start off by saying that I am a fan of this website. Seeing there was a recent update in the town I grew up in, I had to dive in. I researched a bit and eventually, my girlfriend and I decided we had to check it out for ourselves. I don't intend to bore you, reader, with my background or my girlfriend's but it is important to add that I grew up in Upton for my entire life, she grew up in Mendon, Upton's neighbor. Upton is one odd town and there are stories to support the purported notion that Upton is indeed ""creepy"", as the author before me stated. 

Last bit of important background that is needed for full context. My girlfriend is spiritual, a powerful empath and I would describe her as ""in-tune"" with spirits of various kinds. I am a skeptic, albeit a believer in ""ghosts"", however I will go lengths to disprove what I think I have found. Together, we have investigated spots around Massachusetts and have plans to explore different areas. We have aspirations to start our own trade for hire, but would prefer to gain more experience in this particular ""trade"". Enough of all of that, let me add onto the mysterious being on Mechanic Street in Upton, Massachusetts.

At approximately 1:00am, on December 9th, we arrived at Mechanic Street. We decided to try to reenact the story we read, and what we have heard from others. We drove from route 140, turned onto Mechanic Street, and paid specific attention to where reported sightings took place. ""A woman wearing a 'colonial dress', lacking facial features, appearing to float and follow vehicles driving by"". We drove this route roughly 3 times. The first time with no radio on, the second with a radio on, and the third time we decided to park. We did not experience any radio interference or electrical phenomenon. 

Knowing this area, I knew that Fowler Road had space to park on the side of the road. We parked and on foot, approached the intersection. Utilizing a sound recorder, electromagnetic field detector and a thermal camera, we at this time did not find anything significant enough to define as concerning. It was at this time, my girlfriend felt a ""pull"" down Fowler road, specifically to the front side of my car, to the bridge over the small brook. This is where our investigation took a turn from uneventful to unexplainable. 

Through prior investigations, when my girlfriend feels strongly about an area, I will stay behind and utilize our tools. I began noticing spikes on my sound recorder's ""scale"". She was adamant that our hotspot was this bridge. I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand up, that intuitive ""someone is staring at me"" feeling. I went back to the car, went to turn it on and noticed my battery stuttered, the first time this has happened. It was cold out, a possible explanation, however a very suspect one. I began listening to audio, I could hear what sounded like puzzling whispering. Incomprehensible, but very much enough to make me want to go back out. Before that however, I noticed my girlfriend running back to the car, a big grin on her face I could see in my headlights, but still running.

""She thinks we are idiots for staying here"", she told me. I am a skeptic, but over our investigations, I know that she is truthfully in-tune and I take her word every time. I informed her about the inaudible whispers. We decided to drive down to Honey Farms... That is now ""Family Farms"", which is just disappointing to a hometown kid such as myself, but a break was needed. We then drove back to Mechanic Street for one more run, a last chance to see what we could find. Whispers and a strong intuitive vibe may be meaningful to us, but of course more was needed. We got what we were looking for, more than we could have expected.

We both parked, I left my car running to avoid potential issues with my car and we went back to the bridge. My girlfriend had a mental image of a man with a wide grin, a large top hat, and a tuxedo of sorts. Interesting enough to stay on my mind enough to repeat it as I decided to walk into the woods, to the brook. With my audio recorder, and my eyes on the ""scale"" that measures decibels, I decided to be more vocal. 

When I arrived at my destination, at the edge of the brook, I said, ""a man in a top hat... How long have you been here?"" about 5 seconds later, the scale went into the red, which means it is something loud enough to hear clearly. 

I did not hear anything, but seeing that made me stop recording to play it back. I stood in the same spot and played it back. Loudly, clearly, and in a voice I still do not know how to describe, ""a long time"". My instincts came in and I yelled to my girlfriend, ""CAR, NOW!"" and got right in. My girlfriend was testing a ""spirit box"" on her cell phone, and no, not a free prank app. I played her the audio as her app rang static, her reaction to the voice I recorded followed by her phone saying, ""it's outside"", was enough for me to drive off of Fowler Road to Warren Street. Both of us, unsure of how to exactly feel, barely spoke. We listened to the audio I have recorded a few times over and decided we have epic evidence.

Our theory, prior to further research: A woman had a tragic event by or in this brook at the hands of a man who potentially wore a top hat. Combining my girlfriend's intuitive deciphering of her feelings for paranormal presence and mental images with me mentioning a man in a top hat and receiving such a strong response, indicates there is a strong connection between this unknown man and this woman who has been witnessed at this intersection. We believe the strongest location is on the bridge over the brook on Fowler road. From here, we do believe this woman's lack of ""facial features"" could be the result of what happened to her, possibly at the hands of this unidentified man. 

As I write this, it has only been a matter of hours since we returned home. I will continue to review our ""technical"" evidence to see if there is more that was missed. However, at this point we would state that this location has strong evidence of paranormal activity. We suggest other paranormal investigators, ghost hunters and others to check this area out. There are homes in this area, and I would remind potential paranormal researchers to be mindful of that."
"The Old Maternity Hospital Part 2","Ohio","Haunted Places","This is a continuation of my last post regarding a very old maternity hospital, built in 1902, and was operated by the Salvation Army named after their founder, William Booth. The hospital operated until it closed in 1991. I worked there as a housekeeper in 1977. 

They, apparently, had a female ghost that resided in the basement of the facility. A fellow employee, Trish, is the one who told me about it.

We had a brief encounter in the basement while trying to find some paper towels to stock the utility room upstairs. The ghost brought a case of them down off a shelf that was so high up that neither of us could even see them. Therefore, this woman ghost 'helped' us locate exactly what we were trying to find. We thanked her. After that episode we didn't seem to hear, or see her again. Possibly she finally moved on.

Kitty corner behind the hospital was the unwed mothers home that housed the girls/women until they had their babies. The home was primarily where the S.A. Personnel worked. They ran the offices, made the meals, taught school courses, and did job-training for the girls.

I used to go outside sometimes for my lunch break and walk around to unwind before going back on duty. On some of those occasions I would be looking at the home. I would notice an older woman come out of the side onto the concrete stairwell outside of the building. She would then descend the steps and go over to little brick out building that housed old furniture, and what have you. She wore the traditional navy blue uniform with a blue cap on her head that the S.A. Personnel wore.

I never gave any thought to it. I knew that the salvation army personnel operated and worked over there. So no big deal. I 'thought' it was no big deal. She looked rather matronly with her graying hair pinned back. She always seemed focused on doing a specific task. She didn't even notice me standing in front of the building, and I saw no reason to disturb her from whatever she had to do.

Trish and I were on the hospital's second floor cleaning one time. A couple S.A. Captains came walking through chatting with the nurses, asking about how many beds were occupied. How the nurseries were doing. If there was anything they were needing that they could order for the stations. That kind of thing. After talking to them they gravitated over to Trish, and me. They were very polite. They asked us how we were doing? Did we like working there? Pretty much just casual small talk after which they departed to go to another area in the facility.

We still had more work to do though. We entered the nurses lounge to begin cleaning in there. Trish did the waste baskets while I cleaned the restroom, and we both began dusting the lockers and mopping the floors. 

We were having a conversation about the facility, and the other floor we had left to clean. I wondered why we never had to go to the home in back of the hospital to clean over there. Trish told me that the girls/women that reside there are responsible for doing that, so we were not required over there.

Neither Trish nor I had ever been 'in' the home, but we wondered about it in our conversation. I told her about the uniformed lady that I kept seeing over there. About that time one of the nurses came in to retrieve an item from her locker. She overheard me describing the lady I kept seeing. She got a funny expression on her face, and went over to the door and closed it. She, then, introduced herself to Trish and I. She inquired about the lady I was talking about. I told her what I'd noticed frequently about the woman. How she comes out of the building down outside step, and goes into the little brick out building. I described her to this nurse who began getting a little pale.

She told me that 'she' had seen this woman periodically. So what was the big deal? The following is the conversation relating to this woman that we saw. This is where it got interesting and a little bit scary.

Nurse: Did you ever notice the 'side door' of the home open, or close when that woman walked out?

Me: Uhhhhhhhh! Now that you mention it. I don't think I have.

Nurse: Did you ever 'see' her walk through a door on the side of the out building she went into.

Me: Ummmmmmmmm! I don't recall seeing her open a door to go inside.

Nurse: It took me a while before I noticed those seemingly innocuous little details, but once I took note of 'what' I was 'seeing' it dawned om me that I was seeing something far from normal.

She told us that she was embarrassed to discuss it with her co-workers so she did some research on her own. She knew a nurse that regularly worked over in the home. She asked questions, but was trying not to sound ridiculous. Apparently, the nurse that worked over there figured out what the questions were leading to. This other nurse confided in her that she was seeing Sister Doris. Suddenly the inquisitive nurse felt a bit sheepish. So, she was seeing a lady that works there. The reply she received just about floored her. The other nurse told her that Sister Doris had passed on over 50 years ago. Her picture was on the hall wall inside as one of the 'dedicated salvation army personnel that devoted her life to the well-being of those who enter here.'

In other words. She was really seeing the ghost of Sister Doris, and so was I. She told her that sister Doris was a Saintly, and kind woman.

She never bothers, or hurts anyone. In fact, they were very fond of Sister Doris. Say what? 

I could scarcely believe what I was hearing. That they didn't mind sharing the home with a ghost. According to the nurse we were talking to, she said the unwed home nurse told her that sister Doris is extremely helpful over there. Sometimes, she straightens out the beds for the girls/women, or they'd get done doing laundry and leave to gather more only to come back and see sheets, towels, and what have you neatly folded. Some of the girls were even comforted by sister Doris a few times not realizing she was non-corporeal. Of course, the people working over there weren't about to 'tell' them. Sister Doris would go outside to bring in extra supplies that were needed inside the home. The little brick out building was once where the supplies were stored. Sister Doris often volunteered to go out there to bring in whatever was needed quite often. She was the type of woman that always went above and beyond in everything she did. What a lady.

When the nurse got done telling us this all I could say was

""Apparently, the good Sister Doris wished to remain in her capacity as a care-giver, and comforter."" She wanted to continue serving a needful purpose even in the afterlife. They agreed with that scenario. I commented how very solid and real she appeared. I admit that was 'my' first experience seeing a solid looking, full-bodied apparition.

I worked there for 2 years and saw Sister Doris sporadically until I secured a better job elsewhere, but I wasn't alarmed at seeing her anymore. She was a fine lady. 

I never confided those incidents to Bill. He was the type that wouldn't really believe it unless he 'saw' it with his own eyes. Even then, he would be a bit of a sceptic. I maintain a practical sense of rationale in regard to what I have encountered. I will evaluate all the logical possibilities before I concede that something is truly paranormal. Once you eliminate the logical, then what remains is beyond logic and should just be accepted as such. There is an unseen world around us if we only acknowledge it. Something to think about. That concludes this account. Thanks for reading!"
"The Old Maternity Hospital","Ohio","Haunted Places","This particular account took place in the mid to late 1970's. I was still a relatively newlywed to my first husband, Bill. Bill worked on and off, but 'mostly' off. Therefore, I 'had' to work. I found employment as a Nurse Aide in a fairly large hospital (leaving out the name) in Willoughby, Ohio. I started there in 1974 and worked until 1977. We had moved from our first apartment (due to the fact that it was haunted) to a very nice apartment in Euclid. However, having moved further away made it harder to commute to my job. So, I had to secure new employment closer to our new residence making it easier to transit back and forth.

I found work in another hospital called Booth Memorial Hospital (it, no longer exists.) They didn't have any openings for nurse aides, but needed housekeepers. I figured, I'm not too proud. Work is work, and a paycheck is a paycheck. They hired me. I started there in the latter part of '77'. 

Let me supply a little background on this hospital. It originally opened as a charity maternity hospital in 1902 and was expanded upon in 1904. They also opened a Home for Unwed Mothers in 1907 that was operated with the hospital. It was called Booth Hospital at first, and the unwed mothers home was separate and built slightly adjacent to it on the right side of it behind the hospital. The hospital's name officially changed in 1923 to Booth Memorial Hospital. It was named after William Booth, the founder of the Salvation Army, who operated the facility.

It was originally a small hospital having only 54 beds when first opened, but when I went to work there in 1977, it had 3 floors, and about 100 beds by then. Low-income families could, also, go there to have their babies, and they could temporarily house the husbands, and other children of the women patients thus allowing them to be close by.

The unwed mothers home had 3 floors. The girls living there were expected to do chores to earn their keep. They, also, were given education, and job-training in the event that they decided to keep their babies. For the most part though, back in the 1900's-1950's, unwed females were often viewed by the State as unfit mothers. Thus the children became wards of the state and were placed in foster homes, or adopted out to middle-income families that could afford to raise and educate them and the like. You have to understand that it was a much different time period and they frowned on unwed mothers back then. We scarcely raise an eyebrow about single parents nowadays, but back then it was a whole different mind-set.

I could tell that the building had a lot of history behind it by the architecture. I met, and made immediate friends with a woman I'll call Trish. She was a divorcee' with a young son. Her ex wasn't giving her any child-support, so she 'had' to work to make ends meet for her son, and herself. Back in the 70's the state didn't go after men to make support payments like they do now.

Trish and I often worked together on the same floors. We encountered many S.A. Personnel with their navy blue uniforms on. They had captains, sergeants, and corporals. Not unlike the military. They, mostly operated the home out back, but would come to the hospital to assist the nursing staff with the patients, or to work in the nurseries. They had 3 nurseries. One on each floor.

We had utility rooms to store our carts/supplies in on the first floor. There were about 4 utility rooms. One in each wing. We had additional storage for our supplies down in the basement. 

Like I said, Trish and I connected, and got along right away. My first couple weeks there Trish would always insist on our going to the basement together, and not alone. I didn't really question her about that as I thought she was just being concerned about my getting lost down there. That was a definite possibility since it was a maze of hallways with a multitude of rooms on either side of the halls. Not to mention the shipping/receiving docks, boiler rooms, kitchen supply, housekeeping articles, and, yes, the morgue was located down there. We could access the basement via the elevator, or the stairwells.

However, I learned quickly where everything was located. One day I was headed toward the elevator to go down to fetch some supplies when Trish noticed me and asked me where I was going. I told her I was just going to the basement to get some things for the utility room. She told me that she'd come with me. I exclaimed that she needn't bother since I knew my way around down there, but she 'insisted'. About then she piqued my curiosity and I asked her why. She said she'd explain 'after' we got what we needed and came back up.

We got our supplies, and came back to the first floor, at which point I awaited her explanation. She invited me into the lounge because she said we could talk better in there. The lounge was empty. We seated ourselves on a couch by the window. She, then, let out a nervous sigh and told me that her 'reason' was because 'strange' things have happened to her when she went down there alone.

 I must've read her mind because I said ""You're going to tell me there's a ghost down there. Am I right?""

 I was met with a stunned silence for a split second, and then she nodded her head. She told me not to think she was crazy, but something happened to her that frightened her to the point that she won't go there alone. I told her that I did not think she was crazy because I had my fair share of paranormal encounters myself. I asked her to tell me what happened. 

Trish had already been there a couple years when I started. She said that shortly after she started working there, that she went to the basement to get supplies one day. She wasn't thinking of anything except getting what she needed and getting back to the floor to work. She had collected a bag-full of items, and turned around to head back towards the elevator when she 'saw' a young woman with blondish hair staring at her with a startled look on her face. She noticed that she could almost see 'through' the woman. Trish screamed and dropped her bag and ran full-steam ahead to the elevator. When she reached the first floor she grabbed a security guard and pleaded with him to escort her back to the basement. He could see that she was visibly shaken, so he didn't ask any questions. He just went with her downstairs to retrieve her bag of supplies and bring her back up. Trish said the guard must've thought she was either certifiable, or just an hysterical woman. She didn't care, but felt better when he went with her.

By this point Trish was wringing her hands nervously. I told her to calm down. I told her that she shouldn't so much fear the ghost as the living are much more of a problem. I was attempting to inject a little levity into the situation to get her to relax a bit. She wasn't amused. I explained that the woman was once a living, breathing person, and possibly her life was cut unexpectedly short by a medical mishap. After all, this 'is' a hospital and people do die here. Not very pleasant, but a fact. She, then, eased back onto the couch with an understanding grin on her face. She said that she still did not want to go down there alone, but wanted to know if we 'talked' to the ghost if it would help. My reply was that we'll find out the next time we head that way.

Of course, the situation arose when we needed more supplies again. We went 'together'. Trish wouldn't have had it any other way. I introduced ourselves to our unseen hostess and explained that we were not there to harm, or bother her, but we, merely needed some important items so we could do our work.

 We began gathering some supplies when Trish sounded annoyed and announced that all the paper towels had been moved. They were always in a specific spot on a certain shelf, and now she couldn't find them. We conducted a search of every shelf and could not locate the much-needed paper towels. By then I was slightly exasperated. I wanted to know what idiot moved something that we go through so fast, and absolutely needed to find. After that statement, we both heard a muffled, but heavy thud on the floor several feet behind us. Trish let out a small shriek, and I admit that I gasped. However, when we looked behind us, there on the floor was a large banded together carton of paper towels. I uttered a special 'thank you' to our unseen benefactor for her kind assistance. I told her that we never would've seen them way up on the top of the shelves where they were had she not helped us. It may have been my imagination, but I almost thought I 'heard' a soft feminine voice respond saying 'you're welcome'. I'm not sure, but I thought I 'heard' it.

We complained to our supervisor when we got back to the floor. We told him that we would have to be 7 feet tall to see where those paper towels were moved to. We told him that we used a long broom to knock them down to retrieve them because we thought a ladder would be too shaky for either of us. He apologized, and promised to have them placed back where it would be convenient and safe for us to access them.

No way were we going to tell him that a ghost helped us to get them. Not too sure he'd buy 'that'.

"Our Haunted First Apartment","Ohio","Haunted Places","Way back in 1972 I was a newlywed to my first husband; Bill, the bum (Feel the love here). We ran away to Kentucky to get married because you could get married there at 16 years old without parental consent. It was 2 weeks after I turned 18 and I could leave Ohio at 18 as 'that' was, then, considered legal age to do so. A mistake on my part, but I corrected it a few years later. However, that's another story not really appropriate for this site.

We were living with 'his' Foster parents when we came back to Willoughby. My parents were just glad to see I was alive, but they were less than thrilled with Bill. I grew to understand that later on. At any rate, we were living in Esther's house that was a former Boarding house long before I met Bill. One room in the house was haunted by the ghost of a former boarder named Chester who was an alcoholic and, unfortunately passed on there. I encountered poor Chester and mentioned him in a previous post about Esther's boarding house. He was merely confused and not aware of his non-living state until I, gently, explained it to him. Thus, helping him to move on to a better existence.

We lived with Esther and Dave for about a year and a half, but it was hardly subliminal. We had very little privacy except for up in our bedroom, or when we left every weekend for our playing jobs. We were, both, guitarists and in a 4-piece band.

 Our drummer, call her S., was, also, our manager. That way we always 'had' our manager with us. She would find the gigs and negotiate our pay-scales. That was about the only fun I had while married to Bill since he mostly didn't stay employed too long. He had a problem with work called laziness. Those weekend gigs helped keep us in gas and food though for several months until 'I' found employment as a nursing assistant in a nearby hospital. Believe it, or not. Back then $2.25/hour was a fairly decent wage, and we were able to move out to our first apartment at last. Ah, privacy!

The apartment was once a huge century old mansion that the owners converted into 8 separate apartments. 4 upstairs and 4 downstairs. We got the one on the far-left side in the back facing the street. The rent was only $110.00 a month. Can you believe that? The apartment was so tiny that you could, literally, stand in the center of the living room and turn around slowly and see the entire apartment without leaving 'that' spot. It had the living room, bedroom off of the living room, bathroom off of the bedroom and the kitchen. The kitchen was the only large section of the whole place. There was a door in the kitchen that led down to the basement, but we never went down there.

We had to wallpaper the living room since it was an ugly puke yellow color, and we laid some nice, new linoleum down since the floors were bare wood. We didn't want splinters in our feet. I told the landlords that 'we' were doing it to improve the appearance of the place to our liking and didn't expect them to increase the rent as 'we' were doing all the work. They agreed. 

While we were busy improving the place and setting up housekeeping, we didn't really notice anything right away. Once we had the work completed is when we began to notice some annoying and strange developments. 

It started out rather subtle at first. We had an apartment directly above us. The other 3 were located in such a way as to have 2 on one side, and 2 on the other side. 

It started with some noises above us. Usually in the daytime. No big deal. The sound of the other tenants. Or so we thought. Like I said, we didn't give too much credence to it. However, those noises grew louder in intensity, and we heard them day and night. Especially when we were trying to sleep. How rude can you get? We took it for months until it got ridiculous.

When Bill was at work one day, I took the initiative to call the landlord and say something about it. When I told the wife about the rude tenant above us keeping us up all night with their racket, I was greeted with silence at first. She told me that she'd look into it. I let it go at that. I was hoping that the landlords would have a talk with the person living up there and tell them to be more considerate. No such luck.

The racket became much more distinctive at night. It actually sounded like someone rolling something around on wheels. Apparently, the floors in all the apartments were bare wood floors making it easy to hear someone walking around, or moving furniture, and the like. We, also, heard what sounded like they were hammering nails into the plaster walls. That noise was sporadic, but most annoying when you're in bed.

We knew there were other tenants upstairs. An old man that lived by himself and an older couple. We didn't know who was in the other 2 apartments. We really didn't neighbor too much.

We got pretty fed up with the noisy neighbor above us and decided to go up to the apartment and talk to them ourselves. It appeared that the landlords didn't follow through with their idle promise. Driven by annoyance, and sick of being kept up nights we marched upstairs to confront our tormentor. We resolutely stood outside of the apartment door and persistently began knocking on it. We got no answer. We kept pounding until we'd get a response. About then the woman that lived with her husband directly across from that apartment opened her door. She looked to be in her 40's, attractive, and spoke nicely to us inquiring as to what we were doing.

 We explained that whoever was living in there was keeping us up practically all night with all the racket they were making. I asked ""why don't they open the door? Are they deaf so they can't hear all the noise they're making at all hours? What's their problem? We're getting quite aggravated about it. The landlord assured us that they'd talk to them, but nothing's been done so far."" 

She had a rather blank look on her face. She introduced herself and invited us in so she could 'talk' to us. Her husband was at work, but she asked us to sit down. She offered us some coffee. We were seated at her dining room table as she brought the coffee out to us. She had a cup with us. She told us not to think she was crazy, but her husband, and her have been hearing the same noises since they moved in the year before us. She said hearing what we said made her realize that what her husband and her surmised convinced her that 'they' weren't just bonkers and hearing things. She said that that particular apartment was 'empty'.

 Our jaws dropped. Even Bill, the sceptic, was stunned. We told her somebody 'has' to be in there. She confirmed that the 'only' people they've seen in there were the landlord and his wife when they come by once a week in the mornings to clean it. She said that they've seen the landlords 'showing' the apartment to several people, yet no one comes back, or has moved into it. She took a deep sip of her coffee and told us with a very serious tone in her voice that her husband, and her believed 'that' place was haunted.

I believe my reaction was ""say whaaaaaaaaaaaat?"" She wasn't joking in the least little bit. She said that her husband, and she were looking for another place to move to because it was beginning to scare them.

 I asked her if she knew 'anything' as to 'why' it might be haunted?

All she could tell me was that the old man that lived down the hall next door might know something since he had been living there for a number of years. She didn't want to question him since they didn't know him personally and weren't sure how to inquire about it.

Fortunately, I was a little braver, and the curiosity was more than I could stand.

 I waited for my day off from the hospital. I did notice an old fellow that would periodically sit out on the front porch when the weather permitted it. The house had a wraparound porch, so I just walked around to the front when I saw him outside one day. I introduced myself and told him that we recently moved in around the back. I started some polite conversation trying not to be too obvious about my curiosity. I asked him how well he was acquainted with his neighbors, and did he like living there? Things like that. 

During the conversation he mentioned that there 'was' a strange old guy that lived in the apartment opposite him at the end of the hallway. He said the man had to get around with a wheeled walker because he had difficulty walking.

He thought the guy was a little kooky since he was frequently thinking he had to pound nails into the walls to hang things. He wasn't satisfied with his surroundings and was constantly trying to change it. He told me that the guy was rather anti-social and complained all the time. He said that he was living there for about 4 years when the landlord showed up to collect the rent one day only to find him lying on the bedroom floor. Apparently, he'd had a heart-attack. That was that.

It began to make sense. This man quite obviously was not aware that he was, no longer, on the physical plane, and was carrying on with his obsessive habits that he had in life. I imparted my revelation to Bill, and even he couldn't argue with me about it.

 We stayed less than a year and moved to a much nicer apartment elsewhere. It wasn't much of a beginning for a newlywed couple in their very first place to find out that it has haunted. Our relationship didn't improve too much after leaving, but I couldn't blame a ghost for that. Bill turned out to be lazy and a run-around. The marriage ended, and I met a wonderful man that I had my fair share of adventures with. However, John and I had some very enlightening, and fascinating stories to share with each other. I am, now, sharing my accounts here. Thank you for reading them!"
"A Life Saved By My Mother - 3 Years After Passing","Alabama","Family / Friends Visits","I just recently came across this website and I love it. I've always believed in the paranormal (I think it's because my mother was so fascinated by paranormal and true crime). I wouldn't call myself a psychic, but I have had dreams that have come true and 'gut feelings' that were correct.

This is a story about my mother (and my father). My mother passed away unexpectedly in 2006 and it was such a devastating experience for our entire family, especially for my father. The day my mother passed away, was the day my father lost the beautiful sparking in his sapphire blue eyes.

My father always enjoyed piddling around outside (vegetable gardens, green houses, working on his antique hot-rod car etc). One weekend my husband (now ex husband) and I moved and during that move I had managed to catch the flu.

 On our first day and night in our new home my father came over around 6pm-7pm and I was in bed sleeping. My husband woke me up and said 'Your dad is here and he wants to see you."" He knew I had the flu, but it was very unusual for my father to just show up out of the blue, especially when it was dark outside (he did not see well enough to drive at night). I got out of bed and went into the living room to see my father to make sure he was okay. Back then (2009) when we all had interchangeable phones, I had several of them. I'd buy a new phone and the old one would be placed in our 'cell phone collection'. My father told me he had been out working in the yard and had his telephone in his front pocket of his shirt and he bent over to pick some weeds out of the ground and his cell phone had fallen into a bucket of water. I asked him if he had taken the SIM card out and soaked both the SIM card and the phone itself in rice. He said he did but it was too soon for the phone to dry, or it may never dry making it useless. He asked me if I could get one of my phones and put his SIM card in it so he would have a phone (he had the landline disconnected shortly after my mother died). I was feeling so ill with the flu and since we had just moved and I no idea where our 'cell phone collection box' was, I told him that he would be fine for one night without a phone and I would get him another phone first thing in the morning. He agreed saying 'I can go one night without a phone."" I gave him an air hug (since I was contagious), told him I loved him and I went back to bed and he went home.

About 6 hours later (it was about 1am), I was woken by my mother's voice. I was not dreaming so I didn't see her, but I heard her voice and she said 'Get your father a phone'. I felt it may have been a dream, it may have been that I had a high fever but I disregarded hearing her voice thinking I was just too out of it from cold and flu medications and sleeping aids. About 2 minutes later, I heard my mother again say 'Get your father a phone!"" This time her tone was not very sweet - it was louder and more demanding. I sat up in bed so fast that it woke my husband up. I got out of bed looking for the box of cell phones. My husband asked me why was I looking for a phone when I told my father that I would get him a new cell phone the following morning. I didn't tell my husband that my mother demanded I get my father a phone, that she was basically yelling at me from beyond the grave (he would have thought I was crazy). I found 3 phones that I knew would work with my father's SIM card. I got in my car and my husband insisted on going with me (I don't know why really). I unlocked my father's front door. He was sound asleep in the recliner in his living room. He woke when he heard his front door open and hearing me say ""Hey Dad"". He was curious as to why I was over there so late and why was I bringing a phone to him when I said I was getting him a phone the following morning. I didn't tell my father about my mother either. I just told him I didn't feel comfortable knowing he did not have a phone especially if there was an emergency. 

Anyway, I got one of the phones working with his SIM card and plugged it in to the charger. Around 3:30am, my father called me and said ""Julie, I'm not feeling so well. I woke up vomiting and I have a little pain in my lower abdomen. When my father says he is having a 'little pain' - that means he's actually having extreme pain (he had a high tolerance for pain). I got him to the hospital within 30 minutes and within 2 hours of being at the ER, they admitted him. His intestines had twisted and what he was throwing up was bile. He was just a few hours away from becoming septic. 

My mother, from the grave, saved my father's life that night. I finally did tell him about mom demanding that I get a phone to him immediately. When I told him, he cried (and he was not a man that cried much).

Just wanted to share this with all who reads it...it's not a haunting or anything scary and I don't think I would classify this a paranormal, but it was my mother coming to me in order to save my father's life."
"Larry, Looking For Trouble And Finding It","Ohio","Haunted Places","Here is another account that happened to my late husband, John, when he was between 16-18 years old. He had this friend named Larry. He thought Larry was a bit of a lamebrain, but they shared an interest in working on cars back when you 'could' work on a car before they became so computerized. They and a couple other guys would do what most boys did. They liked to ditty-bop around in their cars together and get into a little mischief from time to time. Nothing serious. Just being adventurous.

One day Larry got the notion to check out a graveyard in Willoughby, Ohio where John was living at the time. He had heard some stories about it being haunted. John knew the one he was talking about, but he told Larry that it was a stupid idea. However, the other two guys that Larry mentioned it to were game for it.

John rode along grudgingly just to see if they'd really follow through with it. They arrived sometime after midnight. The story was that there was a girl in blue that was killed by a train a long time ago. No one knew if it was an accident, or a suicide, but she was wearing a blue dress when they found her body. She had no identification in her purse or in her suitcase. The girl simply left a boarding house she was staying in and boarded a bus. Only to be found much later by the railroad tracks. It was the biggest mystery in Willoughby at that time period. I remember hearing about it many times myself. Since no one knew 'who' she was the townsfolk took pity on her and got her a headstone engraved with 'The girl in blue' and the date that she died. They weren't too sure about a birth date, other than she appeared to be in her early twenties. No one knew from where she came, or where she was headed. It was a rather sad story. I had seen the grave myself, but in the daytime and with the utmost respect.

The story was that she must have been in town to meet a paramour, but possibly was jilted by him. Being heartbroken she, then, jumped in front of an oncoming train out of despair. Thus, she was not at rest. It was said that she would wander around the grounds looking for the man that she thought loved her, but never finding him. The girl in blue became something of a legend in Willoughby. To some degree, she still is.

Well, the guys got there and Larry and the other two wanted to see if the legend was true. John would not enter the graveyard at all. He stayed by the car. He told them they were a bunch of jerks wandering into a cemetery at night. He told them that he, personally, did not believe in disturbing the peace of a cemetery and that he had too much respect for them. The guys berated him a bit, but John stood his ground and refused to join them. John and I believed in the same principles. We were, both, Christians and believed in the supernatural since we both had encounters early on. We learned what you should and should 'not' do and areas that you shouldn't venture into to begin with. I guess you could say that we accumulated some wisdom from our past experiences, eh!

However, the 'three stooges'-as John later called them-just 'had' to prove how tough and brave they were and proceeded to enter the cemetery through the wrought iron gates while John waited by the car smoking a cigarette. John said they were gone long enough for him to smoke a few cigarettes. He said he could hear them talking in the distance but couldn't make out the conversation. He could hear them chuckling and getting a bit loud, but he wasn't the least bit curious as to what they were doing. He just remained steadfastly by the car.

He said they must've been gone about twenty minutes, or so, when he heard Larry calling out to him. John answered back to him asking what he wanted. After that, John said he heard all of them screech and saw them running back towards the gate where he was waiting. Once they got through the gate, Larry was heaving and winded, but kept yelling ""Get in the car, just get in the car. Now, man."" They all piled into the car muttering expletives and screaming to just ""take off"". Larry was so rattled that he, accidentally, backed into a small sapling before regaining his wits and putting the car in drive.

Once they were finally on the way out of there did, they quieted down enough to tell John what happened to them. Up to that point John didn't utter a word. He could tell they were freaked out of their wits. According to Larry, they were joking around and daring someone to come forward or do something. They never expected 'something' to happen, but it did. While they were standing near the girl in blue's headstone, they thought they heard someone walking in the leaves not far from them. When they looked off to the side about 20 feet, or so in the distance they saw a figure coming towards them. That was when Larry called out to John thinking it was him. However, when John answered back from 'outside' the gates they 'knew' that something was wrong. They just stood there, fixated, on the figure coming towards them. They could tell it was a man, but what actually sent them screaming was the fact that they didn't see 'any' legs as he was coming towards them. They could hear the crunching of the leaves as he was moving, but there were no legs and feet to make the sounds. They 'all' saw it. From there they just bolted out of the gates and didn't look back. John admitted that he had a sense of ""I told you so"" satisfaction because he tried to tell them not to pursue the idea. That was part of the reason that John referred to Larry as a lamebrain. I agree. I met Larry a few months after John, and I got together. There's nothing wrong with him. He's just a natural born jerk.

 However, when I asked him about the Cemetery adventure, he absolutely 'refused' to talk about it. It left him that shook up.

In regard to the 'girl in blue', she was finally identified in 2000 something. The local paper, the News Herald ran a special story on her. Someone took the initiative to send that story to other states in the hope of ending the mystery of solving her identity. They drew an artist's conception of her based on the old autopsy report and eyewitness accounts as to what she looked like. 

She was an unknown from 1940 something when she perished, and the mystery began. However, she 'was' finally identified after all those years by one of her brothers in another state who was elderly by that time. Most of her immediate family was very sparce, but at last she was identified. He came out to Willoughby and thanked the paper for printing that story and releasing it elsewhere because when he read it and saw her picture, he said it closed a hole in his and other family members' hearts. The mysterious girl in blue had a 'name' at last. They erected a new stone with her 'name' inscribed on it. I'm not mentioning her name out of respect for the family that waited so very long to find out what happened to her so long ago. It's nice that she has family to recognize her and be aware of her. I wonder if Larry read that story!"
"The Slumber Party Incident","Ohio","Ouija Board / Seances","This happened a long time ago in my teen years. You know. The years when you're daring and reckless! However, I was the one who 'knew' better during this particular incident.

My two best friends-call them Dee and Val-wanted to have a slumber party. We had a previous one at Dee's house and had a lot of fun. This time it was to be at Val's house. We invited some of our other friends. Eight of us in total. We arrived at Val's house around six in the evening. Her mother ordered some pizzas and pop for all of us. We really enjoyed that. From there we went down to the basement where Val's parents fixed up the rec-room to accommodate all of us with mats and sleeping bags. While down there one of the girls told us about a trick of sorts that we could experiment with. One of you lies on the floor and the others gather around with one person at the head and feet. The person at the head leads it off with this is so and so. She is dead and everyone around them says the same thing. Then the lead person says she is light as a feather and stiff as a board and around to each person again. The last thing the lead says is she will rise and float like a feather. At that point we all have two fingers of both our hands under the person and we begin to lift in unison. Guess what? It 'worked'. 

Val was the one on a sleeping bag that we lifted. The floor was too dirty, so she laid on a sleeping bag. She actually 'did' float beyond our grasp and rise to the ceiling until her nose touched it. We were freaking and she opened her eyes and screamed. We all panicked and withdrew our hands shouting, ""catch her, catch her."" However, nobody was holding her, and she fell from ceiling height. Wham! Fortunately, she landed on the sleeping bag with no injuries other than just being shook up.

We were very intrigued by this. Actually, we were mystified. About then Val and Dee-they are the main protagonists here-got the bright idea to have a Ouija board session. Val asked the girl that lived right next door to her to go home and fetch her board. Apparently, this girl had one. About this time, I gave them all a great, big ""Nope. Not me."" I told my friend, Dee about the session my sister and cousins had a couple years before and she was extremely intrigued by my account of what happened. I told her that I think they are dangerous and not a toy to be played with. They called me chicken. I told them ""That's right, I'm a chicken that knows 'better'"". I'm going home, but I 'am' warning you that you'll regret messing with that thing, and I bid them a good night. I gave my mom a lame duck excuse for coming home from the party. I told her that the pizza gave me an upset stomach. Unfortunately, I had to endure a spoonful of Pepto-Bismal. Yuck! I went to bed.

The next day there was a knock on our side door. It was Dee looking very ashen and wide-eyed. She asked me to step outside so we could talk.

While outside she looked at me serious as a heart attack and told me what happened after I left. She apologized for calling me 'chicken' and told me that ""I"" was absolutely 'right' about warning them not to mess with that thing. They were asking it stupid questions like who was going to marry whom and that kind of girl stuff, but then they asked questions they shouldn't have. They began receiving knocks in response to their questions. Right away Val thought it was her older brother, but he was in the living room with the rest of the family watching T.V. When she went upstairs to query him. They continued, even more intrigued than ever. However, they started getting unnerving answers and hearing strange noises. I am only going by what Dee told me. They got scared and quit the session. 

They all climbed into their sacks/mats. That is when things started that 'they' couldn't explain. Dee told me that it got incredibly cold down there and they heard more knocking. They, then, began to hear something shuffling around them in a steady gait, but they didn't 'see' anything. A couple of the girls yelped after being poked by unseen fingers. They were so scared that they began making a commotion that alarmed her mother to the point of running down to the basement to find out what was going on. When they told her mom what they did, she really read Val and the others the riot act. She told them that those things are not toys and she confirmed that they are dangerous if you don't know what you're doing. She told the girl that brought it to get it out of her house or she'd take a sledgehammer to it. The girl ran home and disposed of it. She was truly frightened. They didn't get much sleep that night.

Dee told me that Val would be coming by, also, to apologize to me because I was right to caution them. Matter of fact, they 'all' apologized to me. Quite humbly I might add. I didn't hold it against them. It's a shame that they had to get so terrified to realize ""I"" was merely giving them good advice. I told them I was 'trying' to give 'them' the benefit of my experience and how it scared the crap out of me, my sister and cousins also. They listened to me a wee bit more after that. I became the knowledgeable sage to them where the paranormal was concerned. However, I am 'still' learning things to this day. I think we 'all' are. I never was tacky enough to say ""I told you so"" because I figured that they felt bad enough. Not to mention scared enough. Sometimes teenage girls can be as bad as teenage boys when it comes to doing things without considering the consequences. This occurrence could have been a lot worse, but I'm very glad that it wasn't for my friends' sake. All comments are welcome!"
"Dog Doesn't Believe That There's Nothing There","Virginia","Haunted Places","We moved into a historic home in Diamond Hill neighborhood of Lynchburg, VA in 2019

With us were our 2 dogs, one large bouvier with arthritis and the other an active, but older hound dog. 

The bouvier couldn't make up the stairs, so he slept downstairs whereas the hound dog followed us up every night to the second floor. Our bedroom was on the western side of the house with several rooms in between the eastern side of the house and a small room that we used as a study. The hound dog, Trooper, would go into every room and location upstairs, about 4 rooms, except the study and the stairs to the attic. 

The study was a very small room (6'x10') that is very well lit with 2 large windows, and furniture from our other house (book case, desk, table with tea set and a couple of chairs) and a soft carpet... In other words very nonthreatening. Trooper would not go into the room, no matter how much urging. If I nudged him forward he would whimpered. Sometimes at night I would find him in the middle of the hallway just staring at the open doorway of the room. 

Reference the stairs to the attic. The were very wide (5') and well lit by both lights and windows. Trooper would go up a couple of steps, then turn immediately around. 

I never knew what Trooper saw... I never heard or saw anything but he was definitely concerned or afraid of those areas of the house. Our 2 cats go into the study all the time and since Trooper passed away we have gotten a new puppy and he doesn't seem concerned about the study, but now that I think about it, I've never seen him go in there either."
"The Old Parma Train Station Secretary","Ohio","Haunted Places","This event didn't happen to me, but to my late husband, John, back when he was 15 years old, and I have no reason to doubt the validity of his account. He and I have, both, had paranormal encounters throughout our lives. He was quite psychic himself, having gotten that ability from his mother's side of the family.

Back in 1961 about several months after the Parma rail station closed permanently, he and his buddy, Eddy, decided to go exploring the abandoned 2-story building to see what they could find of interest. Back then it wasn't called urban exploration. It was called trespassing plain and simple. They were old enough to know better, but too young to resist. I'm not being critical of them since I've trespassed once, or twice in my youth myself. The last time I trespassed was with my cousins and sister in Pennsylvania. We were greeted by a farmer with a shotgun. Lesson learned. I, no longer, trespassed after 'that' incident.

First, a little background on the original railroad station. It was opened in 1909 as part of the B&O Railroad. The site was located in Parma, Ohio. It was a passenger train at first. In 1913 it was enlarged by adding a 2nd story to the building. In 1926 it went from transporting passengers to hauling coal and freight. It operated in that capacity until it completely shut down in 1961. The building was completely demolished in 1962 thus preventing curious teens and whomever from invading the premises for a thrill. Let alone possible injuries, or fatalities since it was run down and not safe to walk around in.

Before that happened, John and his friend, Eddy, decided it would be 'neat' to go explore the place to see what interesting treasures they could find. They waited for a weekend. It was nearing nightfall. They mounted their bikes since it wasn't too far to get to. It took less than a half an hour to get there by bike. It was a bit darker when they arrived, but they each had a flashlight with them.

They dropped their bikes near the perimeter and ventured on to the vacant building. The office door was locked. However, what appeared to be a large garage door was partially open for them to gain access. From there they entered what looked like a warehouse that had 4 doors to the right of it. Those doors led to different office areas. With a long hallway between them. They entered the main dispatch office. Inside it was very dark as there were, certainly, no streetlights around outside. They shined their flashlights around to peruse the area. They saw a number of old metal desks lined up along the wall with all sorts of antiquated office machines sitting on them. They noticed a huge, old map covering an area of wall on the far end of the room. It smelled extremely musty and dirty naturally. 

Because it was rather dark with no ambient streetlight, they moved cautiously through the office inspecting the desks and opening the drawers that were now just empty, except for some old, tattered file folders that smelled moldy. They were rather engrossed in trying to see what they could possibly find that might be useful to take back home, when they both heard a steady click, click, click, click noise fairly nearby. They were puzzled as to the source of that noise since they knew the building was empty. They began shining their lights around trying to locate the source. Suddenly, Eddy nervously remarked to John that he found it and to come look at what he was seeing quickly.

 John hurriedly left the area he was checking out to join Eddy in front of a large desk located in the middle of the office. On the desk was a very old type of adding machine. The kind with a lot of keys and an arm on the side of it that had to be pulled down to advance to the next row. I 'think' it was called a comptometer, but don't quote me on that. They stood in relative shock and amazement when they noticed that the keys on the device were being punched in making the clicking noise 'by themselves' with no human agent nearby to 'operate' it.

They snapped out of it rather abruptly when Eddy winced and told John that they should get the 'bleep' out of there. He began pushing John toward the entry door that they came in and out into the warehouse, then outside running toward their bikes. John said he didn't know Eddy could run 'that' fast since he was on the somewhat portly side.

Once they reached the bikes, they paused to catch their breath. Eddy was almost hyperventilating by that point but was beginning to calm down enough to talk. John noticed how rattled and pale Eddy was. He asked him what happened to alarm him like that. Eddy rather sheepishly told John that he 'heard' a woman's stern voice close to his ear telling him to stop poking around and leave. John told him that 'he' didn't see 'anybody' in there but the 2 of them.

 However, when they both glanced back at the building where the windows to the offices were located, they 'saw' the face and partial silhouette of an older woman. She looked to be dressed like they did in the 1940's with gun-metal grey hair in a short, curled hairstyle and a clipboard clutched to her chest. It was the look on her face that sent the chills down them. She did have a very stern demeanor to her facial expression. 

They didn't stick around to rationalize or discuss it. They just hopped on their bikes and peddled like the wind back home. They had had enough adventure for one night.

The next day John went to Eddy's house and his friend felt a bit more comfortable about talking about the previous night. Eddy told John that he used to be a sceptic in regard to things like ghosts, but he couldn't explain what he heard and what they 'both' observed the other night inside the building, as well as the strange woman standing at the window glaring out at them. John told him that the building was very old and had seen a lot of use and activity in its day. He surmised that, possibly, the phantom woman was a former secretary that used to work there. It was quite possible that being a secretary was very important to her and after she passed, she came back to the place where she felt useful and happy. John said, ""I think we disturbed her space and she let us know about it.""

 ""To the point of chasing us out"". Eddy had to nod in agreement. It made sense at that point. 

They kept the incident between themselves and never went back to the place. When it was demolished the following year, they both wondered if the lonely secretary finally moved on, no longer having her office desk to work at. It was a little piece of Ohio rail history that they wanted to investigate but it didn't quite turn out the way they thought it would. John told me he didn't go exploring old buildings after that. No more trespassing for him either. John and I were part of the population that 'had' to learn the 'hard way'. Hopefully, these accounts serve to enlighten our younger readers that you should be very careful 'what' you decide to venture into. Enough said!"
"Too Cold For Comfort","North Carolina","Haunted Places","Recently I placed a trail camera in my backyard to capture the deer feeding at night as well as to see what other animals may be around. Usually I turn it off during the day but being in a rush that morning I had left it on. The camera was focused from one corner of the yard so it cover the entire area including my wife's building which stores her collection of antiques.

 I came home that afternoon and found her wrapped in blankets on the couch and she said she had been working in the building when all of a sudden she got ice cold and could not get warm again; this was a warm day which made it odd. She said she wasn't sick it just came from nowhere. I left her to recover and retrieve the camera SD card to view and found that during the night several deer had been in the yard. Now the strange thing was that two of the deer were standing beside each other looking as if posing but when I went back to that frame it wasn't there, the only one of them had them looking the other way. The posing picture was completely gone and I can't explain how that happened. 

It was further into the day and around the time my wife said she was working in her building I came across a clip that had caught a white mass above the front area of her building. I have used that camera many times since and have yet to capture anything like it again. In the past we have had incidents from bringing home items that did have attachments. Once was a older ladies compact that she must had been truly fond of, but that's another story."
"The Gettysburg Soldier","Pennsylvania","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","This incident occurred way back when I was 12 years old in the 8th grade in Junior High School (That's what it was called back then in the 60's.) when our history teacher, Mrs. K., arranged a field trip to historic Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, for the entire class. Our parents filled out the necessary paperwork, and we readied ourselves for this momentous field trip.

Mrs. K was a very knowledgeable, and, to some degree, tough teacher. We all swore that 'she' knew George Washington, and Abe Lincoln 'personally'. Seriously. I used to complain about her to my mom, but my mom said that if she was tough, it was because she 'really' was a thorough, and efficient educator. She was right. To this day I actually do remember what Mrs. K drilled into our heads. Believe me, you 'learned' in 'her' class, and I'm grateful for that in retrospect.

On to the trip. We were loaded onto 2 Greyhound buses. The boys on one bus, and us girls in the other. The buses were carrying a full load of pre-teenagers from Willoughby, Ohio to Pennsylvania. Eek! God love them for enduring us for the entirety of that trip. Before arriving in Gettysburg, we went through Hershey, PA., where the chocolate factory is located. We toured the factory where the work force was mostly Amish employees, and we all got free little bags of candy bars. Very cool. From there we went to have dinner in a nice restaurant. After dinner, it was getting toward dusk. We spent the night in a Best Western Hotel and had to get up early the next morning to continue on to Gettysburg.

Once we arrived in Gettysburg, they took us to another facility that was a bunch of neat, little cabins lined up in a row on both sides of the property. They arranged for us to bunk 4 to a cabin. The cabins all had a couple double beds in them. The boys on one side of the road, and the girls opposite them. We went to the main building there as it had a large cafeteria and proceeded to have lunch. During our lunch the 3 teachers that accompanied us on the trip were handing out some fliers for us to peruse about the museums, battlegrounds, homes, pertinent facts, etc...

Sometime early afternoon we embarked on our tour of the fields/battlegrounds. 

There were many statues commemorating the famous officers/Generals that were involved in the strategies, and the battles. They had reenactors that were dressed up as Union, and Confederate soldiers. We were escorted by one man, dressed as a union soldier who had a real musket that he loaded and fired off for us. It was very loud. I swear every bird in every tree flew into the air after he fired it. It was fascinating.

Afterwards, they enacted a battle for us. Live theater. It was great.

After the entertainment we were allowed to wander the grounds upon which those battles were fought. You could just 'feel' the history as you were walking the fields. I was with about 10 other girls as we were meandering across the fields. We stopped, briefly, next to a group of rocks behind which were 3 artillery cannons. The cannon balls were in little stacked piles next to guns. From that focal point we could look off into the distance to see the rest of the fields. It was vast.

Unexpectedly off in the distance, but close enough to notice, there came a young man out of the wooded area surrounding the fields. He looked to be about 15, maybe 16. Too young to even be shaving. I thought he was rather cute. As most young pre-teen girls are about boys.

He was wearing a blue union uniform that seemed to be rather worn and dirty. He was shouldering a musket gun that, almost looked as tall as he did. He had brownish hair, white gloves, a big belt around his waist with a canteen, and other accoutrements that a soldier would require.

Naturally, I assumed he was another reenactor. He raised his hand when he noticed me looking at him, smiled and waved to me. I, instinctively, waved back at him. It was the polite thing to do anyway. One of the other girls I was with asked me 'who' I was waving at. I, suddenly, realized that 'she' didn't see the young man that 'I' saw. I told her that I was waving away the gnats that were swarming around. The gnats were swarming around about that time so she believed me.

I felt a little chill go up my spine, but then began to rationalize that since I had soldiers on my mind, that I was simply 'seeing' things.

I said nothing to the other girls.

 We were ushered back to our cabins once it began to get dark and got ready for bed. The other 3 girls I was sharing accommodations with were somewhat silent. Finally, one girl came to me and said she just 'had' to confide in me. She said that she noticed me in the school library reading books on ghosts and the paranormal thereby assuming that 'I' believed in that stuff. I confirmed that I did. She and the other 2 girls confessed to me that 'they' saw the young soldier also. They noticed me wave, and were about to do the same when the one girl asked me 'who' I was waving at. They, too, figured out that not everyone there 'saw' him. I felt a bit spooked at this point, but gratified that 'others' did see what I saw.

We, then, had a lengthy discussion about the whole thing. We 'saw' him and we each described the same young man to a tee. We were trying to reason 'why' only 'we' saw him. Couldn't answer that one, but we theorized that, just maybe, that very young soldier just wanted 'our' friendly recognition and to let us know 'he' was there and did his duty. We got a little closer on that trip and we never forgot it. It is rather humbling to think that so many young boys fought and died on those grounds never getting the chance to realize manhood because of it.

I went back to Gettysburg twice more later on. Once with my parents and sister. The last time with my 1st husband. I never saw the soldier again. Possibly because I was still a kid I was more open to seeing him. I could still feel the presences on the fields though.

Gettysburg is a truly amazing, historic and humbling place to go to. If you get the chance please experience it for yourself!"
"The Speakeasy Ghost","Colorado","Haunted Places","There was an old store in Pueblo, CO that had some paranormal activity. My girlfriend's mother had a religious store and leased the building next door for storage. They were small storefronts so she needed them both to make it work. My girlfriend and I needed an emergency place to live so her mom let us move in the storage side since it had a one bedroom apartment in the back. It had been neglected for a while and very cluttered. We didn't mind straightening it up for a place to live. Most of the inventory fit up front and after getting rid of junk, we had a nice little apartment.

 Living there wasn't bad. It was awkward living in a business district and having an occasional homeless person sleeping in the alley, but we dealt with it. What was strange was once in a while you could feel something, like a force or wind that would just brush past you. We figured it was a ghost but we didn't feel frightened. The whole front of the store was filled with religious items, so you'd think that would protect the place. 

 An interesting phenomena to the store was customers would go to the store looking for protection items at the same time. So I came up with a hypothesis that maybe ghosts travel the sewer lines. To test the idea we exorcised the toilet. This coincided with the front bathroom toilet getting clogged for no apparent reason. So we did an exorcism on it. What's crazy is that it seemed to work. It did clog a couple times afterward, so we repeated the exorcism, and the toilet would flush. I still wonder if that was coincidence.

 This store had the main area up front with a little bathroom, next an office area that led to a living room. There was a kitchen to the right and straight ahead was a bedroom with a bathroom. One day we were coming in from being out and about. I was walking into the living room when I saw a woman peak out from the bathroom (as if she was looking to see who was there) and then she disappeared. It looked like she was about to take a bath. She had red hair and had to have been naked the way she peaked around the door. We immediately checked and there was no one in the bathroom. The experience was surreal and it's hard to describe how I saw the woman. It felt like I had seen half with my eyes and half with my mind. 

 Some nights were restless for us. We'd wake up feeling the urge to go somewhere, so we'd take long walks around the neighborhood. Our walks usually took us around this little vacant medical building on a huge lot. We found out latter that was the site of the old St. Mary's hospital. What is strange is businesses never last in that building. The place is usually empty or being repaired to this day. I don't know why we ended up there, but it was fun and romantic. 

 We moved when the pipes burst in the winter. My girlfriend's mother was transitioning into opening a restaurant so it was time for us to move on.

 Years later, we're married with a son, living about a mile away. There was a liquor store across the alley from the old store that had been there forever. One day my wife had the urge to stop by the liquor store and pick something up. I waited while she ran inside. She talked to a long time worker about the owner who was an elderly lady. The worker told her the lady had past away and her daughter was ready to retire. The worker asked how my wife's mother was doing and why they closed their store. She told him how her mom started a restaurant and how she had always felt weird in that building. He asked her if she knew that the owner used to own that building. Apparently, the building used to be the liquor store before it moved to its current location. Going back further it had a speakeasy in the back where a red headed woman had died. It made sense. Behind the building there was a section that was boarded up. It had two stories and looked like there were a couple rooms. Who knows what happened in that alley. Maybe it had a brothel too?

 My wife was excited to tell me what she learned. She had worked at her mother's store for seven years and finally had a reason for her eeriness toward that place. As for me, I can't believe it wasn't something that I just imagined."
"The Haunting On Midway","Colorado","Haunted Places","In January 2001 I rented a studio apartment in an old Victorian style house in Pueblo, CO. When you entered the front door there were 2 one bedroom apartments on the main floor, and a winding staircase that went to 2 studios upstairs. It was cool because I became friends with the couple that lived downstairs. The husband did repairs to the apartment across from him for money off his rent, so it was vacant. The tenant across from me was an old Hispanic man that had lived there for 20 years. He was friendly but he didn't speak that much English. Overall, this was an ideal location since it was close to my college and easy to get to the bike trail on the Arkansas River.

 Everything was pretty sweet for me upstairs. If you looked out he window you could see the murals on the river levee, one of which was a yin yang with an angel on one side and a demon on the other. At this time I was taking tai chi classes so this couldn't have been better. The one thing I'd do was a little spin as I was walking up the stairs to my apartment. It felt like energy was flowing down the stairs, (or some kind of resistance) so spinning seemed to make it easier going up. 

 Looking back there were a few strange things that happened while living up stairs. This one afternoon I was bored so I drank a couple shots of Everclear I had bought to make some herbal tinctures. Those shots knocked me out and apparently I was out all night partying at a bar on Union. My old roommate's girlfriend was there and told everyone about it. I do remember a little bit and it was embarrassing. She didn't say who took me home but I woke up in my apartment. A few weeks later there was a loud knock on my door. When I answered the door there was a man that was drunk out of his mind thinking this was his apartment. So, I helped him on his way thinking about what I had recently gone through. 

 There was another odd situation. I stopped to talk to the tenant upstairs who was standing by the vacant apartment. The door was open because the other tenant had been working in there. Besides your basic greetings, the old man pointed into the apartment and asked if I could ""see the smoke"". I didn't get what he was saying and didn't see smoke. It was important to him so I agreed with what he was saying, but it didn't make sense.

 A few months after moving in I found a girlfriend and she moved in with me a month later. Thinking that I needed more room, I asked the landlord to move into that vacant apartment below mine. The landlord had no problem with me moving in and paying more rent. So we spent a day moving in, which was easy. 

 Everything was normal until evening. We started feeling uneasy with each other. She felt like I was going to hurt her while I was thinking she was going to hurt me. We were literally sitting on opposite ends of the couch sizing each other up. While that was going on roaches started crawling in under the front door. I'm talking about a massive amount of roaches. They started climbing the walls and some dropped off the ceiling onto us. We saw a few dead ones earlier while cleaning, but there were no roaches upstairs. How could it be this bad? We were freaked out and started saying prayers and burning incense. It seemed to help for around 20 minutes, then it would feel weird again. We kept going in and out to the side porch where we talked about how we were feeling about each other. 

 There was a strange mold I noticed on the front window molding. It was like the size of a pack of cigarettes only not as thick. My girlfriend didn't notice it and she was doing a lot of the cleaning. There was also a crazy face in the wood grain of the front door that didn't help the situation. 

 We decided we should just go to bed and get the day over with. It was hard at first because you could hear the upstairs tenant making noise. He might have been unclogging a drain with a hanger. All we heard were weird sounds in the pipes. After finally falling asleep, I woke to my girlfriend freaking out screaming. When I first looked at her she looked like a different woman. She told me she couldn't see and there was a feeling of pressure on top of her. That was it! We got out of there at like 3-4 AM.

 Later that day, we went to pick up our belongings. I asked my teacher come to see what she thought about the place. She agreed something didn't feel right. Even my girlfriend's mother didn't like it and let us move in the empty side of a shop she had. The last thing that freaked us out was when we were moving out. There was a nest and an egg had fallen and cracked on the porch with the baby bird exposed. We didn't notice it all night with us going in and out the side door.

 I broke my lease and told the landlord he needed an exorcist. A few years later the whole building burned down and they now have a community garden in its place."
"Philbert The Pizza Ghost","Alabama","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","So, this started a few years ago at my old job at a pizza place. I don't have great memory so this won't be a fluent story, more like disorganized highlights. 

It started not long after we began working there. Stuff thrown, things missing, but I didn't think much about until I noticed the footprints. Bare footprints through the left side of the kitchen, coming from the fryer through the storage area and to the drive through window. Now, I'm a logical person and we had a person with schizophrenia working with us so I debated the possibility of it being him with my boyfriend, whom I worked with. We even went as far as try to compare feet to the footprints; none of us matched. It was about 10 1/2 in size and we noticed that over time they would slowly disappear. I don't know why but while I was working there, I had the feeling that his name was Philbert. I don't think I'm psychic, but I could be sensitive to the paranormal as anytime I thought of the ghost, I thought Philbert. A few other happenings were glass fogging in the drive through at odd times, a window was broken after closing one night, from the inside. I personally found it fascinating, but it scared my boyfriend because ""I don't believe in ghosts!"" Well he does now.

Anyway, after a while I started talking to it, asking it questions or asking it to do things. Like this one time we all were goofing around and T asked about the ghost. 

I said ""Philbert, if you're here move this sign."" I pointed to it, it was a map of the surrounding delivery area. We watched it for about 20 seconds and as we were about to give up, it started to move. Not a small amount either. My boyfriend told me there is an air vent next to it so that didn't prove anything, but I didn't hear the air come on. Well as time went by it just became normal life. Things got thrown we'd just be like ""Be quiet Philbert"". Now I'll say I didn't feel anything malicious from it, it just felt more like it wanted attention, to be seen and heard. So, I made a decision one night that I may come to regret, but I don't as of yet. I invited it home with us. I told it that if it was lonely here it could follow us home. 

Of course by the time we had closed I'd forgotten about it. I was sitting next to the side door waiting in my car for my boyfriend to finish up. As I was sitting there I heard a metallic clunk, like someone pulling and letting go of the door handle. Then, rustling in the backseat. I immediately remembered what I'd said and although I did mean it, I didn't think it'd actually follow us home. I told my boyfriend about it when he got to the car. I don't remember the conversation we had but soon after that we started having experiences at home.

Electronics would turn on by themselves, we'd constantly lose things (items on the bed would just disappear). No footprints, but I put that down to not having constantly greasy tile like what was in the store. I remember once I asked Philbert to turn on the PlayStation for me. I know PlayStations can turn themselves on sometimes like my boyfriend pointed out when it did turn on seconds later. That's when I looked and noticed a controller on. It was about 5 feet from me and 3 feet from my boyfriend, on a clothes pile against a wall. I was like ""It wasn't the PlayStation, he used the controller to turn it on."" And I pointed over at it. Another time we were just sitting around watching TV. We have these soup cans that we put cigarette butts and ashes in. It was sitting in front of me and suddenly with a thump it flipped over onto its head. Like someone flicked the bottom of it. I was like ""Did you see that?"" ""Yup."" Thinking about it, it could have been a spring in the mattress, but I find that unlikely as we have a very thick memory foam layer in our mattress.

Eventually I got so used to it I forgot about it. Not completely, I just didn't think about it all the time anymore. I stopped talking to it. It recently crossed my mind to post somewhere my story as it's gotten different lately. The last few weeks my boyfriend and I get random scratches and I tend to get headaches every night about midnight. I don't find it scary or even threatening. I think it just got tired of not getting any attention. We're currently in the process of moving, so I'm kind of just waiting it out and seeing if it follows us to the new house."
"A Ghostly Farmer","Oregon","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","This goes back to 1995. I was 13 years old and with me were my 2 younger bothers. The field was sold and developed soon after my experience also, which further hints that the farmer passed away and the land was sold at the last harvest (which was cut at this point in time of my incident). 

The street name is Lambert St. Nw. Any address is irrelevant. It's quite obvious on Google maps where the new homes and older homes connect.

 (West) Salem Oregon, approximately 8:30 pm. The neighborhood was built on wheat fields and possibly other crops in the 1980's. I lived on a short dead end road, one house away from the end of the road, which immediately began the wheat field. The last house after mine, lived an elderly couple. The husband had a bad stroke and had difficulties mentally afterward. A wonderful man too. My ghostly incident happened on the edge of his property line and the field. 

My brothers and I liked going to the muck water that built up at the far corner of the farmers field, day and night to attempt catching frogs. This night I grabbed our big flashlight and the three of us boys went on our usual walk through the rough terrain, toward our destination, only to be stopped in our tracks by a VERY detailed entity that was literally an elderly man who looked like he was in his farmer clothing (stereotypical look from the ""old days""). I noticed this in absolute shock as I raised my flashlight directly into the mass of this ""fog"" standing in front of us, standing still and feeling like we were being stared at. I said, ""hello?"" When there was no response, all three of us darted back into our house, the looks of horror on our faces. I could feel the fear running though me as I desperately pleaded with my pops to come outside and see this! He laughed at first, due to me crying wolf about a fake sighting I told him about in the past, after he swore he saw the exact type of entity at the opposite end of our street, one house down the opposite way of the field, at the stop sign. 

He finally followed us out to look and, of course, nothing.

I cannot forget the feelings I experienced, never. I can still see the ""ghost"" in my head clearly to this day.

About 2021, I would drive through this same area as a graveyard hours job almost nightly. There was a couple times I would pull over and stand in the exact same spot, which is now a house side yard, with a tree planted in the spot where the entity ""stood"". A friendly cat would wander out to me and rub up on my leg as I would stand out there. I'm sure it was just coincidental. 

I was so close to this ghost that I could have reached into it with my hand. 

As I read through my experience, it sounds too good to be true. I feel very blessed, having the opportunity to see such a life-changing event.

I think children carry the ability to see ghosts. We grow up and out of this 'sense'. Some do not though, which is even more exciting. If I had a chance to do it over again, I think I would still react the same way as I did back as a child, scared out of my mind.

It may be the reason that my hair went gray early in life? That's a joke and probably also coincidental!"
"Out Of The Gloom In Gladstone","Oregon","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","In Multnohmah County, the city of Gladstone on the whole has a very weird vibe, like a bomb site or a slave plantation. When I lived there it was a pretty neighborhood on the riverbank, with big yards and nice trees. I believe this lingering gloom is because of some forty thousand Multnohmah people who died of smallpox. The whole scene there, of Gladstone, and old downtown Oregon City is always so forlorn, for such a busy, picture-postcard area.

This incident happened in 2000 or 2001. If grim historical fact comes into play, it is more likely that of people freezing to death beneath overpasses in modern shanty camps. I avoided the easy bike route along the I-205 after dark, just in case you wonder, in part because of these hidden camps, but mostly because of the people who prey on them.

Years before I lived in a little house there, I would ride my bike home through Gladstone, east over the hill, when I stayed with ""Marco's"" grandmama. There were two routes over the high ridge. One was a steep, blind intersection, tricky either way. Even in daylight, riding or walking my bike up that hill was not safe. I worked at a cinema, and usually got home around three a.m.

 (In any case, I kept an eye out being alone after most traffic and all the good people were off the roads. I am always armed, but the only trouble I have ever had has been from the police. I am not afraid of anyone else. So, I always ride super legally, with a headlamp, and two headlights, plus taillights, on the bike itself. There are bike lanes/routes, and it is legal for bikes to take the whole proper lane on roads with less than 35 mph limit.) 

So, I picked the longer way over the ridge. This was a wide, well-lit residential two-way, with parking and painted bike lanes on both sides. This wide street went straight and very steep for about eight blocks. One could see all the way up to the top of the hill. Even in the rain, I could pick a mailbox, or a jeep or something, and set a goal to pedal at least that far up the incline. As weeks passed I made it a little farther every time I tried.

One very wet, dark winter night after work, the residents had put out their bins, blocking off the bike lanes. It was probably around 1 a.m., so after spotting on a red truck parked halfway up the hill, I began huffing and puffing right up the middle of the auto lane. I made it to the red truck. The road ahead was clear. I did not want to give up yet. 

My hoodie was steaming in the streetlights, a buttery topping-flavoured halo of my own warmth. There was no wind. It was so quiet I could hear the water flowing downhill over the blacktop, every individual tooth of my chain on each gear. My own blood was loudest in my ears. I weaved a little, trying to maintain momentum. Not exactly the Grand Prix.

I was struggling very slowly, standing up on my pedals. I looked down into the fog of one breath, and when I looked back up, he was suddenly there, motionless at my right hand. If he had been real I would have hit him, I should have knocked into him. I swerved and almost tipped off my bike, heaved sideways uphill, into him. But there was no impact, somehow.

He did not move, and stared me straight in the eye as I passed within a breath of him. There was no fog from his breathing. He had shaggy, light hair, with a long mustache. He was all pale grey, like ash or snowy, but not reflecting wetly in my headlamp or the streetlights, as one should. He had no smell or warmth. His eyes were desperate. He looked bone cold. That downward pedal's worth of a moment seemed like several minutes, but it was less than a blink of time. He could have grabbed me if he were trying to, as I wobbled in toward him. I looked right in his eyes. He was so cold.

I was so scared I did not look behind to see if the pale figure was following me, or even really there. God rest him. I can barely remember correcting the bike, or getting home. I only know that was the only time I ever pedaled all the way up and over that hill; and the last time I rode home along the East side of the Willamette, through Gladstone, after dark. 

I would prefer that this was a person picking trash, who caught me by surprise. But as I swerved, they would have either jumped back instinctively, or reached to brace himself/catch me. How were they suddenly in the middle of the road? I should have hit them, would have smelled someone that close, and felt his body heat. His smallest breath should have been like smoke, like mine.

Also, I would have seen his breath, then simply rode up the (downhill) opposite side of the street, from the bottom of the hill. A person in a blanket, picking trash in the wee hours, would not have been frightening in the time before fentanyl."
"The Strange Crash In The Kitchen","Rhode Island","Haunted Places","My friend recently moved into the attic of a home in suburban Rhode Island, not far away from Providence. The home is that same Folk Victorian style you see all throughout the northeastern United States. The home consists of of three levels: the ground level, the second floor, and the third floor/attic space, all of which are converted into units designed for one family in each. My friend lives in the top level of the home. 

My friend is very spiritually attuned, as am I, and prior to moving into the house, she had sent me photos of it right after signing the lease to see if I got any inkling of spiritual energy in the photos. Neither of us did. The home was built in 1900 so it makes sense for there to be residual energy, but it was not readily perceptible. Unlike the other homes I have written about in my other stories, there was no feeling of being watched, no feeling of heaviness and no oppressive feeling. So the little things we began to notice surprised us. 

For context of the layout of the unit in which she lived: The door to outside was in the kitchen, which led to wooden stairs that ran along the side of the house outside to the ground level. Off the kitchen was a small hallway with three rooms attached: my friend's room, her kids' room, and the bathroom, and a door that led to the stairs to the second floor of the house. This was the entirety of her level of the home, it was tiny and standing in the hallway you could see into every single room in the house. 

The first time I visited the home, we were in her room watching television around 10:00 at night, and suddenly we both heard a crashing sound from the kitchen. It sounded like a ceramic plate had fallen and hit the floor and shattered. Her dog and two cats were all in the room with us and they heard it too, as the dog began growling and the cats darted under the bed. We immediately ran into the kitchen, confused as to what had fallen, but nothing was out of place. We checked every cabinet, every corner of the kitchen to see if something had fallen but it had not. We were very confused, but nothing else happened so we put it out of our minds and went to bed. 

One week later, she called me to tell me that she heard the same noise again, around the same time and that her daughters and the animals had heard it, too. Just as before, there was no sign of anything out of place or broken in the kitchen. She also told me that one time when she was home alone with her daughters, she was in the kitchen and saw movement down the hallway toward the bathroom, and she assumed it was her daughter but a few minutes later, both daughters came into the kitchen from the opposite direction. There was no one in the bathroom when she checked. On my next visit to the house we tried as best we could to recreate the sound in the kitchen to determine what it was, but we were unable. Nothing we could clank together or drop would recreate the sound we heard.

One of her daughters said that she saw items levitating in the kitchen. One of her art projects was sitting on the microwave, it was a clay figurine she made in school. She saw it levitate, the head get torn off, and then both fall to the ground all mid-air. Not long after, items began to turn up in unexpected places. Keys would go missing, wallets, clothing items, all to turn up hours later in the most random of places. 

After a while my friend stated that she would get home and just feel drained of energy, like she needed to sleep for hours and like the energy was sucked right out of her. She became so concerned by it that she set up an appointment with her doctor to see if there is a medical cause, but I have felt this, too, in the house. The noise has not been heard since, but my friend says that her youngest daughter is petrified of one of the closets in her room and says something ""evil"" lives in there. She also is refusing to sleep in her own room. Everyone is perplexed by these occurrences.

The house is across the street from a cemetery. I am wondering if that could be the cause."
"Spooked In Portland","Oregon","Haunted Places","Many years ago I was part of the Portland restaurant scene, working and partying after hours in haunted buildings around the PDX- Metro area. It would be very interesting to see if anyone else had similar haunting experiences, back in the day. 

In Portland, my favorite haunted place you could still visit, is an historic movie theater where I have volunteered sometimes. All of Portland's historic theaters are wonderful spots to visit for that certain supernatural thrill, as well as some more modern cinemas in the suburbs.

I have come to enjoy the neighborly type spooks that seem to hang out at these spots. Or at bars like The Belmont Inn, Moe's or Embers, looking for a good time. I have shivered walking past the darkened old-west dance halls, but have only been frightened to go near a few places like the old brick pioneer jail, when I lived downtown. That building was terrifying to walk close to, or even look at. I don't know if any of those places still stand.

The second level of the Galleria shopping mall is someplace I would never go back to for a million dollars, even if it was still open. It feels like the mouth of hell. The Burlingame neighborhood also makes me intensely uncomfortable. Mount Tabor Park has always given me the awful creeps, but that may be because it is a live volcano within city limits. 

Here are some more Portland haunts:

At twenty years old, I was a barista for a Halloween charity, all-ages rave, held in the building which used to be the City Night Club. It was apparently under renovation. I was new to town. I am not sure when the club had shuttered, but the old club furniture and a lot of bar junk was still there. It was a very casual gig, a favor for a coworker, and I was stoked to attend. Halloween is my favorite holiday.

I had never been there. I did not expect dirty floors and rigged lights showing holes in walls from old equipment, and tore out wiring everywhere. It felt old but had nineties decor. Possible squatters. My coworker was there early, to set up. More people we knew were expected to party until late.

I came in and followed upstairs, the back way, before dark. Someone took me through to an espresso bar set up next to piles of dusty half-trashed club junk in one of the open spaces for dancing. We had to go through some narrow, dirty service corridors which came out by an old bar top. I could see out the windows to the street front of the building at the tops of trees, until it got dark. Everything was all set up, so I just stared out the window waiting for the deejay to start the party. 

The longer I was there, I became so lonely and sad. I kept thinking about just jumping out those windows. Or just laying down behind one of the big amps, to die unnoticed. I was in despair, even though I love to dance and dress up. I actually closed down about an hour after the music began. Everyone else was having fun. My friends and the party were great. The night was young, my outfit was foxy, and I wanted to get the hell out. The walls felt like they wanted me out, too.

I had friends who rented in places so haunted, I am not sure how they stayed. One place was in this gorgeous, huge old boarding hostel, near NW Vaughn. It was all original wood and had these terrific wide staircases. It smelled like only old wood buildings can. The rooms were clean, with nice big windows. Each floor had shared washrooms with private showers and toilet cubbies. Once when I had to wander out alone, late at night, I became suddenly very much aware of someone I couldn't see. It was like having a pal ""along to powder her nose"". I barely slept whenever I was visiting.

I had friends in a tall apartment building on Alder, by the church. The ancient cage elevator in that apartment building is very ""crowded"". 

I used to walk to and from work, faster past the scary old Civic Apartments. I only went inside them once, which was deathly uncomfortable, especially the hallways, like visiting a morgue. I wish I had not. I am glad they were torn down.

I really disliked walking within a block or two of the train tunnel in Goose Hollow, but I otherwise adored that neighborhood late at night. Every shadow seems aware, and the streetlights are lovely on the trees in the rain. I liked living there.

In Old Town, there used to be rooms for rent, above the Satyricon Club, where one never felt alone when one should. Not in a bad way, just how old buildings are ""busy"" sometimes. Like someone came back to make sure the kettle is off, and stayed for your company. 

My friend who lived there was a fishmonger at an upscale market off NW 21st. It was a bright, busy place, in a small brick building which was very extra ""loud"", especially after the customers you can see had left.

I lived in several supposedly haunted houses, but never anywhere scary. One person I knew had a ghost which would spoon her, and comfort her if she cried. No thank you. She lived north of Burnside, near Stark, in an upper apartment.

I worked the bar for two lunch shifts at a downtown restaurant called Fernando's Hideaway, trying very hard to avoid looking into the mirrored wall. After just two trips to the dirt-finished hella Hella HELLA creepy basement, during one agonized solo shift where I was actively dodging around certain weird spots on the second floor, I called my old boss on the east side and begged her for my job back.

I was just fine with whatever haunted her restaurant. It sometimes said hello, especially to any red haired female staff, and seemed to hang around upstairs mostly. That's where the projection booth had been, before the theater became two busy restaurants and the army recruiter office. To me, the connecting rear hallway was sort of ""extra dark"", although always lit. I have only been on the army side a few times, and always just quickly running food. I never discussed the haunt with the cafe crew next door, either. Our haunt was very fond of one certain hostess, and had touched her, said hello to her by name. I always just hollered out a general greeting whenever I was first in the door, making certain to ""peace"" out as well. The haunt would tease one feisty chef, hiding her knives, and she'd swear at it under her breath. No one was ever scared though-it was a family place. I miss that building.

My first job downtown was as a shift supervisor for a bakery at 6th and Alder. I always felt like there was something hanging out in the back room near the prep table. My friend ""Max"" worked there, too. We would get off work at 2 in the afternoon, and start drinking. One of our favorite spots was a Chinese place a few blocks away. It was called the Gateway Lounge then, over time it has had many names. It even was a set, in a teevee show ""Stumptown"". 

This was a gorgeous, dark bluish stone building with original long hardwood bar tops, and fancy brass trim. It was a hot music spot at night, then a slow corner bar for lunch. Just us punters, watching sunbeams through the legs of upturned chairs. As we got into our cups he would casually tell me things like, ""our bakery is haunted"", ""this place is haunted"", or ""I choose this table so my back is to the ghost by the kitchen door."" I cannot find it on street view, because now there's a new high-rise, I think. I never went there without another real person, even though I really enjoyed the general atmosphere. 

The buildings which used to be bath houses on Stark Street all seem haunted to me, which I have visited. The spaces which were Roxy's and Cassidy's also always made me feel like I had company who I could not see, but in a friendly sort of way. I only went to Paul's Fish House once, and felt nothing off. Then, years later I went to a job interview in the upstairs part of that same block, and left before they called my name. Something about the place felt sinister and wrong, even in bright daylight, like the white plaster work on the columns was hungry.

Anyway, those are a few Portland stories from back in my day. I hope you have enjoyed reading them. Please comment why, if you also remember these places as spooked as I do."
"It's The Little Things","Idaho","Haunted Places","We moved into this trailer almost 10 years ago and while we have not experienced a huge spook, we have had a little bite here and there. The first few months of living in the trailer were the norm. One day, I was extremely tired and decided to go lay across the bed. I had been having an uneasy feeling that day, so I knew I just needed to relax. As I lay there I felt an evil presence and I started to sing ""Jesus Loves Me"". With my eyes closed and singing this song, I heard this awful sound. It sounded as if someone recorded a baby crying and then played it backward. The next thing I knew, I felt a ""Swoosh"" and ""it"" flew over my head and out of the room. The ""evil"" feeling left and I went into a peaceful sleep.

 A few weeks later, I was pulling the car out of our driveway not really thinking of anything when all of a sudden I caught a glimpse of something. There was something at the back corner of our trailer. I rubbed my eyes and looked again. I know I saw a little girl smiling at me and then she was not there, so weird. Come to find out that some 20-odd years ago, there was a little girl who had drowned in the lake that is located behind our trailer. It happened so quickly that I questioned myself several times. When I heard the story, I knew that I had experienced something. 

 Then there are the little things... Scraping of a chair being slid across the floor (I was by myself and in the other room); Shadows; being touched; three to five knocks on the door or wall (this has only happened a few times, enough to make you go hmmmmmmm.) And just that feeling that you are not alone.

 I guess whoever our visitors are, they're going to have to deal with the living, because rent is cheap, we're old and we are not moving...LOL"
"Little Gifts Out Of Nowhere","Ohio","Misc","Those of you whom have read my accounts are aware of the fact that I am a widow that was married to a truly wonderful man. The love of my life. However, I realize that I'm not the first, nor will I be the last widow on this planet, but on with this account.

It was only a couple months after my dear husband's passing. My mother-in-law, Mary, had been departed for a few years at the time this happened. I'm mentioning Mary for a reason, as you'll soon see. John, and I were very fond of World War II documentaries that they would show on WVIZ, a special television channel with what we called intellectual programs to watch. They would, also, offer those programs on VHS tape/DVD that you could order. John, and I were considering ordering this one documentary on the war with Germany when his condition worsened, and he became extremely weak, and ill. From there he was in, and out of the hospital, and rehab. Nursing homes for over a year until he passed. I was extremely depressed, and distraught. It was all I could do to focus on day to day obligations. Such as going to work, and paying the bills. 

As I said before, a couple months had gone by. One day I came home from work to find a box leaning up against the apartment door. It had my name on it, and was from WVIZ T.V. In Boston. What? I was perplexed, but I took it inside, and opened it to find the exact DVD documentary about the war that John, and I had 'wanted' to order, but I never did. I couldn't see ordering something that 'he' wasn't there to share with, and enjoy it with me. Why bother? I called the 800 number for the station the next day, and inquired as to 'who' ordered it, and when? All the woman could tell me was that it 'was' ordered about three weeks ago, and paid for. How could that be? I didn't order it. She could only say, ""well, you have it now, and it's been paid for. Enjoy it!"".

I did mention in my first story about the haunted house we lived in in Willoughby, how items would disappear into thin air only to turn up much later in the most unlikely places. They are called apports, but I wasn't sure about 'this'.

Now to Mary, my mother-in-law. Years before while they were both still around, John, and I went to visit Mary. She didn't live but a few minutes away up the road in a mobile home. John was outside mowing her lawn for her, and Mary, and I were inside. Mary was going through her jewelry box. If you're a woman you have one of those, too. She claimed that it was getting cluttered, and she was rearranging it while we were there. She took this lovely broach out, and laid it on the coffee table. It had tiny orange/gold/yellow/brown mosaic tiles that formed the picture of flowers against an orange background. I was admiring it. She noticed. She asked me if ""I"" liked it. I told her that I did. She, then, asked if I would wear it, to which I answered that I would. She said that when she passed that she wanted me to have it. However, I told her to stick around because I loved her, and I wasn't all that anxious to receive a piece of jewelry. She chuckled, and said she'd stick around as long as possible, but that she 'did' want me to have it.

Of course, she did pass at 82 years old, but I never gave the least bit of thought to that broach. Here is where it gets amazing. I got that movie disc first. Then a week later, whilst cleaning the place, and straightening out the slip-cover on my couch, I found that very broach laying on one of the couch cushions. Yikes! Where did 'that' come from?

I was overwhelmed. I just had to sit down, and start crying. I mean crying very hard. I was trying to find a reasonable explanation for these two items that just came out of nowhere. I had to talk to Beth, my sister-in-law. Her, and I were extremely close. We talked at great length about it. It was Beth who came to the conclusion that those items were, in fact, gifts from John, and Mary since they 'knew' how much I wanted, or liked them. I wanted to argue the point, but I couldn't. I just couldn't dispute it because it 'did' make some sense. Beth believes that they 'are' gifts from them, and ""I"", likewise, want to believe that, also. 

My family never knew about the movie disc that we wanted to order, or the broach. No one knew. Only John, Mary, and myself knew about them. I don't know if you can call what happened apports because I'm not too sure they fit into that category. Therefore, I have more, or less, accepted the fact that they are gifts from John, and Mary. I'll treasure them forever as such. Let me know what you think!"
"The Old Mansion By The Side Of The Road","Pennsylvania","Haunted Places","A very long time ago in the Summer of 1966-67, we were visiting with my grandparents, and other family members that came in from Louisiana. My Uncle Eddy, and Aunt Rosemary came with six of their twelve kids for an overnight visit. We were there for a weekend hiatus also.

Of the six of the cousins, only two were about my age. Eddy Jr. Was just a year younger, while the eldest, Rosemary, was my age, twelve. We often would enjoy taking long walks along the beautiful country roads. My grandparents lived in a fairly rural region with lots of farms, and plenty of room between the houses. The nearest neighbor was half a mile away. So, those conditions afforded families relative privacy. It was very nice out there. 

We wanted to go to a particular ice-cream parlor called Twin-Kiss, and we wanted to enjoy the walk there. Our parents forked out the money. A quarter each. Can you believe a dime, or a quarter for a decent sized ice-cream cone back then? It's true! Off on our much anticipated journey we went. It was a bit of a hike along a long paved road just outside of Ellwood City, PA., but it was pretty clear of traffic most of the time, and we'd pet the horses, or cows grazing along the sides of the fences as we went. 

There was a very old abandoned mansion along the side, and set back a couple hundred yards from the road. It sat right across the street from a Dairy Farm. 

We were always told by the local kids that that mansion was haunted. Of course, 'that' made us wonder. Wonder lead to curiosity. Curiosity lead to almost getting shot by a farmer. Allow me to explain.

We were on our way back from the ice-cream parlor, and had devoured our ice-cream cones. We were coming up on the mansion. I'm sure that, in it's heyday, it was a very beautiful building to behold. Rather like a smaller version of Tara from Gone With the Wind, if you can picture that. It was solid white, had four floors, a cellar, and was surrounded on all sides by a veranda-like porch with the main entrance in the middle of the porch. Very charming. However, the porch looked like it was about to collapse if anyone put their weight on it. Not wanting to take chances we managed to find an old laundry tub, turned it upside down, and stood on it to peer inside the house on the first floor.

From the little we could see it must've been very grand in it's time. We noticed some old Victorian furniture with the fancy upholstery, and intricate carvings on the arms, and legs. There was a lot of other furniture that was covered with sheets that were almost blackened from the dust, and grime on them. It was getting near dusk, and the outside light was diminishing slightly. While we were gazing in through the window, we heard a loud noise coming from the floor above. Possibly one, or two floors up. It sounded like someone pushing chairs out of the way, or dragging them along the floor. It alarmed us, and we jumped off of the wash tub, and started running away from the house. For some reason we all stopped, and turned around to see who, or what it was. We wanted to assure ourselves that whomever wasn't pursuing us. Really, that was rather stupid of us. We just should've kept running, but, like I said, curiosity took over. 

As we stood there we noticed a bright light moving on the third floor of the mansion. It was moving like someone carrying a lantern, but we didn't see anyone 'carrying' it. Just the light. We were observing through the many broken windows. While we were just standing there, we were all very startled by a farmer coming up behind us with a shot-gun (Just to scare us. I don't believe he would've shot a bunch of kids.). However, he 'did' get our attention, to put it mildly. He yelled at us, and told us that his family 'owned' the mansion/property, and that we were trespassing. We apologized-extremely humbly, I might add-and informed him that there 'was' somebody that was already trespassing, and walking around in the upstairs of the house. We told him that we could see whomever it was carrying a lantern on the upper floor. He got a bit irate, and told us we must've been imagining things because the last member of his family died in there well over fifty-some years ago, and it's been empty ever since. He said there's no electricity on in there either. My two other cousins, and myself protested that 'we' were too old to be imagining things-one eleven year old, and two twelve year olds-right. We proclaimed that we 'all' saw it, and were watching it when he came up behind us. We must've been watching for about five minutes when he arrived.

He lowered his gun, much to 'our' relief. He said, rather sternly, that it was time for clarification. He went ahead of us, and asked us to follow him. He managed to 'walk' up on the front porch. Considering his size we didn't see how he felt sure it wasn't going to crumble under him, but he did. He told us it was alright to come up, and look inside. We, very gingerly, mounted the wooden steps, and peered inside on his urging. What we saw just knocked us off our feet. Yes, there was a huge set of stairs with a fancy banister going up, but the floors were gone. Rotted away. No one could walk up there because there 'weren't any' floors to walk on. Not to mention the stairs were partially rotted away as well.

We all went pale. He asked us if we were satisfied. We nodded our heads, apologized, and he escorted us out. He told us to go home, and not to trespass on his property in the future. He even apologized for alarming us with the gun. The gun was the last thing on our minds as we trekked back home to grandma and grandpa's. We were all discussing it rather excitedly, and 'trying' to make some sense out of what we saw.

However, we were stumped as to what happened. We all agreed not to mention it to our parents. Besides, who would believe a bunch of kids? That was 'our' logic at the time. We, secretly, talked about it for the remainder of the visit. Just 'what' did we witness? As for the owners of the property, and the mansion, they have erected an electric fence around the property behind which their dairy cows graze. On that fence is a big metal sign with a warning 'no trespassing'. To this day, that incident still has some of us scratching our heads. I welcome any, and all comments!"
"Staying At Grandpa's House","New York","Haunted Places","When I was a boy, one of my favorite places to spend at least part of the weekend was with my grandpa! He was my mom's father and lived in a bigger town less than 10 miles away from us in upstate NY. I have fond memories of family reunions and spending time as kids up there. He had an old toy box of toys we could play with in the house or out on the patio in the sand pile. They were older toys from when my parent's were kids, but they were fascinating, especially the ones made of tin. He lived on a dead end loop and we played stick ball on that road since there weren't many cars coming through. He spoiled us in many ways and even had a bowl of M&M's he kept tucked away on the top of a cabinet in the dining room that he shared with us (apparently mom didn't even know about it!) 

Many weekends I would go stay with him on Friday nights, my grandmother had died a few years earlier, so he lived alone and loved the company. Mom had told me I was his favorite (maybe because she gave me his first name as my middle name) I would stay up until 10 or so watching Prime time television and eating ice cream sundaes! The kind of stuff you can do at the grandparents but not so much at home!

The place was old, with one of those floor furnaces, the ones with grates in the rooms and one big floor grate in another room, in this case the end of the kitchen. There was a dug out cellar below and a cramped second floor he closed off in the winter's to conserve heat. He slept in a converted front room downstairs behind the living room and I would sleep out on the couch in the living room. Though he lived at the end of the dead end loop, just across the fence outside the living room was the 4 lane. It was actually what ended up cutting the road off and was the main traffic lane for the town/city. There were constantly cars going by, so between that and the street lights, the room was fairly lit, even with shades and blinds.

It was a joyful place to spend time, but at night things changed after lights out and it was kind of creepy being left alone during the day as well. That didn't happen often as there were constantly people coming and going, always visitors, like the house on North Street it was a family place.

Though my grandfather was snoozing only one room over, I always felt a sense of anxiety at night, with no discernible reason. I would roll over facing the back of the couch, so as not to see anything. I felt watched somehow and it was unsettling. The living room felt fairly safe, but there was still an air about the place. Whatever I picked up on seemed to be right at the entrance to the room, at the end of the hall, something or someone watching and waiting. The hall and kitchen and even passing the stairs in the dark to use the bathroom, well it was a bit of a race. There was also something about walking past that cellar door in the hall. I would try to hold it if I could. Many could dismiss this as normal childhood fears, but I didn't feel that way at home. True I didn't live at Grandpa's house, but I spent enough time there, it was like a second home. I also did not watch anything scary prior to bedtime, I was adverse to that stuff, my Friday nights were all about an hour long family friendly action-comedy and ice cream sundaes! I would later be granted a flashlight to use, but it was unnerving to go to the bathroom at night, I felt as if something was there, just beyond my field of vision in the shadows waiting to leap out at me. Once I was in the bathroom, it felt like I was in a safe space. Such a strange shift in energy, but the bathroom felt safe. Mom would tell me years later I would complain 'of seeing things in the dark' but I don't remember what? Occasionally, I would catch a flitting movement out of the corner of my eye, especially on the stairs leading to the second floor. 

Sometimes I wouldn't really sleep until nearly dawn, when the sky would lighten and suddenly the oppressive air to the place seemed to fade, especially when Grandpa would get up and bustle about fixing breakfast (I could have anything I wanted, one time he even let me try a cup of coffee). Grandpa made everything feel safer and better! Despite the nights of near terror, The time spent there was worth it, so I put up with it, at least until I got older and developed other interests. 

This strange house and those early experiences culminated in an encounter one day which really shook me. It was late morning and my grandfather had left me alone while he went out to take care of some personal business and bring back some fast food (another personal treat to spending time there) I was alone in the living room and again those strange feelings arose. It was daylight though and I shook them off. It seemed to build this time and even though I continued to ignore and play with some toys, I heard a loud creak in the floor at the far end of the hall, at the entrance to the kitchen. No big deal, as the house always groaned and creaked, it was old. It didn't stop there though. The noises in the floor sounded down the hall loudly, as if a heavy person were walking down the hall towards the living room. It was rhythmic, there's no mistaking that sound. We always knew when someone had entered the house to visit because the floor made the same sound when anyone walked down it, the sounds varying only by their size (kids made less noise by weight than adults) I looked up sharply and stopped playing. I couldn't believe this, I saw absolutely nothing, yet something was making its way down the hall towards me and not quietly either! My nerve broke and I bolted, I couldn't use the hall, as it was 'occupied' and running around through the dining room would have taken me past the stairs and I was already creeped out. The front door was in my grandpa's room, and the closest way out, so as ""it"" entered the living room, I fled the house via that exit and waited on the curb for my grandfather to return, trying all the while to rationalize what had just happened. Again like night and day, I felt the change as soon as I left the house, the feeling outdoors was completely different, friendly, noticeably nicer than the darker air of the house. I was scared but I still noticed the energy shift. I have always been sensitive to energy, I just never really understood it until I was an adult. When grandpa came back I sort of gave him a lame excuse but did make it clear being left alone in there was creepy. I was sort of embarrassed at how I reacted, because outside everything felt different and I believe I overreacted. I stopped my overnight stays shortly after that.

It wouldn't be until years later that I may have found some probable cause to what happened or what was there. My Grandfather's house was old but unremarkable. It was a very simple place that my grandfather had added onto when he acquired it, including digging out the basement and adding most of the upstairs. No deaths there, nor at least not any that were talked about. My grandfather, though of Irish descent, didn't really seem to believe in an afterlife.

When my brother and I were teens we found an old Ouija board in the upstairs of the garage at my childhood home, still in it's box. Again I didn't really watch horror movies until I was almost 20, I only had an slight idea of what we had found. My brother though had seen all kinds of stuff a kid his age probably shouldn't be watching, so he knew much more about what we had found. When we opened the box, we found the board was worn and old. We also found a bunch or scribbled notes, someone had apparently transcribed the sessions, similar to a secretary taking down the minutes at a board meeting. Looking back on it, I wish I read through them more carefully, but I was more interested in the board. I only recall someone's name mentioned that I didn't recognize and some reference to drugs. 

It was full daylight and under my brother's instruction we sat down in the lower level of the garage and proceeded to 'contact the dead' I was fascinated but sort of unassuming about the whole affair, so when nothing seemed to be happening I decided to have some fun. Applying only slight pressure I moved the planchette where I wanted to spell out what I wanted and attempted to convince my brother and his friend that we had contacted the ghost of a man who had disappeared from the area many years ago. The man may have been murdered after a poker game gone bad, but a body was never found and the mystery remained. Either way, my brother was familiar with the story. I spelled out that the body was buried beneath our garage and I was pretty convincing, though I admit, at the time, other than goofing off I had no idea what I was doing or with what. I later admitted to what I had done, it was all in fun for me. My brother wanted more convincing evidence and believed taking it to a place considered full of spirits, the local cemetery would yield better results. I KNEW this was a bad idea, I could feel it and washed my hands of any further involvement. 

My brother and his friends went to the cemetery and returned in short order visibly shaken. He was pale and withdrawn and to this day I cannot get him to speak about what happened there. He apparently went to my grandmother's grave (mom's mother) Whatever happened was pretty bad, and from what little I saw of the notes included with the board, I knew it had belonged to my mother. So I left the board on the kitchen table with the intent to question her about it when she got home. We never used the board in the house at all, only the garage. When mom got home, she flipped out when she saw it. She thought my dad had gotten rid of it, but her idea of getting rid of it and his, apparently were different. She ordered it out of the house and coupled with my brother's bizarre behavior, I took it out to the garage, opened the door a little ways and tossed it in there and closed the door again.

Later when my mom calmed down she revealed the origin of the board and her strong responses to it. She and her siblings had used the board at Grandpa's when they were young. The name in the notes I didn't recognize, was the dead sister of one of her friends and the reference to the drugs was a probable cause of death, or at least played into it. They had used the board quite regularly and she had become familiar with the spirit of the board, who she said later threatened her physically. They stopped using it after that, but strange things started happening at the house. She confirmed the same odd feelings I had shared in my time there and only told me of a few personal instances. One being 'knowing' someone was standing in the doorway of their upstairs bedroom one night. Another was she woke up to something sitting on the end of the bed in that same room one night. She didn't get a good look at it in the dark, but it curled up into a ball and rolled up the bed, passing through her and into the wall. She said it was a really bizarre feeling. This would explain the reason why I had a bad feeling of being watched emanating from the upstairs. She had thought my aunts had some kind of experiences as well, but they wouldn't talk about it.

That same night, my brother continued to get more paranoid because of what he had experienced, which he still wouldn't tell me about. He asked to stay in my room for the night and his hysterics had me half convinced that if I looked out my window at the garage, I would see glowing, flashing lights of some vengeful spirit out there, like something he described in one of his movies. Seeing the awful affect it was having on him, I was determined to go out to the garage in the morning and get rid of the thing myself. Enough was enough, I wasn't sure of what to make of my mother's story and what had happened to my brother, but what had started out as curiosity and a game had changed into something more sinister and had gone too far. 

When I opened the garage door that next morning, there was nothing there. The board was gone. My mom thought maybe dad had finally gotten rid of it like she originally wanted (especially after she lit into him when she found out it was still around) However, in the short time that elapsed between last evening and that morning and if you knew how slowly my father took care of things, this seems unlikely. That and he never admitted to it, like he didn't know what we were talking about? My brother told me that years later he found the board again in the garage, but wouldn't touch it. Like before, it disappeared when he went to show me?

I don't know what to make of that, but as near as I can figure, apparently my mother, her friends and siblings, in their tinkering with the metaphysical world, opened some kind of portal in my grandfather's house that remained behind years later, when I encountered it. There's of course the board with a mind of it's own, that hopefully is gone for good. I say that, because when my parent's pass, I inherit the house and the garage is full of the junk they've accumulated and I'll end up being the one who has to go through it, so if it's still out there... It's been many years, my grandfather passed, and his house sold off to another branch of the family whom we don't really know well and who seem to have completely rehabbed the placed and live in it currently. It only somewhat resembles what I remember of it. I can still clearly remember how bizarre it was, the safe energy pockets in that place, like night and day. Places like the bathroom, and for the most part the kitchen, dining room and living room, the energy felt so much better in those spaces. The upstairs, was off as was the basement and that hall, it was like walking through some sort of energy force field and very noticeable!"
"Fathers Passing... And Return","South Carolina","Family / Friends Visits","Hey everyone, 

 It's been quite sometime time since I've been on here.

I kind of stepped away from the paranormal for a while when my dad's cancer came back. That's the reason I'm writing this, to share the experiences I've had during and after the dying process. For anyone that's been next to a loved one that was dying, they may agree that many strange occurrences happen.

 In February of 2021 my dad went in to have his vocal cords removed due to cancer. The operation was successful. Things were tough due to communication issues, but he was alive and seemed to be healthier than ever. That's all that matters.

 Unfortunately that following November when he went in to get his second follow up biopsy, they found that his cancer had metastasized to his right kidney and in the course of the three month gap between biopsies it progressed to stage 4. 

 On the night of June 17, 2022 my mom texted me that my dad said he was going. I rushed over. He held on for seven more days. 

 During those days the atmosphere felt so heavy. Even while alone it always felt like you were in a crowded room. You'd hear someone pacing the hallway when everyone at the house was in my father's room. You'd hear faint conversations when no one was talking. Doors that would be opened after you know you closed them.

 One night we were all with my dad sharing memories and joking around to keep the mood as light as you can in such a situation. The basic stuff. I was leaning against my mom's dresser when I felt something hit me lightly on the side of my bicep. I look all around me to find what it was. Nothing. So I ask if someone just threw something at me. No one said they did. The best way to describe what it felt like was if someone took a balled up piece of paper and played with it until it was very soft and tossed it at you. After discussing it, we all seemed to realize at the same time that my grandmother used to playfully punch me in that same spot. It gave me both chills and joy at the thought she was saying hey.

 Another encounter happened to my younger sister, she was in her room when she suddenly smelt burning sage and then sweet grass. Then she heard a man say something. She immediately recognized the voice belonging to my dad's friend that passed suddenly many years ago (I've talked about him in a previous story, he was Native American, same as my dad). 

Though out that week many of us on different occasions saw a shadow figure that would peek its head around the threshold of my dad's bedroom door. It didn't have the shape of anyone any of us recognized so no one could really agree as to who or what it was. A friend of my sisters believed it was something malevolent. But I didn't and still don't think so. During this time we were able to communicate with dad through yes and no questions. We'd ask if a person that we knew who had passed was there and he nod or shake his head accordingly. We gathered through this that both my grandparents and three family friends that had passed were there, but also someone he didn't know, but said wasn't a threat. That's why I believe the figure was a guide from the other side.

 On June 24, 2022 at 10:45am my dad took his final breath. He was 70 years old. The moment he left, all the heaviness that had been there all week seemed to also leave, but the experiences stayed and took on a new feeling.

 About an hour and a half after he had passed, I was outside with my sister, our cousin and my sister's friend when we heard a car door shut. This particular door shutting can't be mistaken, it was the driver's side door to my dad's 1968 Chevy C-10 pickup truck. It had belonged to my grandfather before he passed. My dad loved this truck. It has been sitting not running for a long while. Just days before my dad died, my nephew decided to get it running again and gave it a wash. We think my dad was taking one last look.

 A few nights after, another of our friends was walking to the kitchen when he suddenly heard a voice say his name behind him.

He's not really a believer but he insists the voice he heard was dad's. On another night I was sitting on the back steps and he was standing in front of me talking when he jumps and says that he just glanced at the screen door and saw my dad's silhouette standing there.

 Fast forward a couple of months, things got bad financially and I had to move back to my parents' house. My mom doesn't sleep in the bedroom anymore so I moved into it. Same room/bed my dad passed in. On occasion when I'm trying to get to sleep I feel someone lay next to me, in the spot my dad laid. Sometimes I'll feel someone grab my big toe and yank it, something my dad used to always do. One day I went to pick up my phone and as I pulled it toward me it felt like someone tried to pull it out my hand. It didn't feel aggressive and in that instant I had a mental imagine of my dad grinning.

 It took me a few months to finally feel something after his passing. After he had passed I didn't feel. I was numb. I didn't cry or anything. Then one day it hit me full force. But it wasn't sadness that over came me, it was anger. It was hatred. I'm not a hateful person, but in that moment I hated all the doctors and nurses that had worked with my dad. I hated their ""lies"" that he would be alright. I hated them for not stopping the cancer like they'd promised. I hated God for allowing this. And as bad as it sounds, I hated my dad simply because he'd died. I wanted so bad to punch him square in the jaw. To cuss him out for not stopping smoking when he was told to stop 18 years ago. I remember looking at a picture of him and just yelling ""F you! You stupid S.O.B! F you!"" Just yelling ""F you"" over and over until finally the tears came and I cried my self to sleep. It was around 3am when I woke up to someone walking around the room. I hear the steps walk to one side and what sounded like someone going through things, then the steps would walk to the other side of the room and again things being gone through.

I had a fish tank that I kept the light on at night, so I could see I was alone. So I sit up and mutter, ""What the hell?"". Then as clear as day I hear my dads voice say, ""It's me, Bud. It's ok to be angry"" followed by something I couldn't make out.

 A few nights ago it cooled down outside to 68 degrees so I decided to go out and walk the property. I don't know why but I grabbed my Spirit Talker, those little boxes that displays a word and a computer voice says the word. As I was walking I turned it on and a short while later it started talking:

 Box: (my dads name) 

 Me: what about (dads name)?

 Box: Honest

 Me: what's he honest about?

 Box: trees

My dad was Native American. He was a story teller and one of his main talking points was about Mother Earth and how the trees play an important role in life and how we should respect them and honor nature.

 Me: where is (dads name)?

 Box: come and go

 Me: why does he come and go?

 Box: Happy

 Being a skeptical believer I take those boxes with a grain of salt, but I couldn't help but get a tad emotional.

This is the longest post I've made. I may have added things that may seem unnecessary, but I felt them necessary to put some of the things I experienced into context.

Thank you for reading."
"Esther's Boarding House","Ohio","Haunted Places","Back in 1972 about 2 weeks after I turned 18, I eloped with Bill, my first husband, to Catlettsburg, KY. My parents didn't approve of him to begin with. I have to 'agree' many years after the fact that 'they' were 'right'. I 'thought' I knew everything at that young age, but most 18-year olds 'think' they do. Until they find out, much later in life, that they didn't really know diddly-squat.

When we came back to Ohio we lived in downtown Willoughby. I wasn't but 10 minutes away from my folk's house. Bill, and I lived with his foster parents, Esther, and Dave, in her house.

 Esther's house was originally a farmhouse way back when her great grandparents first purchased it. It was, then, passed down to her parents, and from her parents to her. It was farm area until the town sprung up years later.

Esther got married young, but the marriage failed. She had no children, but since the farm was no more, she rented out rooms. It became a Boarding house to earn income. It was a rather large house. In the front were the cement steps leading up to the entrance. Once inside, you were in an alcove/small entry way. From there you passed through another door into a hallway. Directly ahead was a dining room, and off to the immediate right was the living room. Off of the dining room was the master bedroom, Esther's. From the dining room you walked into a fair-sized kitchen with a pantry to the left as you went in. From the kitchen, and around the corner to the left was the bathroom. Outside of the bathroom was a little hall. Around the opposite corner was the door that led down to the basement/root cellar.

Upstairs were 3 more bedrooms. One on each side of the hallway. The one on the left belonged to Dave, his foster dad, and the one directly opposite was a small bedroom that was now used just for storage. Our bedroom was at the end of the hallway and was the largest of the 3.

I felt, relatively comfortable in the daytime. However, nighttime was a different story. Being a newlywed, and in a strange house I just put it down to being in a new environment. 

I always try to rationalize first. However, I kept hearing something like steps, or shuffling noises in the little room that was used for storage. I kept that to myself as I didn't want Bill to think he married someone weird. I didn't want him to think I was 2 short of a six-pack.

After several months, though, it didn't abate. I kept hearing the noises. Finally, winter came and it was extremely cold up there. Esther had no A/C for the summer months making it unbearably hot and the furnace for winter was in the basement with only 2 heating ducts. One for the dining room/den and one that lead straight upstairs into the hallway that was expected to heat all 3 bedrooms. Biggest joke of the century!

I began getting a little nervous when walking by the spare room. I'd feel like a wave of cold coming off of the closed door. That room always had the door closed. I never bothered to open it to explore. At least, I didn't want to be alone and go in there. Finally, Bill began hearing things, too. At last, I wasn't bonkers because he said he'd been hearing noise also. However, he thought it was just mice since there was an occasional mouse that wandered in down in the kitchen now and then. Ha! It sounded like a 'very' big mouse to 'me'. Like a 5-to-6-foot mouse.

One night we were watching T.V. In our bedroom. We were reclining on the bed and enjoying the program. Bill had a dog, a mutt, named Sparky that was lying beside the bed. Suddenly Sparky's head shot up. His ears perked and the hackles on his back rose. He began to softly growl while staring at our bedroom door. The dog got up, strode to the door and began sniffing under the door. Like there was someone standing on the other side. We were pretty sure we were the only one's home at the time and we didn't hear Esther and Dave returning. So, Bill retrieved a hammer that he had in a toolbox on the floor of the closet and I grabbed a 12-inch-long screwdriver (Don't laugh. You can stab with one end or use the other end as a club. You have to be creative.). We went to the door. Bill whipped open the door to...nothing. All we saw was a dark hallway. 

The next day I was confiding in Bill about what I heard & felt in the spare room. He assured me that it was nothing. To prove it he went to the room with me following. He opened the door & we were greeted with a blast of ice-cold air that just came gushing out. Ice-cold air? In the summer? We went inside and there was an old box spring mattress leaning up against the wall and some boxes of odds and ends lying about the room. At the far-right end of the room was a door. I asked him where that lead to. He told me it was the attic & roof. It was a crawlspace, but you had to walk on the rafters very carefully lest you'd fall through the ceiling. He opened the door to the attic.

 I, immediately, felt and knew there was a presence in there. I began questioning him. I asked him if someone ever died in that room. His face went blank. He confirmed that an old man that was an alcoholic used to be a boarder there years ago. He was never any trouble, but suddenly 3 weeks went by and he hadn't paid his board. They hadn't seen him in that time period either. Finally, Dave entered the room. It appeared to be empty, but there was an overwhelming, rotten smell coming from the attic. When the door was opened, they found the old man inside lying motionless on the rafters. He had gotten terribly drunk and crawled inside and went to sleep. It was in the wintertime. There was absolutely no heat, but he was too drunk to feel it. He froze to death. Bill asked me 'how' I knew that something happened in that room. I told him that I just 'knew' and that the old man didn't realize he was gone and just stuck in there. 

Bill told me the old man's name was Chester. I began talking to Chester. I told him that he was gone and to go to a much better place to be with his family again. I explained to him that he wasn't there anymore & to go to his loved ones where he'd be happy. We left the room. I wasn't too sure if what I said did any good, but we'd find out the next day.

The next day we came home from shopping. I told him we should check the room now. Bill agreed. We went upstairs and entered the room. It was insufferably hot in there. We opened the door to the attic & it was like a bake oven. No A/C. Remember? The room felt like it 'should' have.

Bill asked me how I did that. I told him that I sensed that Chester was just confused. That he didn't even know what was going on. Once I explained the situation to him, he understood and moved on. I admit I was rather amazed that the explanation did it.

 The house I moved into 7 years later with my 2nd husband was not so easy to deal with. That house was farther down the road around the block. We were sent running from 'that' place. However, Chester wasn't a problem. He was just confused and needed to know what happened to him. I admit that, sometimes, it was a bit unnerving while he was there, but not a frightening experience. I was glad that he moved on to a better place and I hope he was happy with his loved ones.

 Bill did look at me rather funny after that episode. He wasn't too sure about psychic individuals. He was a skeptic, but he couldn't get around what happened to us. I'll bet he's glad to be rid of this wacky psychic woman-as he called me. I know I was glad to get rid of him, lol!"
"The Haunted Mantel Clock","Ohio","Haunted Items","This didn't happen to me, but to my late husband, John, back when he was 16 years old. In 1962 his Mother, Mary, was recently widowed for a couple years when she remarried Tom. They moved into a house in Eastlake, Ohio. Your average, normal-sized house with 3 bedrooms. Of course, Mary had a lot of personal possessions from her late husband, Chuck. One of them being a beautiful solid oak mantel clock from the Black Forest in Germany.

He treasured that clock and took immaculate care of it. Making sure to always keep it wound up to chime on the hour. When he became very ill and knew he didn't have long, he told her that after he went that he wanted her to keep that clock wound. Never let it run down because if she did, he hoped he would come back to haunt them.

Well, they set up housekeeping in their new residence. John was 16, and his sister, Beth, was 12. For a while Mary, or John would wind the clock. However, they were still arranging everything in the house as well as getting new items. Such as some new furniture. On top of that John and Beth were going to new schools, making new friends, etc., etc... 

Not quite one year into settling into the new house they neglected to wind the clock. This clock was very Bavarian in appearance with ornate scrolled wood-work all around the face with flowers & birds on either side. Under the clock face was the area where the pendulum swung back and forth. The pendulum had a maple leaf on the bottom of it. 

During one day while they having dinner and conversation the clock began chiming. It 'wasn't' wound. This perplexed them, but they just brushed it off as a fluke. However, the clock kept chiming on the hour. 

Determined to figure this mystery out John and Tom began inspecting it to see if there was something mechanical, they may have overlooked. They couldn't find any mechanical cause to account for it. However, they still did not wind it since the key got misplaced from moving in and they couldn't locate it. They still had some boxes that were packed because they had to figure out where to put certain items.

The clock remained silent the rest of the day. It began chiming around 2 in the morning much to their dismay and confusion. They stuck it in the linen closet in a box thinking that would resolve the issue. However, the clock began chiming every hour on the hour. 

Mary was beginning to get quite upset with it. She started to think it was haunted by her late husband, Chuck. He said he would haunt them if they didn't keep it wound. John poo-pooed 'that' idea. He didn't think an 'item' could be haunted. To make sure it wouldn't chime anymore he removed the pendulum and put it back in the box at the back of the linen closet. Problem solved. Or so he thought. The clock began chiming a couple hours later. They couldn't believe it. John pulled the clock out of the box in the closet only to observe that even though the pendulum was removed that the little arm that the pendulum was mounted was ticking back and forth-tick, tick, tick, tick. He showed it to everyone. 

By this time Mary was in tears. She just couldn't stand it anymore. The clock began to depress her as it reminded her of Chuck. Also, the fact that it appeared to 'really' be haunted unnerved everyone. The decision was made to sell it. Within a week, or so the clock was sold to someone and taken out of the house.

 John and Mary told me that they always wondered if the clock continued its unusual behavior after it was removed from them and the house. Or did Chuck go along with it. He, Mary, Beth and Tom did believe that the clock 'was' haunted. They didn't hear anything about it after that and didn't really want to know. Some things are better left alone in the long run."
"Get Frightened-learn A Lesson","Ohio","Ouija Board / Seances","This happened many years ago when I was a dumb kid, & messed with something I shouldn't have only to regret it later. My cousins, C., & K. (Just using the initials for privacy reasons.) lived in Cleveland. My folks would take us to visit with them quite frequently through the years when we were growing up since C. Was my age, & K. Was my sister, J's age, which was 5 years younger. So, C., & I were the 'big sisters'. We were the big girls. About 13-14 years old around this time. It was during the Fall time of the year.

We did all the stupid things that kids do before they develop something in the later years called 'common sense', lol! We told ghost stories a lot & recorded our antics on a little 3-inch reel-to-reel tape recorder that I had. We'd play ourselves back for fun. We'd go exploring, or walking to places that we thought were interesting. In other words, we had fun together.

One time, whilst visiting at their house in Cleveland, one of us-I don't remember who-had the idea to conduct a 'seance'. Since I had had some paranormal experiences when I was much younger, I was selected to conduct it. Lucky me. I didn't really give too much credence to what we were about to do at the time. I wished later that I would have. 

They lived in a relatively smallish-sized house. There was the master bedroom downstairs that my aunt, & Uncle slept in, & a spare room that they used kind of like a playroom. It was small, but big enough to accommodate a sofa, T.V. Stand, easy chair, & 2 little end-tables. My cousin's bedroom was upstairs. It was originally the attic when they bought the house, but my aunt, & Uncle labored to turn it into a lovely girl's bedroom of a very large size with a walk-in closet/cubby-hole room on one side of the hallway.

We held the seance in the back spare room. We closed the door, & just lit a small lamp to give off a soft light. Before starting we had to decide who we wanted to contact. The vote was to contact-get this-King Tut. I began it with a tongue-in-cheek attitude quite frankly. However, as it progressed, I began to take it seriously. We were all concentrating & calling on him while holding hands & staring at the lamplight. It wasn't but about 10 minutes into the session that we started to observe 'something' forming in the corner behind the easy chair that sat next to the window. It was rather short of stature, standing rather off-center, & a vaporous gas-fire blue. It looked like a short person. 

We sat speechless & transfixed just staring at it. We were squeezing each other's hands so hard I'm surprised that we didn't break each other's fingers. That's how stunned we were.

Suddenly the spell was broken when ""I"" had what felt like 2 fingers forcefully rammed into my right ribcage causing me to jump, & scream at that point. We all unclasped hands & watched as the form just evaporated from the corner of the room. One of my cousins jumped up to the light switch & turned the lights on. Our parents came to the back room, & demanded to know what us kids were up to. The usual answer from a kid was 'nothing'. We were told to keep it down.

We didn't dare tell our parents 'what' we were doing. Our parents were religious, & what we were doing was a major, big time no-no. We just all sat there looking at each other, & glancing around the room trying to evaluate just 'what' really happened to us. I was sitting on the far end sofa that had a stuffed toy kitty sitting on the armrest. So, who poked me so hard that it hurt. No one was even near me. I know what I felt. It actually hurt. Matter of fact, I had a little bruise between my ribs to prove it. I decided, then, & there, no more conducting seances. It was far too scary for my taste.

However, 'that' was not the end of it. Months later. In the good ol' Summertime, our cousins came to visit us. We went upstairs to my sister's, & my bedroom. C., & K. Wanted to have another seance'. I protested, but they 'talked' me into it. Ugh! Our bedroom was, once, the attic also, but our parents worked hard to turn it into a beautiful bedroom for us. We all sat on the floor & lit a candle. We were discussing who we wanted to contact. One of my cousins mentioned Adolph Hitler. I gave a resounding ""no way!"". I told them to contact someone nice. Not a monster like that. We decided on Abe Lincoln. He was always my favorite President, next to JFK. We held hands, once again, & concentrated. This time I asked for an audible signal like 2 knocks. Inside of a couple minutes we heard 2 loud knocks resounding from our cubby-hole crawl space that we used for storage. We 'all' heard it.

I lost my nerve at that point. I told it to go away, & I broke the circle. I told my cousins that what we were doing was not a good idea. That we shouldn't be messing with stuff like this. My cousins were intrigued, but my little sister, J., 'listened' to me. Unusual for a little sister to 'listen' to the big sister, but J. Looked up to me, & if ""I"" said it's a bad idea then it's a bad idea. However, that was not quite the end of it that night. Unbeknownst to me, the worst was yet to come. 

After they went home, we went to bed for the night. Nothing strange there. J., & I had twin beds. One on each side of the room across from each other. Next to our beds & built into the walls were shadow boxes that we kept little knickknacks, some ceramic animals, books, & we each had a little doll sitting in the cases. About 2 in the morning, I heard what I, first, thought was my Dad tromping up the steps to our room. He would, sometimes, come up to check on us. As parents often do. Only 'this' time he didn't turn on the hallway light coming up the steps. He would bring his flashlight with him to shine just far enough to make sure we were in bed, & alright. This time there was no hall light, or a flashlight. I thought that to be very strange for him. I was laying on my stomach, pretending to be asleep when I got the feeling that it wasn't my Dad coming to look in on us after all. I, then, heard very heavy footsteps on the tile floor coming towards us. My Dad was always barefooted when he did his checks. This whatever it was had heavy-soled shoes on.

I, suddenly, felt enveloped in an intense cold. To the point of shivering. Weird! It was Summer. That upstairs bedroom was ridiculously hot that time of year, & in 1968 my Dad couldn't afford A/C at the time. So, we just slept with the windows open for air. I laid there motionless, & barely breathing with my eyes closed tight. I felt a definite weight leaning over me & heard the items in my shadowbox being moved around. After that I heard 'it' go over to my sister's bed & do the same thing. I was freaking. I, then, heard it turn, & walk away back down the steps. I must've passed out after all this was over.

In the morning, my sister began accusing me of knocking all the stuff over in her shadowbox. However, everything was knocked over in my shadowbox as well. I told her exactly what happened during the night. Her face went blank. We were very frightened. We vowed to never conduct a seance' again.

A couple of weeks later I confessed to my Mom what we had done. As expected, she read me the riot act. My Mom is deeply religious & told me that only God has the power to do those things! I felt quite upset, & ashamed. I would never do something disrespectful like that. At that time in my life, I didn't even give a thought to what we did. To us dumb kids, we thought it was cool, but cool soon turned on us, & brought us to our senses the hard way.

I guess that some of the best lessons learned are those that we learn the hard way. I've, since that time, have never again experimented with conducting, or participating in seances. I realized that you cannot command the spirits to perform for our amusement. If anything, you respect them. I've had visitations from my late husband, but I never tried to contact him. He came to 'me' as an assurance that 'he' is alright & loves me. He has visited me in special circumstances when I was extremely stressed, & trepidatious to give me comfort. I believe that our loved ones do that to comfort & encourage us. That's fine with me, but I, no longer try to contact the other side. I know better. I learned my lesson. If you don't know what you're doing, just don't do it. You'll be better off in the long run. I hope these are words of wisdom!"
"The Door Bell","Missouri","Haunted Places","I have three dogs. Skye, River, and Lavender. Skye went to heaven several years ago. So it is my daughter, River, Lavender and I in this house. At the end of 2018, my daughter and I moved to a small town. We live a couple blocks away from my middle sister. River is a Husky and has a deep bark. Lavender in the other hand is a long haired chihuahua and has a high pitch bark. They typically bark when there is a knock, doorbell ring, car door shuts, or when someone is running outside.

One day, I was laying in my bedroom. I heard the doorbell ring and River started barking. I walked to the front of the house and no one was there. I walked to the back of the house, and no one was there. I shrugged and thought nothing more of it. Another time, I was laying on the couch. I heard the doorbell ring and again River and Lavender started barking. I checked the front door and back door, but nothing. My daughter has also heard the doorbell ring and when she checks, we have the same out come. This door bell ringing has happened numerous times, and same outcome. All we hear is our dogs barking. This has happened for a year now. 

My questions are: 

How are we hearing a door bell? It's been out of service for sometime now. The back doorbell has been out of service since we moved in. The front doorbell has been out service for about a year now. The doorbell does not contain batteries. It's a wired doorbell. 

Who could it be? Could it be the previous owners of this house? When I looked up the lady that previously owned this house, I was directed to an obituary that read, ""... Passed away peacefully on Wednesday, July 13, 2016, at her home""."
"My Friend's House","Utah","Haunted Places","A couple of years ago a coworker/friend was stressing out. Her husband and son wanted to go on a hunting/camping trip and she had no one to watch her cat. I told her I love kitties and I would be very happy to watch the kitty! The night before she left I went to her house to see where the cat food was and what she needed done while she was gone. I had never been to her house before. She kind of showed me around, and they were getting ready to sell the house. She and her husband wanted something that was ""theirs"" as this house had been the divorce house of one of them. I met the kitty, her name was Sophie, and as a normal cat I gushed over how wonderful and pretty she was, and she ignored me with disgust. 

While we were there visiting for a moment she went to get her husband. There were 2 rooms upstairs and I thought he was in the first one that was like a kid's room. The room wasn't being used as most of the kids had moved out. The only kid at home was her son, and he was in the basement. The room upstairs that wasn't the master (kid's room) was being used as kind of a storage room. There were a few boxes and some odds and ends waiting to be packed. I was confused my friend went to get her husband outside as I was so sure he was in that bedroom upstairs, but suddenly he appeared from outside. I kept looking at the doorway waiting for someone to come out even though we had been through that area of the house and I knew where everyone was.

The first day I went to go take care of Sophie, my husband went with me. I went in the house and it felt very cold but there was something else too. It was that room again. I went spoke very loudly to Sophie. I asked her where she was and then went downstairs to get her food containers and bring them upstairs to fill. I saw Sophie sitting back in a corner of the basement in an area that would be hard for me to get to. I filled her food and talked to myself. My husband had stayed outside and I wished he had not. It felt like someone was in that bedroom again. I wanted to go get him because my immediate and first response was fear related. I could even see movement and hear something low. There was a cat toy right outside the door like someone had been playing with the cat. I didn't let it know that I knew it was there. I filled Sophie's food and water, talked to her, sang a song, and got out of there fast because it still bothered me that I knew something was there. I ran out to my husband's car and we left. The next time I went to take care of Sophie I asked my husband to go in with me. I told him something was in there.

We went in the house, I didn't find Sophie this time, but she had been eating the food. The cat toy was gone, the presence was still there but felt farther from me in terms of not being as close as last time. I thought it might be because my husband was there. He knows that when I say something is there, we don't ""talk"" about it unless I say we can. I usually don't want whatever is there to know that I know it is there because that opens a whole can of stuff sometimes. We took care of Sophie. My husband did walk upstairs and then came back down showing me with his face that he saw nothing out of the ordinary. He doesn't see, hear, or feel things like myself and my youngest daughter do. 

When I got home, I messaged my friend and finally I told her that she might think I am crazy but who the heck is in that bedroom. She was quiet for a minute and I was like, ""oh no I have weirded her out."" Then she said, ""what do you mean? That room kind of bothers me. Denny's (the husband) daughters had that room and I always worried what they were doing."" I told her that I could sense something but that I wasn't sure what or who it was and I'd try to figure it out next time. 

The last and final time I went to go take care of Sophie, I tried to take Jacey with me. I have stories on here about Jacey and some of the things we have experienced. She seems to have a different sense than I do. Mine is usually auditory and if I concentrate I can get information. Jacey will see them. She says she can talk to them but she chooses not to. She saw some in high school and told me about how she did a really good job not letting them know she could see them. Them being the ghost or whatever they are. I think they are ghosts. Well, Jacey was having an emo teenager day, so she was not willing to go. My husband went. He took care of kitty. I sat on the steps going up the stairs and concentrated on the energy. Many times this let's them know that I know they are there. It was a male energy. Related to her husband. Felt like he might have a moustache. I protected myself and then told him, I know you are here, is there anything you want to tell me. What I found was that he seemed to feel sorry he had scared me. He did not wish to talk. There were some boots he liked. He was just passing through. Then the energy faded pretty completely. 

I contacted my friend. It turned out her husband's father had passed about 6 months or so ago. I am not sure about the boots as she said they were her grandfather's. She worried there was something evil in the room. I told her that was not the case. I also told her that it was just ""passing through"" as that was what the energy seemed to say before fading away. She sold the house shortly after that. She told me that she really hoped the spirit was her grandfather, but I told her he is connected to your husband. Not sure if they might have had something of his dad's in the house. 

However, I think she attracts her old family members. She moved into a brand new build and there's a female spirit there. This spirit will not talk to me. It doesn't really even want me to know it is there and will often leave. It is connected to my friend. It leaves a cold spot in the hallway. I have spent over a year trying to figure out who the spirit is, but so far no luck. She showed herself to me in terms that she let me feel that she was there, but I can't even get an image of her. I only know female and can't even figure out an age which I usually can. I have never met a spirit as closed as that one. I need to take Jacey sometime. Either way, I thought this story was sweet and kind of heartwarming instead of spooky and hope you enjoyed it. If there are ideas how I might respectfully figure out who is in the hall let me know. Otherwise, I just leave that spirit be. It has always been quiet and kind to me, and doesn't bother anyone. I really only want to figure out who it is so I can tell my friend. So far, it feels like it is either a grandparent, aunt or possibly a child she miscarried, but I cannot say for sure."
"Grandma Came To Visit Me","Utah","Family / Friends Visits","Grandma came to visit me one last time. This story is very personal for me. It occurred a little over a year today but I still remember it so clearly. I feel as if I took a little paranormal break for a little while. I worked through some personal things. Some job things that led to depression. Then pulled myself back out, dusted myself off, had a few bouts of being sucked back in and came back out on the other side again... But back to what happened a year ago. I can even tell you the date: July 6, 2022. Grandma had not been well. She was my last living grandma. You're probably not supposed to have a favorite, but she was a favorite. She always acted like whatever I did was great. She never told me I wasn't enough or doing enough. She accepted everything and everyone. 

She ended up in the hospital. I think her mind was going in some ways and she wasn't taking her medication. She had become a stubborn older lady at 94 years. Why did she stop taking her medication? I wish I knew if she forgot or just didn't feel like it. Both are possible. My mom and one of my uncles lived close to Grandma and she enjoyed her freedom in her little apartment. Grandma and I did not even live in the same state. She was in Montana which was my home for many years and I was in Utah. 

From the hospital she was moved to this rehab facility and had been there for a couple good weeks. It was apparent to me and other cousins that grandma might not make it out of there back to her cute little apartment. My mom held out hope. She kept telling me that, ""mom might have to stay there a little longer than planned, but I think she will be back."" Then before grandma passed, they cleaned out her apartment. And grandma peacefully left this earth. I knew the day it happened and even the time. Physically I was asleep in bed, but it's like I went somewhere. 

Everything is so sharp. It felt almost like Christmas but it wasn't. I was at what used to be grandma's house. My grandma and grandpa used to live in the ranch house before it was given to one of ""the boys."" That side of the family had a very large cattle ranch, but that's a different story - not paranormal. Everyone else in the family was in the background. They were talking. They were sitting in the living room, visiting and everyone was having a good time. I was standing and suddenly grandma was there. She was in one of her favorite red sweaters. She loved red sweaters. She told me it was time to go. She talked only to me and no one else in the family engaged with us the whole time. She looked the way she looked when I was a younger; kid or a teen. I asked her go where but the pit in my stomach knew. She said it was ""time to go"" again. She gave me a hug and a kiss. I followed her to the door and asked where she was going. She said she needed to go now. She stopped at the door and I knew I was unable to go farther. The interesting part is this part of the ranch house, my uncle had added on to. I marveled at how that addition was gone. This was grandma's house again. Grandma opened the door and looked at me one last time. It was dark outside. It would have been dark this time in the physical world as well. She walked out the door and there were 3 people outside. I noticed grandma's garden was lush again. The way it had been when she was alive and before my aunt ripped up all the plants grandma had loved and cared for. She never looked back. She walked outside to those 3 people and her arms raised up to hug. The middle one was her mom. Don't ask how I know, I just know. Although I may have met my great-grandma once I don't remember her, and I have just a few memories of meeting this lady in a nursing home before she passed on. My mom said I was maybe 3 at the time.

I woke up. I gasped, looked at the clock. It was a little after 4. I put my head back down and told myself to get some sleep, but felt the pit in my stomach. Amazingly I went back to sleep. I woke up around 6:30. Looked at my phone. Saw there was a voicemail. It was from my mom. I knew. I just new. Her voicemail was amazingly calm, not full of emotion and just said to give her a call. I called her and she said, ""grandma passed."" I didn't know what to say except, ""I'm sorry. I know."" She said not to be sorry. It was very peaceful. She told me story of my uncle calling her around 2 am and the nurses had been in. They weren't sure she'd make it through the night. My mom asked if she needed to come in and he didn't know, but said things were okay. My mom got up, made coffee. Drank some and woke up my dad and told him she was going in. She went in and she and my uncle talked quietly and laughed while talking about memories, and she sat and rubbed one of grandma's legs as she seemed to be asleep in bed. Then at one point, she said she told my uncle, ""I don't think mom is breathing anymore."" He came over, agreed, they called a nurse and grandma had passed. It was a little after 4. I told her my story as best as I could without breaking down bawling. I did not share it with other family. However, my mom did and that's okay.

 There is a short part 2 to this I will have to write later, and a couple other stories not related to this I need to write down another time. She hasn't been back to visit me yet. I keep hoping she will at some point. It's been little over a year, but maybe she's busy. I am still not sure who the other 2 ladies with her mom were. It was too dark to see them and I probably wouldn't recognize them. I am curious though, and I hope grandma is doing well where ever she went."
"Quaint Wasn't So Quaint","Colorado","Haunted Places","Many years ago, my husband and I moved to southern Colorado for his job. We settled into this quaint little two-bedroom apartment in a 75-year-old house in an old mining town. At first everything seemed so nice. It was small but quaint, lots of windows, a nice little fenced in yard for our dogs to play and hang out. We had a nice view of the town and the surrounding mountains. I busied myself with unpacking and setting up our humble abode while my husband went to work each day, often coming home late due to a very busy schedule.

I became acquainted with the neighbors and a few towns folk that I had met while shopping at the local stores. I started to learn about the history of this old mining town. The town had a colorful history, cowboy life, saloon girls, a lot of violence and death and a darkness loomed over this small town. As life slowed down for me a bit, I turned myself to learning more about this ""quaint"" little town.

I often strolled the streets to hunt for antiques or unique gifts to send home to family. While our little town wasn't a huge tourist mecca, it still catered to the ""just passing through"" crowd that stopped off the highway for dining and fuel. During my jaunts around town I began to notice that most of the churches were closed up or for sale. There were a lot of boarded up businesses and just as many bars to drown one's sorrows in. My rose-colored glasses had slowly started to slide down my nose and I began to see and feel what was not so ""quaint"" about this town.

My whole life, I have also had the curse of being able to ""feel"" and ""see"" what I didn't want to. Being empathic is not a gift and I work hard to keep it turned off as much as possible, especially when it comes to the spirit world. It served me well when I was a pagan but as a Christian, it is not welcome. This town came alive to me in a way I didn't want it to. I went from being enchanted and interested to counting the days until we could leave. 

On a very cold but sunny day in January, I happen to be heading to my favorite antique store to break up the monotony of my day. Just ahead of me, was a person walking in the same direction. Dark knee length coat with the collar turned up, dark pants and shoes. I couldn't make out if it was a woman or man but at the time it didn't matter. This lone figure turned into the store I was headed to. I was a little excited because it would give me a opportunity to talk to a new person to gleam more history. Less than a minute later, I entered the antique store. I was greeted by the owner, Mandie. I greeted her back and looked around the shop, which wasn't very big and only had one other side room that you could see into from the front entrance. She asked me who I was looking for and I said the person in the black coat that just came in before me. Her face went a little white, she gave me an uncomfortable smile and said that there had not been anyone else in the shop until just now, when I walked in. We stood there staring at each other and she said quietly, ""you will see a lot of that around here"", and walked into the other room. I know what I saw, clear as the website I am typing this story on. We never spoke of it again. 

I dismissed the incident and forgot to mention it to my husband until a few nights later. We were relaxing in our tiny living room watching TV with the dogs when there was an overwhelming smell of freshly brewed coffee coming through the doorway of the kitchen. We are both coffee drinkers but not at night. As I sniffed the air, my husband asked me what was wrong. I asked him if he could smell the coffee and he couldn't. He was sitting less than 10 feet from me; he shook his head and suggested that maybe it was the downstairs neighbor. There were two apartments below us, one was unoccupied and the other had a young fellow living there who attended a small college nearby. I reminded my husband that there was no interlocking venting system in this old house, we had base-board heat and no AC. But as we discussed it, the smell went away. I don't know why we dismissed it so easily at that point, the dogs showed no reaction and we went back to our program.

Incidents like the coffee and stranger that disappears were becoming frequent occurrences. Often times, there would be the strong smell of a freshly lit cigarette right next to me on the couch. Or I would hear movement in the bedroom just down a short hall from the living room but the dogs were with me in the kitchen. I walk in the direction of the bedroom but it was empty and the dogs would look at me with curiosity but would not enter the room until I did. It was these little, seemingly innocuous occurrences that never unnerved me enough to want to bolt out of the apartment. They didn't happen to my husband and dogs never responded with any warning or aggression. I had had the opportunity to chat with the neighbor downstairs one day and then things got really interesting and terrifying!

We had to access the basement through the downstairs apartment. The young man, Ken, showed us through his spacious apartment to the basement trapdoor on his screened in locked porch. We chatted about his course work as we walked down the stairs into stone basement and then I realized he wasn't with me and my husband anymore. I turned around as I reached the bottom step and noticed he stayed upstairs looking down at me with a fearful look in his eyes. My husband and the landlord walked deeper into the basement and were busy talking about the underground sprinklers for the yard and didn't notice that Ken and I were not with them. Suddenly I felt like I was caught, quite literally, in the middle of the three men and I couldn't move. I couldn't breathe either! My chest felt heavy, my breath was shallow, and I couldn't fill my lungs enough to ask for help. I looked at Ken and he came down a few steps and reached his hand out to me. Somehow, I managed to raise my arm up and take his hand, he pulled me up the stairs and out of my ""prison"". He guided me into his kitchen and gave me a glass of water. When the feeling of impending doom passed, we spoke about the incidences he had experienced. Missing keys, banging in the back bedroom, lights not working, things being moved or disappearing around his apartment. The basement was totally off limits to him, he stated. ""You couldn't pay me enough to go into that place"". He said the back bedroom always had this oppressive feel to him and that the place scared his girlfriend so much that she would not return there to visit him. As we chatted in the kitchen, I noticed that Ken did not own a coffee pot, nor did he drink coffee as he stated when I asked about it. My husband and the landlord finished their business in the basement and joined us in the kitchen. Neither of them noticed what had happened to me. Over dinner that evening I told my husband what had happened, he looked concerned, but I felt that he didn't quite believe me. Keep in mind, he had experienced nothing other than smelling perfume that didn't smell like mine and just dismissed it. 

Days turned into weeks, and I waited for the other shoe to drop. I knew an ambush was coming because all had been quiet. No strange noises, no unexplained smells, no disappearing strangers. One day I noticed that Ken had left. I never saw any activity that suggested he was moving, no trucks, no boxes, no sounds of people moving furniture. I inquired with the landlord, and he told me Ken had decided to move home and had left within a couple of days of his announcement to our landlord. Now the whole house was vacant except for us. I felt so alone and isolated. My husband was working longer hours and had some work travel. I had the dogs for company and comfort. 

My bedtime routine is pretty simple, let the dogs out, brush my teeth and wash my face, let the dogs in, make sure all doors are locked, check the security system and head off to bed. But many nights I always felt like somebody was watching me while I went about my routine. The pantry did not have a door on it and you had to pass by it moving from the kitchen to the living room. I always felt like someone was tucked away in the back of it, hidden in the shadow. The small hallway also left me with that feeling as well, somebody was standing in that hallway watching. And THAT... Was a feeling I always had with that hallway. I always read before I go to sleep. As I lay propped up in bed, the dogs curled up in their beds, my eyes were always drawn to the bedroom door. To the hallway. I would leave lights on from the small lamp in the kitchen through the living room and the small night light in the bathroom. It drove my husband crazy because ""electricity is not free"". At least he never accused me of being crazy or over-reacting. Sometimes I doubted my sanity after being in that apartment.

One night, the feeling was overwhelming! I tried to ignore it. I spoke to it, the first time ever. I said, ""you are not welcome here. I want you to leave!"" I spoke this as I walked to the bedroom door and closed it in ""its"" face. I called the dogs up on the bed, said a prayer and the door opened. The feeling I picked up was anger, intense burning anger and it was the first time I had felt such a level of fear since we had moved in. I prayed again, harder and invoked the name of Jesus over the house and all present. Suddenly, my fear was gone and the energy went from very heavy to just a normal level. But the dogs were focused on the bedroom doorway. They were in guard mode and were not going to relax. I fought sleep but eventually it won and the next thing I knew, the sun was streaming through the window. One thing about that place, mornings were always so lovely. Bright, airy, comfortable and I felt safe. 

My husband had been gone for a few days and upon his return, he got an earful! I told him it was time to look for another place. I didn't care what it cost but I could not and would not stay in that place any longer. We started to argue about moving and money and he became so angry and the look in his eyes was not like anything I had seen before and the feeling that emanated from him was dark. I felt like I wasn't talking to my husband, my love and protector but a stranger! I backed out of it and said he was right. Yes, let's stay, I proclaimed; I'm just being a silly woman. I kissed him on the cheek and said, ""I'll get dinner started"". At that time, I didn't realize that that was the appetizer to the real entrée that would be served later that night.

After dinner, we quietly sat and watched some TV and then readied for bed. I went through my normal routine and by the time I finished, my husband was already tucked away in bed. I climbed in next to him, the dogs curled up in their beds and we said good night. I read for a bit but sleep crept up on me pretty fast and soon I had turned out the light and rolled over to snuggle up to my husband. I didn't feel that dark mood from him, it was his usual warm, cuddly bear self again. This is where the night turned...

I cannot clearly state if I was dreaming, in a waking dream or fully awake until I had the full realization of being awake. I hope this makes sense to you because it does not make sense to me. It was like being on two different plains of existence. In my dream state, a dark mass was swirling above the bed. But I could also see to the left and right of me and the floor as well. The mass was focused on me. I noted that any ambient light from the street through the windows were present but were blocked out by the darkest darkness I had ever seen. I saw no face on this mass, no outline of a body... It was a black mass! It moved in closer to me and I could feel it looking into me, pulling at me and pushing on me at the same time, like it was trying to turn me inside out. That was when I felt the pressure on my chest and stomach, I couldn't breathe, I couldn't swallow, the pain in my chest was excruciating and for a brief moment I thought I was having a heart attack. As I stated before, ""in my dream"" but at this point, I was not dreaming. I was fully awake and engaged with this entity. I tried to scream! In my mind, I had to push fear away and call out to Jesus. I prayed the blood of Jesus over me, I spoke to this thing with my mind and rebuked it. I called out, ""in the name of Jesus, you are not welcome here. This house belongs to God!"" And then my voice finally came...""In the name of Jesus, Satan get thee behind me! I rebuke you in the name of Jesus, I am a child of God! Leave this house NOW!"" As I yelled that at top of my lungs, my husband sprang from the bed, grabbed a gun and the dogs were at his side ready to kill. When he realized nobody was there but us and I was sobbing in the bed, he came and wrapped his arms around me. I told him everything from the time of our argument, which he did not recall at all to this immense oppression. I begged him to please find us a new place to live. 

Shortly after this latest incident, I had to go on a trip for a new job. When I returned a month later, he had found us a new place and had moved us in. 

I have had many paranormal experiences in my life. I am 67 years old and I take it all very seriously. The spirit world is not something to play with. It is a dangerous place, especially for those unprotected and lack knowledge. I have had attachments, as have some of my family members. I lived in a dark world for almost two decades before I gave my life to Jesus. If you are not a believer, that is your business and I do not judge you and I expect the same kindness. Thank you. 

Thank you for reading my story, I do apologize for the length. 

NOTE: I have changed names to protect the kind and innocent, I have excluded names to protect my privacy."
"Grandma's Creepy Closet","California","Haunted Places","Growing up, my Grandma lived in the apartment upstairs in the same complex where my family and I lived.

It was an old building with only twelve apartments in total.

She resided in apartment 2874, while we lived in 2868.

Since before I was born, Grandma had been living alone.

However, she had this closet in her hallway leading to her bedroom that seemed to have a strange occurrence every month.

Once a month, Grandma would ask my mom to come upstairs and help her check her closet.

She claimed that the night before, she would hear a lot of noise coming from her closet.

However, one day my mom was busy and asked me to go in her place.

Little did I know, this would be the start of a series of strange and unsettling experiences.

As I entered Grandma's apartment and made my way to her closet, I was taken aback by the sight before me.

It looked as if someone had ransacked the whole closet.

Her clothes were all upside down, boxes were open, and their contents were scattered across the floor.

It was as if a tornado had swept through Grandma's closet but left the rest of the apartment untouched.

I asked Grandma if this happened every month, and she confirmed that it had been occurring for the past twenty years.

At the time, I didn't pay much attention to it and simply tidied up the closet before continuing with the day.

However, around two years later, my mom suddenly passed away.

In an effort to save money and have some support, Grandma decided to move in with my dad and me.

We were in the process of moving when my dad asked me to retrieve some papers he had upstairs in Grandma's bedroom.

Reluctantly, I made my way to her apartment, feeling a sense of unease in the air.

When I walked past the closet, I could hear loud banging noises as if someone was desperately trying to break out from the inside.

Trying not to think too much about it, I brushed it off and continued towards the bedroom.

However, as soon as I stepped inside, the bedroom door slammed shut, trapping me inside.

Panic set in as I struggled to open the door, only to find that it was being held shut from the other side.

Luckily, I managed to force the door open, and I ran out of the apartment as fast as I could.

As I fled past the closet, I noticed that the banging had intensified and the whole structure was shaking violently, as though it was on the brink of exploding.

Completely terrified, I made it back to my own room, tossing the keys to Grandma's apartment to my dad, and exclaimed, ""Forget that! You go get it!"" The strange occurrences in Grandma's closet had escalated to a point where I didn't want any part in it.

From that day forward, we never mentioned the incident again, and my dad took on the task of retrieving any belongings from Grandma's apartment.

We moved on with our lives, trying to forget about the unsettling experiences we encountered.

To this day, I still wonder what caused those disturbances in Grandma's closet and if there was something more sinister at play."
"T-hill Light","Wyoming","Haunted Places","This story took place in Thermopolis, Wyoming. At the beginning of June '23, my girlfriend and I were staying there on a week-long vacation. One night after dinner, we went on a walk by the river in Hot Springs State Park. Across the river and up the bank, a road goes past T-Hill. It is named for the letter T made of white rock on its side to represent Thermopolis. 

The year previous, I hiked up this hill. A small portion of the trail is visible from the road, and you can see bits and pieces of it continuing upward if you look close. I'm very familiar with it as it took me an hour or so to reach the top. And I have visited Thermopolis and the park many times. 

Back to the night we decided to walk. The sun had just set. Some rain was falling, and a storm had passed through an hour or so beforehand. As we admired the river, I noticed a bright white-blue light on T-Hill. This light was on the established trail, moving up. 

I pointed this light out to my girlfriend. I said it was not a flashlight, as the light was not a beam- more like a ball. We both wondered if someone were going on a night hike up a steep, demanding trail in the rain but decided this probably wasn't the case. And the light was moving at a much faster pace than a person walking. 

She suggested a person biking up the hill. That was the only logical explanation as far as I could tell, so we stood there and waited to see this person either go around the switchback to continue up the hill or turn back to come down. 

Neither of those things happened. The light disappeared. We had a perfect view of the side of the hill and I know exactly where the first switchback is that should have taken a person the other direction up the hill. It did not move up or down the hill. It was just gone. We continued to walk and watch. It did not reappear. 

We went back to our truck and parked it in a lot with a higher vantage point to look for it. The strange light did not reappear, and we waited for 20 or so minutes. After a short drive back to my mom's house where we were staying, we told her about what we had seen. She did not seem surprised and told me that locals and tourists both report strange lights in the hills and mountains visible outside town and within the park. She also told me that someone had died on that trail years ago. 

Wyoming at night has an unsettling vibe I can feel in the pit of my stomach every time I'm out there. It is mostly still a very wild place. The state has the smallest population of the contiguous US. I believe lots of paranormal things do occur out there. The area and surrounding states are notorious for this weird activity. I don't have a solid idea of what I saw that night. Maybe a ghost or some kind of extraterrestrial. Or there's a normal explanation - ball lightning, or some other obscure scientific phenomenon. But no matter what it was, Wyoming has a place in my heart as a beautiful, somewhat spooky state that I will keep exploring."
"A Haunted Afternoon","Kansas","Haunted Places","This happened about three years ago at my parent's rented home; an older one story with a basement that sits on the edge of a small town.

 There's not much to the main floor- two bedrooms, a bathroom, a living room, the kitchen, and a utility room in the back.

 The basement consists of an entertainment room (tv, recliners, and shelves of books), an extra bedroom, another bathroom, and a place for the washer and dryer.

 I've been in that house alone many days and nights and even though there were times when I felt watched or like someone or something was hiding just around the corner, most of the time things were absolutely normal.

 One afternoon I was there waiting for a package that I needed to sign for. It was just me and the old family dog that was almost completely blind and close to deaf.

 I decided to nap on the couch near the front door so I wouldn't miss the UPS guy knocking.

 Just before falling asleep, I heard a loud BAM...BABAM...BABAM coming from the basement. It sounded like someone had put a brick in the dryer and turned it on.

 I quickly sat up and noticed that the dog was hearing it as well. He got off the floor, went through the kitchen and stood looking down the stairs.

 By the time I got there the noise had stopped so I looked down into the darkness below.

 Suddenly I heard a voice from down there. It sounded like a person trying to impersonate a robot. 

 ""Hello"" was all it said.

 Mom and dad don't have many weapons in the house so I grabbed a broomstick, clicked the light on and descended the stairs.

 The dryer was empty and off. I checked the entire basement but nothing was amiss.

 As I went back up the stairs I suddenly heard classical music playing from somewhere in the living room.

 When I got to the main floor it stopped.

 The only thing that would play music in the entire house would be the TV, but it had been off the whole time.

 I spent the rest of the afternoon on the couch holding the dog. Eventually the UPS guy came and things went back to normal.

 While I've never heard the dryer sound again, I have heard the music a few times, always when I'm downstairs.

 No one else has had these experiences."
"High Vibration Spiritual Energy Portal","Tennessee","Haunted Places","This is something I'm still trying to make sense of and like a huge jigsaw puzzle, I continue to get more and more pieces to help me form a bigger picture.

To give some background it involves an abandoned building near the small town I live near. The building is part of a sprawling complex that covers the area of at least a couple of football fields on both sides of the road. I became aware of the place when I started taking weekend walks down through the area a couple years ago when they opened the road back up. It was part of a huge mill and in it's heyday employed a lot of people. It had been one of the largest employers in the immediate area. Most of it contained a few offices and many open metal sheds, all of which were used to treat and process lumber in various capacities. It was in operation before my time here and now is mostly closed down. Some of if it still used as a lumber mill, and trucks still deliver wood to be processed, mostly chipped. The majority of it seems abandoned and used for storage. It looks like only a handful of people work there, mostly during the week, which is why when it's mostly abandoned on the weekends, makes for a great place to walk.

The building in question is actually on the outskirts of this place and is different in construction, it's made of brick and concrete, unlike the other buildings (save for the offices) I walked by it everyday and was fascinated with it (abandoned buildings and the history they contain has always been an interest of mine). A sort of porch or deck leads up to the main doors and there is a huge loading bay on the side towards the back. One of the doors off the side of the deck has always hung open.

How this started was on one of my walks on Easter Sunday. It was sunny and warm and I was walking by this building but this time was different. The main door at the end of the deck was wide open. I had never seen this before and before I knew it, it seemed like something compelled me to approach the building. This was out of character for me as I would think something like this through, but found myself walking the path to the deck. Though I was worried about the structural integrity of the building, my safety, trespassing, and the possibility that animals could be inside, I felt this overwhelming sense of safety, that I was protected and watched over, I cannot explain it, it was a strong feeling. To be clear, the building was by the road, no fence surrounding it and there was not a single 'no trespassing' sign or 'private property' sign or even 'keep off' sign anywhere. 

As I mounted the stairs leading onto the deck, I found them surprisingly strong, as was the deck, sturdy, considering the place had been out of commission for at least 2 decades. I glanced into the side door which was an empty space but whatever was drawing me, moved me towards the open front door. It was like being in a dream and I couldn't believe this was happening. The doors were strange, they were like the doors you see on walk in refrigerators in a kitchen. The huge steel door hung wide open and I stepped inside. The inside felt different, as if it existed outside time and space, like it's own pocket of existence, it's hard to explain. Fuse boxes were piled on the floor to my right and nearby was an old desk. One of the legs had given out and there were fuses on the desk and laying in an open drawer. A glider rocker had been set up as the chair for this desk and there were a lot of fuse boxes mounted on the walls. Whatever this place had been, it used a lot of power. Sunlight poured into the room from the open door behind me and a window to the side. There were holes in the roof which allowed more sunlight to filter down through. Despite it's age, it was fairly clean inside and even the gloomiest of corners was well lit. The place had this welcome feeling to it. As I moved towards the open loading bay, I saw a boiler on stilts and some sort of huge vat or something towards the back. There was another door, near the loading bay, a small door, that was also wide open. As weird as it sounds it was like I was being guided through the place from one door to the next? This led out to the driveway and around to the road. It was so strange, I came out of that place feeling more alive than I had in a while, I had more energy and felt like I was recharged! 

A few weeks later as spring really set in, the building became overgrown in a sense. Nature moved in to obscure the front and the deck, but not before I noticed the huge front door was closed once more, even though I left it as I had found it. I had peeked in the back door before firmly closing that as well. The doors did not lock and the back one didn't firmly latch but closed well enough. Soon after I got this weird urge to empty the memory on my camera and replace the batteries and then the next day to take it with me on my walk. 

On my walk I took plenty of pictures and noted that as I got near the building I had already drained half of the new batteries' life already. I've had this camera for some time and it's been accurate at reporting the battery capacity. I had intended to get some photos of the outside of the building, especially since the ivy growing up the building's front had sprouted several flowers. I had seen deer near the building and an abundance of wildlife including a fox. However I didn't think I had enough battery power to get the images I wanted, but tried anyways. As I went around the side filming some video and taking pictures I noticed the back door was wide open again! I had closed it and knew I had! Once again, I was compelled to enter the building and before I knew what I was doing I prepped the camera to record live video as well as to use the different settings to get photos. I thought I might need low light settings due to the darker interior. What really blew my mind was that the batteries were showing a higher charge than before. I had checked them several times and they showed at half power, now they showed 3/4 full again! That should have been impossible, they're not rechargeable, but nonetheless they had been boosted somehow! Not only that but the camera captured perfect images without using low light settings! I started filming and taking pictures of wherever I was being drawn to, it felt effortless and like I was being guided! Again like a dream, I was in control, but something was guiding me, some presence I felt but could not explain! I went out on the deck and though the place was surrounded in greenery, and obscured in view from the road, the growth had not invaded the deck or building, it was as if it was embracing the building but not reclaiming it, as is what typically happens with abandoned buildings!

Again I felt energized, and not alone, although I didn't see anything, it was what I felt. I spent a lot of time using video and the camera to get so much footage and photos, I was there for a long time. The batteries lasted amazingly enough until I reached the edge of the facility and took the final pics before the low battery indicator finally came on and the camera shut down on it's own! What's more, even though I didn't take my watch with me, when I got back home, I had only been gone less than an hour and a half? I knew I was there way longer than that! I've lost track of time before having fun, but I always end up spending way more time than I think, not less?

I have to replace the batteries and with my sometimes hectic schedule I haven't had the time yet to review the photos/video I took to see if anything shows up on them, but if I do, I will find a way to share them. Talking with a friend recently, she informed me that that the building is a portal. Apparently a really good one. The interior showed no signs of graffiti or forced entry or defacing or damaging of the property, despite the fact it's wide open. Unlike the places we hear about with negative portals and energy, where cameras are drained, people come away in bad moods and low energy, and there are no animals within a hundred miles and the place is overgrown and undermined with weeds, this place is the polar opposite, in every way! I had felt the negative side of such a place when I relayed what had happened on my family's property in another story.

Something seemed to want me to take those photos and see the building, to what purpose I don't know, but it was an amazing experience. Perhaps the doors could be explained, but they're not the easiest to open, especially the front door, because I tested it. The place had a really high and friendly spiritual energy to it. I didn't see anything outright, but I felt it and if you've read my other stories, you know I'm sensitive to other presences. Take with it what you will, it was my experience and a positive one, so I thought I would share it!"
"Ironing Board & Drowning","Illinois","Haunted Places","I'm going to tell of two separate recent incidents that I don't believe to be related.

The first is the case of the disappearing ironing board. 

The board itself is rather unremarkable; an old table top version, roughly 3 feet long and 1.5 feet wide, constructed of metal. I've had it roughly 18 years, and it was old when I got it. It generally sits against the wall of the hall closet directly below the shelf holding it's partner, the iron. 

I was prepping to do a book signing, and decided that I should press the shirt I was going to wear. I was already nervous, what with having to interact with bunch of strangers, while on the flip side worried that no one would show. And you just KNOW you will be being judged by how you look; so wrinkles are a definite no-no. I go to get out the board, only it's no where to be seen. I moved things, looking behind and under. It simply was not there. 

Thankfully, I grew up old school and ironed the shirt on the kitchen table. Seriously, I was such a nervous Nellie, I would have ironed a Tee shirt. 

The signing came and went. Nearly a month later, in the wee morning hours, I was stumbling, blurry eyed through the living room to the bathroom and tripped over that ironing board! WTH!?! How did it get there? Where had it been? One of those things that just make you wonder.

***

The second event was much more unnerving for me, and took place a few weeks ago. This particular spring has been down right EVIL when it comes to allergy sufferers. So much so that the usual sinus meds have little to no effect. The news blames it on climate change, all I know is my sinuses have been driving me nuts. High pressure head/facial pain, constant mucus dripping causing me to cough. I went as far as shoving a wedge under the mattress at the head to help with the drainage at night, so I might get some rest. 

I was having the oddest dream where I was swimming under dark, murky water. I became disoriented; which way was up? I needed to get air. I was starting to drown - part of me remained logical; this was a dream. I can't swim, so obviously I wouldn't be swimming in reality. Just breath. But I can't! I can't seem to get any air. I'm starting to panic. I'm drowning. My lungs feel fit to burst. I hear someone call my name. 

The voice was so loud - like right in my face loud, that my eyes flew open. I struggle into a sitting position and begin projectile vomiting mucus. It's literally running from my nose and mouth, making quite the mess. My lungs were burning from lack of air. I sat in the mess, gulping air, forcing myself to breath in through the nose and out the mouth so not to hyperventilate. 

Needless to say, I never went back to bed that night. 

I have to wonder - from the way I felt on waking, and the amount of mucus, I was literally drowning in my bed, but was the voice a product of my subconscious or was it one of the friendlies, seeing my distress waking me? Guess I'll never know 100% for certain."
"Ghost Disappears Thru Closet Door","New Jersey","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","At the time, I was 14, and did a great amount of babysitting. One of the families I babysat for were very close neighbors that lived diagonally across the street from my house; Edith and Frank. They were foster parents of 4 children at the time.

It was Monday, June 17, 1968, again, I was 14 at the time. As kids, we were very close to Edith and Frank, and called them Aunt and Uncle, even though they were not actually family. It wasn't an unusual day, I had gone to school, and got home in the afternoon. My Mom had just gotten home from a little shopping with Aunt Edie (we called her that). She got a frantic call from Uncle Frank to come over right away. My Mom dropped everything and went across the street. Uncle Frank had called the ambulance; Aunt Edie was not breathing. After a horrible evening, we found that Aunt Edie had had a cerebral hemorrhage and passed away. We were all heartbroken to say the least due to the fact it was so sudden.

I continued to babysit, and especially spent a bunch of time at Uncle Frank's to give him a helping hand with the foster kids.

The next Friday, June 28, 1968, I was sitting for Uncle Frank, as he had to go out and do some things. It was especially strange, I was watching TV after I got the kids in bed. I have to say, I was NOT fond of the dark, and it was very weird being in the house as I was missing Aunt Edie.

This is the part that scared the living daylights out of me, and to this day (I am now 69), still freaks me out. I heard a noise upstairs, the baby was in the far bedroom in the crib, and that was it, I heard a little whimpering from that room. I went up the stairs, turned right down the hallway, and left into the room, I didn't turn the light on, but could still see with the little bit of light from the hallway, standing in front of the crib, looking in the crib, stood Aunt Edie! And she looked like you would think a ghost would look, airy and somewhat white see-through. She turned to me, looked at me, turned around, and floated right through the closet door! I could NOT believe what I had just seen. With all my strength, I opened the closet door to check, and she had disappeared!

I ran downstairs, went into the kitchen, grabbed the wall phone and called my Mom across the street! She came right over and spent the rest of that evening with me!

After that experience, YES - I do believe Aunt Edie had unfinished business since she died so suddenly - to check on the kids - well, and SCARE ME HALF TO DEATH!"
"Bad Dream Or Sleep Paralysis?","Mississippi","Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis","I recently stumbled on this website and I'd like to get your take on an experience I had two years ago.

First a little back ground. I'm a twenty-seven year old construction worker. I've never done drugs and at the time of the story I had and still have stopped drinking alcohol.

I'm what my mother explained to me is called an empath; I can pick up on feelings, emotions, and even experience them myself no matter how I was feeling previously. Like getting angry due to someone nearby even if I had been happy moments before.

I've had small paranormal experiences all my life. It ranges from whispers to feeling a presence and even seeing shadow figures.

This is my first experience with what I assume folks call sleep paralysis but I'm unsure if that's what it would be classified as.

One, day I came home from working a twelve hour shift. I had come back from working on an old house renovation. This home has been on the coast of Mississippi since about 1940 to 1950. While there the entire building felt heavy and almost depressing like someone turned on an energy vacuum and sucked it right out of you.

When I got home from work I was so exhausted that I decided to get straight to bed. I laid in my room all electronics including the TV off and slept for a bit.

I suddenly woke up do to a strange sensation, it was cold and I mean like cold fear gripping me. I tried to get up and look around but I couldn't move anything except my eyes. I tried forcing my body to move even mentally scream at it to move. I noticed the tv that was previously off before I fell asleep was now on.

I thought that was strange the tv was on a blue screen. Then I noticed this for lack of a better term crimson mist slowly spread across the tv and out of the mist appeared a horned black silhouette.

The silhouette seemed to be staring at me. When I saw it my blood ran cold. I began mentally freaking out ordering my body to move, but the most I could do is get my fingers to twitch slightly. 

As I lied there slowly losing it I felt a warmth suddenly envelope me and what felt like a hand on my back. Then I heard, ""Bojack, wake up.""

The only person whoever called me that was my grand father but he'd been gone for over a decade when this occurred. I blinked and whatever spell or what have you I was under was gone - I could move again. I looked at the tv. It was still on but the mist and figure were both gone. 

This is my first time experiencing anything like this at all and I'd like your take on what happened to me that day. I told this experience to my girlfriend now fiancé and she thinks it was just a bad dream.

What do y'all think if I may ask?"
"Meditation Encounter","Oklahoma","Psychic / Medium","I'm not sure how to start this really.

But here goes...

A little back history for this experience.

My mother's upbringing was quite tumultuous. Very chaotic, abusive etc. She brought that with her as she lived. She always had a dark cloud just lingering above her, and she never knew quite how to get out from under it. 

One evening I decided to try to help her clear some of the negative energy around her or at the very least get a glimpse of what it was that has been plaguing her. Just to try to figure out how I could help her, in some way. 

So I started off my meditation ritual, and soon ended up deep in.

I envisioned her, she was standing there. She was in the dark.

I began by asking for help with protecting her during this, and healing etc.

It was a good 30 minutes in when I was just about to end the session. All was going smooth until I envisioned a fire burning all that was not for her good, not of unconditional love, healing and protection around her protecting her from any negative, evil wrong doing. Encircling that was a dark blue light for protection and white light for healing.

I started to get a push back. I could feel it in my body and in the energy around her. I kept going repeating and envisioning the fire. And the push kept getting harder. The dark around her, looked and felt darker and stronger. 

As I kept going my body started to vibrate. The energy was so strong it pushed me out of my meditation. When I opened my eyes I sat straight up and realized I had been sweating and breathing hard. Much like I had been in a physical fight. 

I gave thanks to my spirit family and Team for the assistance and protection. I heard one of them say ""it is not safe, never again."" 

I promised I wouldn't, and I haven't since.

That was the one and only time I tried helping my mother in meditation."
"My Baby Son And The Open Closet Doors","California","Haunted Places","May 9, 2023, at 12:40 a.m.

 In the dead of night, I retreated into my quarters after securing the doors. As I was updating one of my ongoing stories on my Kindle, I left my wife to tend to our baby boy, who is not even three months old; he will be three months old on May 22, 2023. My wife put my son down and went to the restroom around 12:43 a.m., so the baby was alone in his crib for 7 minutes or so. I saw her when she went to the restroom, so I knew Jasper was alone. At 12:50 am, I had a distinct feeling of unease jolting through me, causing me to return to the room. 

To my dismay, the closet doors were wide open, which was concerning since my wife had seen me with her own eyes vividly close them, and I also remember closing them. I do this because of our baby's fascination with them; he stares way too much towards the closet. He also tends to always be staring all around the roof from side to side, which is not normal. Recently he started pointing, and it seems to me like he is pointing. He is not even 3 months old, but he is a very active and aware boy.

 I was so puzzled by the closet door mystery that I immediately questioned my teenagers' movements, both of whom denied ever entering my room. And my daughter was passed out in her quarters. This left me perplexed - who opened the closet doors?

 Furthermore, my baby's antics were mind-boggling, with him giggling and staring unblinkingly at the ceiling and the darkest corners of the room. Something in my home wasn't right. My son's preoccupation with the closet was especially apparent, considering babies aren't typically fascinated by those spaces. Every time I looked up from my writing, my son was staring at the top of the closet, making me more and more anxious by the minute. I'm worried about my son's welfare, but I can't decide if this was an innocent coincidence or otherwise. In an attempt to rule out the paranormal, I set up two cameras in the room to monitor my son's activities. As parents, we must never leave anything to chance where our children's safety is concerned. 

 Even though we've been monitoring the situation, our surveillance system has not captured any evidence of the strange phenomena. This led us to explore alternative solutions, such as using a ghost tube app.

 Continuing on with the updates regarding the strange and unexplainable events unfolding in our home, I feel it is necessary to add a bit more context that might shed some light on the situation. As a long-time believer in spiritual entities, I have witnessed many unusual occurrences over the years and felt that it was only fitting to explore and understand these events better by using a ghost tube app. In the initial stages of using this app, we didn't see or capture anything out of the ordinary, but that quickly changed with recent sessions. Strangely, whenever I asked questions through the app, the stick figures would move to signify their response, and more often than not, they would say something directed at me specifically. The words ""Kop, Bill, fear me"" that the app delivered were wholly jarring, and it still amazes me that these entities could potentially harm my family and me. It's clear that there's more to this situation than meets the eye, and I can't help but feel that we're walking a fine line between safety and endangerment.

 While I was holding Jasper during the communication, the app mentioned the words ""kiss, care, above, bike, mesas, bastante, esperar, genero, and viejo."" Although I couldn't decipher their significance, it was clear that they were unrelated and out of context. At the same time, Jasper began coughing and felt anxious, leading me to take him outside for his well-being. Throughout my session, I've also received other messages with different words like ""levitation, follow, help, lemon, Michael, if, night, quitter, insomnia,"" among others. However, I'm still struggling to understand their meaning and importance in this situation.

 During the same sessions, I heard the app say, ""Alexander above,"" in a tone that insinuated a conjunction. While I was aware that it didn't make sense on the surface, I felt in my gut that it had some significance. Similarly, the phrase ""fear me"" repeatedly delivered by the app was a clear indication that the spirits or entities in question had malevolent intentions. Despite the fact that my name Alexander and my son's name Jasper were both uttered in my last session, the app directed the words ""You stopped after I completed an ""OUR FATHER PRAYER"""" in my room. I have come to notice that the stick figures direct their attention towards me and Jasper; it's a very eerie and unsettling feeling to be aware of this. One thing is clear: They're attempting to cause harm. I hope that I am wrong and that all they want to do is communicate something. Jasper's behavior became erratic and wearisome after they said his name out loud, and he got a cough right after. So I told my son, ""Let's go outside,"" and the spirit box app responded with ""do not."" It was clearly telling me not to take my son out of the room. But still worried and unsure of the situation and our safety, I decided to keep my son Jasper very close to me; if I don't have him, my wife does, or one of our children. Can't leave him alone. These messages were eerie and unsettling, making it clear that we must be cautious and pay attention to any clues concerning our safety.

 In conclusion, we remain committed to the safety of our family and will continue to monitor the situation closely. We've explored whatever methods we feel are safe and available to us. I believe that there's more to uncover about what's happening in our home, and if needed, we'll seek professional help and guidance to resolve this long-standing issue. Thanks for your understanding and support. All of these events have taken a great emotional toll on me and Jasper, and it's challenging to cope with this situation while ensuring his safety. I'll continue to monitor the situation, and if needed, I'll seek the required help. Until then, I promise to keep you updated on any new developments. Thank you for reading. Sincerely,  Alexander Sanchez, Jasper's father"
"The Day My Father Died","Minnesota","Family / Friends Visits","I don't know if this story falls under ghost stories or paranormal experiences, but I am sharing a very personal experience for me. As the title states it is a day I will never forget! 

My father was in hospice care at home. He laid motionless on his deathbed struggling and gasping for every breath. You could slowly see the life withdrawing from a once proud man. With every gasp for air we knew his time was coming, and it could be at anytime. My entire family was there surrounding him, weeping holding his hand. 

Then my mom remembered that my dad had a last wish when he was still able to talk. Sensing his demise he had previously told my mother he wanted to go in a nice suit and tie as he had grown up poor. We scrambled to dress him in the suit he had picked out. Then we realized his tie was missing. I sent my wife home to retrieve one of my ties and my brother to the store to buy one. Who ever got back the fastest we were going to use that tie. 

As we waited and time passed my father's breaths became shallower. Then my wife finally returned and so did my brother. As we rushed to tie the tie, I threw mine together quickly and it wasn't as nice, so my mother untied it and tied it into how my father liked it. We placed it over his head and into the collar. My mother cinched the knot nicely and as she withdrew her hand, my father passed right there and then. We all cried instantly knowing he waited so patiently. 

Later that evening as my family gathered to remember him, we all sat in the living room just sharing family stories. It had just gotten dark and the door bell rang. We all thought it was another relative stopping by to pay their respects. My mother closest to the door answered it. But there was no one there, thinking nothing of it she closed it. Then it rang again and with same result. My mother burst out in tears again as she knew and we all knew it was just him stopping by and saying goodbye one last time."
"A Premonition And His Voice","Arizona","Family / Friends Visits","Almost a year ago I woke from a strange dream. I dreamt that my partner's dresser was missing from our bedroom and I was staring at an empty space. I awoke with a very uncomfortable feeling and tried my best to rationalize the dream as being more related to the fact we had new bedroom furniture on layaway at a local store and the dresser would be going. Still, though, something didn't feel right. In the past I have had dreams before pets have passed. Usually I dream something of theirs is missing (a pet bed, cage, etc.) and I get a very foreboding feeling. This was the first time I had ever had this happen where it involved a person.

Last Memorial Day weekend, May 28th, 2022, to be precise, my partner was accidentally killed when his gun fired just as we were turning in for the night. It was a tragic accident and to this day I don't understand how this happened. I really feel that the dream I had earlier was a premonition of what was to come although I could hardly glean it would be the harbinger of something so tragic. The bullet missed me and to this day, I don't know how I am still here.

As part of my healing, I stayed up in a northern Arizona town on weekends where I'd journal, rest, cry, and just relax. Over this past Thanksgiving weekend, I decided to read back in the journal I had kept since the accident. I have journaled since I was 12 years old and have always loved the aspect that we can track our progress and growth by simply reading back. 

I got into bed with my notebook and started to read. As I reached more current times, my eyes started to close and the notebook would fall towards my face, jerking me back awake. After a few times of this happening, I set the notebook down and started to drift off. Somewhere in between that still awake and almost asleep state, I heard my partner's voice as if he were talking right into my ear. His voice was unmistakable. He told he was so proud of me. I could hear the intonation of the words. I immediately sat up in bed and said out loud, ""I heard you! I heard you!"" 

He could clearly see what I was doing. He had to have known I was reading back on my journey through grieving his loss. It gives me hope that our loved ones are always with us. A lot of my friends have had signs so I was happy that is was finally my turn. Months later I can still replay this back in my mind. I memorized all of it. Every syllable. 

I haven't had much more happen after that. I've asked for a few signs here and there, and he has always come through. On occasion I will smell pipe smoke in the house when no one has been smoking. Thanks for reading."
"A Few Experiances","Michigan","Haunted Places","I will start by saying that I have always believed in ghosts but never thought I would experience anything, until recently.

The biggest experience I had started after my brother unfortunately passed away. I think he visited me a few times after he died for the following reasons.

1) I let my brother live with me for a few years. I would find the light on in the room that was his. I hadn't been in that room for six months so I know it wasn't me. Even if it was me I would have noticed that it was on at some point. This happened multiple times. I would turn it off just to find it on the next day.

2) I would wake up in the morning to find the living room tv was on. I had the tv set to turn off after one hour of inactivity so it could not have been on that long, I am also really good at turning things off after myself. My brother had the habit of never turning lights or tvs off.

3) I would find my car keys on the kitchen table where he would leave then on the occasion I let him borrow my car. I never put them there.

4) After he passed I got his xbox1. While I am aware that the system does have a glitch that causes it to turn itself on there are a few things I cannot explain. The first being the system turned on 5 times in a row. If its the glitch its one time and its done for a few days. In the instance I would turn it off get two steps away and it would turn back on. I said hi to my brother and the instance stopped. The following morning I unplugged the system. I got home from work the system was plugged back in and turned on.

Things stopped after a month or so.

I have a radio from 1928 I wonder if it has a spirit attached to it. It has doors on it that lock. The doors occasionally open themselves even if locked. My pet birds act spooked whenever I carry them passed it.

I also had on occasion to wake up to someone yelling HEY right in my face. I have also heard what sounds like sneezing coming from the living room. I live alone so I cannot explain why this would be.

Thanks"
"Stick Indians?","Washington","Haunted Places","In 1987, I was looking for and purchased a 1+ acre lot for $3,000 off of an Indian Reservation in Mason County, Washington (30 minutes from my work). I was making payments as I lived there, and I paid the property off in 1989. I would go out to the property whenever I had time. It was a beautiful drive up the river, with the winding river down below on my left, and steep hillside to the right (road was cut out of hill), more like a bumpy logging road. 

I headed up to go camp on my property one weekend. Prior to that, I had always just waved at the Native man, a woman and 3 kids when I drove by, if they were outside. On this day, I decided to stop and introduce myself, so I pulled down into the driveway of the property with trash everywhere. I started walking up to the porch and noticed to my left two white blobs that I eventually realized were perfectly skinned large beavers laying on their backs, lined up like trophies. Seeing this made me sad. They weren't for food, but just for pelts. So, I knocked and introduced myself, telling the Native I had purchased property about 1 mile upriver from him. I told him I would be camping on the property and playing around the river. He told me that the Indians don't sleep in the woods there because of the ""Stick Indians."" I don't remember too much more about our conversation. But, as I was leaving, he wanted to show me his catch from a recent saltwater fishing trip down the road from there. I followed him to the other side of the boat in his yard and I saw 15 very small illegal-sized Red Cod that had been filleted and thrown everywhere. After seeing that, I really wanted to get out of there, so headed to my property. I had no issues at the property and eventually had my A-frame style Chalet home built, finally moving in by mid-1990. I had no power for 6 months and no water for over a year.

I was single at the time of moving in, and my bedroom was in the upper half of the top floor of the Chalet (called a Crow's Nest), and I could look down into my living room. The A-frame peak was in the middle of my bed, and the upper floor walls leaned into the peak, kind of cramped around the bed. The window was directly above the head of my bed - no drapes were needed at that height. I was alone in the woods.

On this one night, I was awakened by an all-consuming constant high-vibration rattle. If you can picture a wood tube half-filled with 500 metal B-Bs in it being shaken as fast as possible, that would be close to describing the sound. Or, shaking seeds in an over-sized pod times 1,000. It is so hard to describe the constant and rhythmic deafening sound it was making throughout my house and the upstairs room. I can't give this justice in words. I quickly sat up in bed and thought maybe there was a craft above my home. But, looking out the window, it was dark, and I could see the trees 10 feet away out my bedroom window. When the rattling started, scared may not be the word, but maybe disbelief, or partial panic? The sound was a menacing overwhelming rattle that lasted maybe 10 minutes or longer, and it freaked me out. I could not imagine having been sleeping outside or in a tent and hearing this. I was 12 feet off the ground in my home, protected by wood walls. In the 8 years I owned that property, that only happened once, and in the dark. I wondered later if it was the Stick Indians and maybe they weren't happy that I had built there. I am not a hunter but have taken a lot of Salmon out of that river. What a beautiful place to live all of those years. 

Thanks for reading, and good luck out there. (Typed and edited by wife)"
"Is Something Paranormal Happening To Me?","Kentucky","Misc","Firstly, I would like to say that I have been reading stories on this website for 10+ years and like to consider myself knowledgeable about the paranormal. I'm not very good with grammar/correct sentences so please bare with me. I've had various paranormal encounters throughout my life that I plan on sharing soon, but the last week has been extremely strange to me. I want to give context that there have been rumors and many people all over my city claiming that the land the shopping center my workplace is built on used to be an Indian Burial ground? I'm not sure how true that is but the shopping center is very very expensive with expensive stores and expensive people walking around, I'm sure if I were a ghost on this land I would be p*ssed to see what it is today, honestly. 

 It started off with something non-paranormal last week, we had a PowerPoint at work where my male coworkers were given a female coworker to describe in 3 words as a recognition activity. My coworker jokingly put ""kind, haunted, and unique,"" for me. My other coworkers laughed about it, but a few have brought it up to me since, insinuating that I am actually haunted. 

 Maybe 5 days ago I was at work with a customer facing the wall with products on it. My mind felt quiet as the customer was busy doing something, and in my peripheral (maybe 10 feet to the right of where I was looking already) 2 products fall off the wall. Nobody had walked past recently, I personally adjust things on this wall a lot and things never fall off of that wall? It was so odd and before I knew it my feet took me over there and I picked them up and put them back where they were, confused. These products weigh less than a pound, but like I said they never fall off the wall... By themselves.

 The next day I come home from work and am playing my PS4 sitting in my normal chair when I get the feeling of someone blowing cold air onto the left side of my face. I move my head to the right and it follows so I relax, and start feeling cold air on my left hand that's holding the controller in my lap. I have experienced a spirit blowing cold air in my face before, years ago, so this was not the first time I've experienced this feeling, what made it so odd is I've lived in this house for a year and never felt that before.

 I asked my partner if the A/C was on and she said no, the heat is on. What makes it worse is that the chair I'm sitting in is in the middle of the living room literally, with no vents around, no fan no moving air whatsoever. I asked her to come and feel where I was feeling this cold cold air and she couldn't feel anything. This ""encounter,"" lasted a total of maybe 30 seconds, I even tried to take my hand and fan myself to try and reenact the feeling and it was nowhere near what I felt. 

 Now today, I go to work for 7 hours and about 2 hours into my shift I'm talking to a customer and start rubbing my left arm and look down and see in the area from the top back/side of my wrist there's a 2-3 inch long scratch going towards my elbow, and a much wider scratch closer to my elbow going down, and then one on my elbow. 3 scratches total and when I say, ""wider,"" I mean the scratches are made up of 1-4 lines of little small scratches up close, from afar it's just red and blotchy some of it has already started healing but it's been 8 hours and they're still burning. 

 I am someone that is super super aware of my body especially when it comes to wounds/scratches/pain. I was in the middle of working when I noticed it and I was not around one sharp thing today! If I ever scratch or hurt myself I always notice immediately and am so fast to run to get antibiotic ointment and Band-Aids! I am someone who will encounter something paranormal but ignore it/not engage as I know better, and do my best to stay out of their way. Any advice? Thank you for reading if you've read this far!"
"7 Times Pull My Feet, Still Happening Today","Nevada","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I will make my story short so you are not reading all day.

 My brother passed away in July 2020. After he passed away, say about a month later I was visited in my dream by what appeared to be him. He said, ""Bruce come see where I am at, its a great place"", and started to pull my feet.

 I said, ""Skip, I need to accomplish more on earth,, I will see you again. But for now I need to stay here."" He smirked at me like he usually does, and went away as I woke up... 

The next time was about 2 weeks latter, this time I saw it was my brother, and he kept pulling on my ankles, saying, ""this way."" And I woke up again. 

I put salt in front of my door. That didn't help, and until this date of Feb 16 2023, some thing is still pulling at my feet.

On the 3rd time, it was a dark figure in the shadows pulling at my feet, until I kicked it off and woke up. 

On the 4th time, I was sleeping, I heard my brothers wife, who also passed away 6 months after my brother. And she punched me in the chest while I was sleeping and my winter coat that I had on exploded like a jet blast had hit it.

 A small back story to this; she told me on the phone after my brother had died she wanted to punch me in the chest for not visiting my brother while he was dying. Although I drove all night to see him from Vegas to Colorado Springs, I could not muster the courage to see another brother dying. This was my second brother to pass away, there are 4 brothers and one sister. I spent the night at the hotel and made a round trip back to Vegas. So my sister in-law got her revenge. I was a wreck... Till this day I am getting my ankles pulled, and some times even when I am awake the entity is still trying to drag me to hell, I'm guessing. 

It just happened a few days ago, it was a struggle to get the entity off of me. I am 70 years old and afraid to go to sleep. I also live in a well to do old folks neighborhood, where, in order for a house to go up for sale, usually some one has died in it. These home are 22 years old. So that might have some thing to do with it, but the first 2 times it was my true brother pulling at my feet.

 But when I told this story, other people have told me it might be evil entities posing as my brother and not to go with them. I am strong enough still to oppose these entities so at times they leave me alone. And this is my first time with evil spirits, I am still afraid to go to sleep because I will never know when they come back. They only pull my feet, and once my sister in-law punched me in the chest like she said she was going to do. 

It's all very freakish living in this house for the last 3 years. Any ideas? It's 12:50am,, and I look at the clock every night,, getting anxiety waiting to go to sleep. I usually don't go to sleep until I can not stay awake. 

Any help? I won't burn sage because it smells like pot. Salt doesn't make sense to me, telling them to stay away works for a while. My occurrences are around 3am to 4am. 

Thanks for reading.

"Incredible Orb Footage","Missouri","Orbs / Lights / Mists","I have been recording hundreds of orbs in my yard the last few nights.

Can only be seen on infrared. Too cold for bugs. No precipitation or wind. I don't think they are artifacts. I have 4 cameras showing the same anomalies. 

I walked out into the yard numerous times thinking I should be able to see them and I never do. Only on infrared.

I have seen orb footage many times. Never anything like this. Some of these go behind objects and reappear on the other side. Some leave the field of view and can only be seen again after the tracking camera catches up with them.

Many leave the ground and shoot into the sky. Some are very slow and some whiz by in just 2-3 frames. They seem to pulsate.

They appear by the hundreds each night and you can see on the footage that the sky is clear and the wind is not blowing. Its freezing out and Missouri doesn't have any bugs that fly around in freezing weather. Bugs would show up without the infrared anyhow.

Anyone can feel free to take the footage and slow it down, play with the contrast or whatever. I was unable to make it any better so I left it as is. I did figure out how to slow down some of the more interesting events.

If there is a better way to share this video or a better place, let me know. I have no problems with that. I didn't see a place to upload media.

I uploaded the video to YouTube as I didn't know how else to share it. The link to my footage:

"Why Did It Come To Me?","Oklahoma","Misc","First let me begin by saying Thank you for taking the time to read this. It's greatly appreciated. 

A little back story to before this experience happened.

My husband and I had recently reconciled after 11 months long separation. Which has almost resulted in a divorce. We have 4 children together (3 adults now and the youngest in her last 2 years of high school). 

And to our surprise this reconnect resulted in my pregnancy.

I am a practicing eclectic witch, so I have protection in place. But in the midst of the chaos I had neglected some of the my protections. This may be important later on. 

This one particular morning, my husband had left for work and I decided to lay back down in the bed. I didn't have to work that day, so I decided to get a few more hours of sleep as this was the earlier stage in my pregnancy. 

I had the TV on, and I decided to lay down and watch the early morning news until my eyes grew heavy. 

I was wide awake, so I knew I'd lay there for a while. I wasn't comfortable on my left side, so I turned onto my back, put my right arm over my eyes and laid there for maybe between 10-15 seconds. I could still hear the news reporter talking about the weather, when the right side of the bed sank down suddenly. It felt as though something was big enough to make that entire side of the bed sink down. 

I was instantly on alert, and didn't want to move. And then the vision came in. As I lay there an entity of a demon like man started to crawl over me, but not on top of me. At first he had scraggly long dark hair, and trench coat and a huge body and face. Then he suddenly turned into this demon that continued to hover over me but not touching me until his tongue protruded from his mouth and licked my left arm which was on the left side of pillow. I could actually feel the tongue, which felt like a cat's tongue.

It's tongue wasn't connected to its mouth. It protruded out but wasn't connected. 

I heard a voice saying ""don't breath in its breath"". So I tried holding my breath for a few seconds when it started to laugh. It knew I couldn't for very long. I hadn't taken a deep breath that would allow me to. In a panic I suddenly shut my mouth. As I was trying to hold my mouth closed, it started to blow onto my face, a dark black mist was coming out of its mouth. I had to breath somehow, so I began to breath short breaths through my nose. 

I started to think of the baby and protecting him/her. At that time we didn't know the gender. 

I tried my hardest not to breath its breath, but I couldn't help it. 

It continued to laugh and it started to lift up and away from me. That's when I got a look at it. 

It had a dark red and black face. Vision the Jeepers Creepers face, without the nasty shine to it, and horns that came straight out and then bend back. Those too were black with red tint. He continued laughing and then dissipated. 

I waited a few seconds before moving, and then lifted my arm off of my face, sat straight up and was in complete shock. 

I still don't know what it was wanting or trying to do. But I have amped up protection around the home and for myself, baby and family."
"Water Street","Washington","Haunted Places","There is a neighborhood called Peaceful Valley not far from downtown Spokane, Washington. It is indeed a valley, in the lowest part of the city downstream from the famous ""Falls"" of the Spokane river. It was established in the late 1800's as an area of modest, small affordable houses built primarily by the Scandinavian working-class emigrants. Many of these homes were diminutive bare-bones ""shotgun"" houses with few fanciful decorations or amenities, and were built very close together on small lots. The area doesn't seem to receive its fair share of sunshine, and definitely seems to have a ""feeling"" about it. In the 1970's, it came to be known as a sort of ""hippie"" community, largely inhabited by the counterculture--and the go-to neighborhood to go shopping for items not available over-the-counter at the local drugstore!

I've heard that Spokane and Seattle lay claim to being among the most haunted cities in Washington State, and Spokane has no shortage of documented paranormal activity. It should be noted that history shows that white settlement in the area was less than kind to the Native population, where many bloody battles were fought. There are thought to be several ancient burial grounds that were developed over in the pioneering days of the city. The great river running through town (formerly a noted salmon fishing area to the indigenous population) is the subject of much folklore and paranormal mystique, and has claimed many lives over the years. The nearby Monroe St. Bridge has long been the go-to for suicidal jumpers (the bridge itself is said by some to be haunted), and not far downstream at the confluence with another small river is said to harbor all manner of whim-whams, itself being a noted Native burial ground. PV is located between the two. Looming above is the towering Maple St. Bridge, built in the late 1950's to connect the two tall riverbanks. It's my understanding that a worker fell to his death during its construction, and again during restoration work some years back.

On to my story: there is a short street adjacent to the river called Water Street (technically Water Avenue; we've always called it Water Street as there was once a punk band of the same name). It was here that once stood, off the street and towards the river, a casket factory. Long since closed, it remained a creepy boarded-up abandoned building that scared kids and made for much speculation before finally being razed decades later.

Many years ago, a friend (an ex-GF, actually) rented a house with some other girls almost directly under the MSB (a dropped hammer once fell through the roof during the aforementioned bridge reconstruction). I can't recall if the coffin shop was still extant at that time. Built in 1900, it was a dumpy, ramshackle (and cheap) affair, built on to over the years into a long, rectangular structure that extended back on the lot with the rear coming very close to the water. It was rumored that it was once a house of ill-repute of some sort or the other, and definitely seemed to carry some air of bad ju-ju to it.

This was known to be a bit of a ""party house,"" and once a friend and I were relaxing there, smoking pot and having a brewski. The only ones in the room at the time, we were sitting facing each other on couches set 90 degrees to each other along the walls at a corner in the front living room. Suddenly, out of nowhere and without warning, we heard an unexplainable, fairly loud (and quite frightening) sound equidistant between us. While we saw nothing, we both stared directly at the source of the noise, which I pictured in my mind as a miniature tornado about 18"" or so high emanating from the floor. The cacophony had a definite swirling quality to it, accompanied by an evil growling/snarling sort of noise. I've since described it as sounding like ""A garbage disposal from hell.""

Visibly startled, we recoiled in wide-eyed disbelief. My buddy looked at me aghast, and said ""What the **** was that?! Was that you, dude?"" Both silently knowing it was not, we hurriedly vacated the premises. Granted, we were less than sober, but no amount of impairment would've caused anything like what we simultaneously witnessed! You can imagine how my hand flew to my mouth some years later when I learned what a Vortex was.

Several years later, another close friend moved back to town after being away for a few years, and temporarily stayed with another mutual friend of ours who happened to live in the neighboring house a couple hundred yards to the east, past where the (now gone) casket factory stood. This small house actually stood next door to a quaint home featured in an on-set location for the 1990's Johnny Depp movie ""Benny and Joon.""

Not long after moving in, he was alone in the house when he heard a faint, crackling static noise and the kind of ""wheeeee-ooo"" modulation sound when tuning in an old AM or ham radio, and made out what he described as an ""old-timey newsreel/broadcasting voice"" fading in and out but managed to clearly pick up the phrase, ""We got a jumper on the Maple St. Bridge!"" before vanishing as quickly as it came. 

He was understandably a bit freaked out, and set about locating a possible source... He examined the stereo, which was confirmed to be turned off. He grappled with the idea of relating the story to his roommate, and finally did so. Their faces both turned a bit white when he replied, ""Dude--the same thing happened to me a couple of weeks ago!"" Same phrase and everything.

The latter was a second-hand story, but I've no reason to doubt it, especially being in such close proximity to my first-hand experience. Understandably, the whole neighborhood (and that block in particular) kind of gives me the heebie-jeebies! I'm eager to hear of any other unexplained phenomenon in the region."
"Tap On The Leg?","Georgia","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I wasn't going to write about this, but can't NOT, as I would love your input.

This happened just last night at 3am almost exactly. 

My bedroom is just down a very short hall from the front foyer of our suburban home, which is in a very quiet subdivision in an ATL suburb. There are two outdooor lights that stay on all night & light up our foyer quite a bit, so my room is probably lighter than I want it, but... Security & lots of glass doors. My husband has been sleeping for about a year now in the back of the house -- through the living room and the kitchen to the family room in his recliner... He says it's the only place he can sleep after having hip replacement surgery, no problem, I suppose we're getting old, haha. 

Went to bed normally last evening around midnight and was fully asleep and dreaming to where I can still remember the dream, which was nothing out of the ordinary... Something about my old college town. It became apparent somewhere in my dream that there was a tap, tap, tap on my right calf (I was sleeping on my left side under lots of covers, so the tap was not meek). As I became aware, but not sure if it was part of my dream or perhaps even the beginning of a charlie horse I continued to come out of a deep sleep. I mention the charlie horse thing because I had experienced my first one since childhood just a few weeks ago while sleeping & it was not fun, so I guess that's where my brain was taking me in the moment. 

My entire right hand was alseep and I had a nagging thought that perhaps my heart rate had slowed a lot. I was diagnosed & treated for A-fib last October, likely as a one time side effect of the covid virus which I had last August... They corrected it with an electric shock in October & I've been pretty normal since then except for these meds which thin the blood & slow your heart. 

I've always been healthy, a runner, now swim every other day 45 minutes, so my rate tends to stay lower anyway, but this is something I'm probably too aware of & plan to ask about at next appointment. (sorry, boring). 

Anyway,since my hand was asleep, I thought all this quickly & wanted to move around to get the blood circulating, though I felt fine. So I stood up, all this in my mind but also confused by the compelling ""tap, tap, tap"" on my calf which woke me. 

I stood up next to my bed, noting one loyal husky/border collie dog was right at my feet, next to where my legs had been (though the bed itself is quite tall & the dogs never get on it). She was still sleeping soundly. Just then I noticed a bright flash of light to my left, corner of my eye in the direction of the foyer. It was large & fast, completely unexpected. I'm going to admit, my mind was now racing & the first thing I thought of was people on this forum who say lights flashing in one's peripheral vision can sometimes mean angels. I walked out through the foyer, turning left into the living room, which has basically a wall of windows high & low (so the flash could've originated out there). But I heard NO cars on the street, my mind quickly trying to rule out a flash of headlights, which would be very unusual at 3am on a Monday morning. Also, had not checked the time yet. 

Continuing to sort through this, I thought perhaps husband had walked to the bathroom next to our room without me hearing him & perhaps turned on bathroom light & closed the door. That might've explain the flash in the corner of my eye, but that wasn't the case. I walked through the Livingroom & kitchen, the other dog still asleep there -- to hear husband snoring from his recliner, which was at least 60 feet & three rooms away from my bed. All was perfectly quiet. 

I went back to my room, checked the time. It was 3:03 a.m. I was shivering more than normal, but then it was colder last night. 

Was there someone telling me I needed to wake up & get my heart pumping faster again? Well, THAT certainly got it going!

Years ago after my mom died, I was asleep one morning an felt a very light touch on my hand. This was different, not harsh but insistant, a repeated attempt to wake me. I think I feel ok about it, protected maybe. But that flash... Would love to know.

One last thing FYI: last night upon going to bed I prayed my usual Lord's Prayer, thanked God (I'm a Christian) & asked for health & safety for my family as I regularly do. I added, ""Protect this house"" which I attribute to my watching a lot of the Slapped Ham You Tube channel over the weekend. Am I watching/reading too much unexplained stuff? What's too much?"
"Past Christmas Visitation","New York","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","This story is a short one from my past. A personal encounter that has stuck with me throughout the years and I recently talked about during my last Christmas trip to see my family. It's amazing what comes up when we sit around and talk about the past, with my family, inevitably ghost stories always turn up!

I was around 10-11 when this happened in my childhood home. My bedroom was at the end of a hall and at the time, my bed was positioned in such a way where I could look down the length of the hall to the stairwell. From this vantage point on the right (from the bed) was my parent's room. The next door down was my brothers and only a few feet down was the stairs. The only rooms on the left were a spare (junk) room and the bathroom which was directly across from the stairs. I could see all this from my bed. It was just the 4 of us living in the house. There was a window at the end of the hall near the stairs that allowed some light into the hall at night. 

Now my dad never got up during the night at all, when he went to bed, he didn't emerge from the bedroom until he got up for the day. My mom on the other hand got up to use the bathroom several times at night, but her routine was always the same. She would leave the door to the bedroom open while she was up and they always had a fan running at night, and you could hear it well when the door was open, and not so much when it was closed. My brother didn't have a door at the time as such, but a curtain strung across his door to close his room off. I always left my door open at night.

Now that I've described the set up, this event happened in December. One winter night, I was lying in bed trying to fall asleep. Everyone was in bed. I glanced down the hall towards my brother's room and saw something strange. There were a few shadows in the hall but there seemed to be cluster near my brother's door. There was light from the window, reflected from the snow and streetlights. I had been to bed for some time and though I hadn't yet fallen asleep, my eyes were adjusted to the dark. 

As I stared, the shadows seemed to resolve into a figure standing at my brother's door. I don't know if they became a figure or as I stared I just realized a figure was there. Either way as I continued watching, it looked like a man, looking into my brother's room. 'He' seemed to have a hand on either side of the door post to support himself as he leaned his head into the doorway, apparently watching my brother. 'He' was looking past the curtain.

 I couldn't believe I was seeing this. My parent's door was closed, I didn't hear the fan, so they weren't up and this figure seemed taller than anyone in my family anyways. I knew my brother was asleep in his room and besides this man or whatever was much bigger than my younger brother anyways. 

I don't know if 'he' realized I was watching him or not. I had difficulty accepting what was happening, yet at the same time, felt no fear. I didn't try to hide, I just observed 'him', fascinated. It couldn't have been more than a few minutes, but the figure straightened up and pulled his head out of the curtain/doorway. 'He' then sidestepped to the stairs, staying close to the wall. It was only a few feet but the stairwell was engulfed in shadow, so 'he' seemed to either dissolve or melt into the shadows and I could no longer see 'him'. The hall seemed to be empty again and as I started trying to sort out what happened, the top stair creaked. For anyone who lives in a home with steps that creak, after awhile, you can tell, which step it is from the sound and whether it's just the house settling or someone putting their weight on it! That's the moment it became all too real for me!

I know I said something the next morning to my mom about it. She simply told me it was probably Santa Claus checking on us to be sure we were being good, since Christmas was right around the corner. I'm pretty sure what I saw wasn't good ole Saint Nick!

I've puzzled about it over the years. I know at times being alone and downstairs, I've heard noises that sounded like someone was upstairs, but that could've been my imagination. My mom mentioned to me when I was older, that the stairs sometimes gave her the creeps, and at times when she used to the bathroom, she felt as if she was being watched (since it was right across from the stairs). The house has been almost completely renovated over the years and those feelings are long since gone. 

As a footnote, when I stay with my parent's now, I sleep in my brother's old room (which now has a door) and have never felt even slightly uncomfortable in there.

The only conclusion I've come to is that it was a relative who passed or perhaps a guide or angel that was checking up on my brother. It wasn't scary, just puzzling. I don't believe from their behavior they expected to be spotted and appeared to try and be inconspicuous. 

Either way I thought I would share!"
"Night Gown","California","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","In 1992, at the age of 16 I had moved in with my Aunt for a short while. It was during that stay, that I experienced my second paranormal encounter. 

The first time I saw the little girl, I was not alone. My aunt was also witness. While talking amongst ourselves, we happen to notice a young girl standing outside towards the edge of the road. She looked to be 10 years of age, and was just standing there looking at us. It was how she looked, and what she was wearing that stuck out to me. She had long dirty blonde hair, that looked as though she hadn't brushed it in a while or bathed either. She appeared to be wearing a long night gown, something I remember seeing and wearing as a little girl in the early 1980s. This was odd to me, because it was the middle of the afternoon. Naturally my Aunt and I became focused on the girl and watched as she just stood there staring at us and then running off into the vacant piece of land next to my Aunts house and vanish. We couldn't believe it! We said nothing about it to each other.

 A little more time went by without any other occurrences. Until one day I happened to be looking out the same window that we had seen the little girl in and there she was. Like the last time she was just standing there, staring at me. We stood staring at each other for a couple minutes, before she once again took off running into the lot and disappeared. 

I knew by this time I wasn't imagining this and became curious about her. I decided I was going to try to investigate, so I went outside and made my way over to the vacant lot. I didn't know what exactly I was doing or what I was looking for, but I kept walking through the lot. Eventually I came to a small group of manzanita trees. Something drew me to the middle of the trees. In the middle of these trees was a bare area of dirt. I felt compelled to start toiling away at this spot. I found a stick nearby and began to dig at the earth. Almost like I was a puppet being engineered by a puppeteer. I recall seeing everything I was doing it, but it seemed like I was being controlled. The stick I was digging with, eventually got stuck into something that wasn't dirt or a rock. I then pulled it up out of the ground and was shocked to see a piece of material hanging on the end of my stick. As I stood there looking at this material, it dawned on me that it looked a lot like the fabric on the night gown that little girl had been wearing. I immediately dropped the stick and high tailed it back to my aunt's house, trying to process everything. I didn't know what to do. I avoided looking over towards that land again after that.

 Nothing happened the days that followed, until one of my last nights at my Aunt's house. It was late and I couldn't sleep. I was wide awake in the room I was staying in. This room was adjacent to the lot and the window to this room was directly in the area about 50 feet away, where I had found the material. While I was sitting in the room I happened to hear a child's laughter. Naturally I paused to have a better listen. Clearly I could hear a little girl giggling, and when I looked up I noticed a little face peering in the bedroom window. I felt pretty uneasy with the way she was looking at me and the sinister smile she had. I sat there staring back at her, for what seemed like an eternity. I couldn't stand it anymore and decided to push a large Armour in front of the window to block the girl from looking in the window any longer. This helped in that way, but did not help in blocking out the eerie giggles that I had to listen to for the rest of the night.

 I remember laying in bed trying to drown her out, and that's all I remember until I woke up the next morning. When I got dressed that morning, I noticed a deep cut in my abdomen about the size of a small child's nail. I still have a scar from it today. I moved out of my Aunt's house shortly thereafter and never returned. I have often wondered about the girl and whether or not anyone else has had a run in with her."
"Foreign Language In The Night","Georgia","Misc","Have any of you ever dreamed in a foreign language? Or gotten short messages that way? 

Today, while looking in my i-phone notes for the password to my bank -- I can NEVER remember all these passwords -- I ran across something I'd written there in the middle of the night weeks ago with only a vague recollection of it. It said ""ook sein pond."" 

It was a little astonishing. I'd resolved a couple years ago to write down significant things that ""join"" my vivid dreams & already had one incident that can't be explained except for my theory. The idea is, when I wake up with a thought that seems unusual, I'll remind myself by writing a note in my phone for morning & then look it up. It started when I woke one time with the word ""fegnet"" in my head, almost as if someone had just printed it on a white board in my head. I visualized it: ffegnet, in a pretty script. I remembered it somehow & searched the internet next morning for some meaning, it meant nothing to me. An antique German Christmas card on E-bay was about the only thing I found with the word written in a fancy script in a poem. I typed the line into translate & something about being blessed came up. That wasn't satisfying enough for me, so I wrote to a German professor whose name I found online to ask him if there was anything else he could tell me about the word. He wrote back & told me the word is actually ""segnet."" Which is a verb meaning blessed. He told me the script from the card (I'd sent him a clip) was written in an old German gothic script in which s's look like two small f's. So no wonder I could not find much about it, I'd been typing in the wrong word. 

Meanwhile, my hobby is ancestry & I realized that this word dream thing had happened very near to the day I'd gone to the local historic National Cemetery to visit the grave of an ancestor I never realized existed. He was killed in the Battle of Peachtree Creek in Atlanta --a New York man who was my 2nd great uncle & whose grave I've been driving past almost 20 years without realizing it! The discovery that my uncle was killed in Atlanta -- I know almost exactly where he died based on descriptions of the battle -- was even more amazing after I realized, theoretically, that I had a message from him in German, which was his native tongue. His grandfather was actually a Hessian desserter who fought in the Revolutionary War as a very young man, then married a woman of a Puritan family & settled in NY. So I'm thinking German was probably still spoken in the family at the time of his childhood. I felt like he somehow sent me that word as a thank you for the prayers I offered up at his graveside! I took French in high school & German in college, but never learned that word I'm certain. Plus, I'm horrible at languages and the fact that I mistook the s to be an f somewhat makes it less likely it was just a word I heard one time. It was a visual thing in my dream.

Fast forward to the latest, which I was truly surprised to see today.""Ook sein"" translated from German means ""be ok."" I have no recollection of dreaming it, but must've written it in my phone. I'm wondering if my uncle somehow knows I was in the hospital with A-fib back in October & was wishing me well? The actual thing I wrote down was ""ook sein pond"" which... I have no idea.

I'd love to hear what any of you think or if you've had similar experiences. I'm just going with my first intuition about the source of these words. Even after taking German, I know I never learned ""ook"" as a form of ""to be."" Totally new to me, maybe even a colloquialism? Thanks for your thoughts. 

Mrs. Ramsay/Pelatiah"
"The Old Family Hill","New York","Haunted Places","The story I'm submitting here was partially inspired by a recent poster who described the feelings of dread and anxiety, of being watched by something or someone unseen lurking in the shadows of a haunted home. It was also inspired by my recent trip home to see family, wherein the subject of family ghost stories inevitably arises. I realize there may be explanations for some of this, I concede that fact, but will share the story and let the reader decide. Of course I'm open to ideas, discussion and will entertain questions, as best I can. Please bear in mind, that I myself have never visited the property but heard plenty enough of what went on there.

The house or more accurately property in this story has been in my family for decades. The story goes back quite far, into the 1950's. I first heard the story from my grandmother and great aunt (father's side) when I used to stay with them. They would tell stories of bizarre events while I sat there listening, fascinated. It was these story telling sessions where I first heard the stories of the house on North Street. I believe it was partially from these story sessions where I became enthralled with ghost stories and started reading them.

The house and hill was owned by my great uncle. It was part of a farm of sorts and had no electricity. It's not that it wasn't available, it was just something my great uncle never bothered with.

 One night in the 50's (my dad and his siblings still quite young) my great uncle and his whole family showed up at the house on North Street visibly shaken. They seemed as if they had been terrorized and like (pardon the pun) they had seen a ghost. They asked my grandfather if they could stay the night on North Street and then asked if he would help them immediately relocate. They offered no explanation of what happened, just begging for help. The were clearly traumatized according to my grandmother. Of course, being family they were taken in for the night. My grandpa helped them move to a place a few miles further from their home. They would return to the house to retrieve only some clothes and personal possessions.

 My grandparents were only able to piece together what had happened in fragments. My great uncle and his family had just sat down to supper when something happened that scared them so bad, they fled the property that night, leaving all their furniture and even the hot dinner on the table. Other than going back for a few items as I mentioned, they never returned. They never talked about it to anyone, and my family tried for years to get them to speak about that night. My great uncle, like my grandfather (who scoffed at these ghost stories) was a no nonsense kind of man, not taken to flights of fancy (so I'm told). The family relocated a few miles away and tried to start over again. They never sold the house and property and it remains in the family all these decades later.

The house sat abandoned. In the 60's when my dad and uncle and their friends came of age, it became a place to hang out, kind of like a teen clubhouse. My dad and his friends would usually gather on North Street and hang out first. Their idea of fun was much tamer than today's generation (and even some back then) they got together and cooked up batches of french fries and ate and shot the breeze. At some point, they would drive up on the hill and hang out in the old house. One night they too fled the hill, never to return. They saw a bat on the house, but that wasn't what drove them away. My dad typically doesn't like to talk about these things, when asked about North Street, he kind of got short with me, saying he didn't remember. His response came too quickly though in my opinion. When I asked him about the hill, he said more to me. He told me, it wasn't what they saw that night, so much as what they felt. He described a feeling akin to terror and extreme anxiety that seemed to come from nowhere and everywhere at once and pursued them until they left the hill.

As the years went on, the house decayed and was left to vandals and thugs and things were stolen and graffiti left everywhere. My brother and his friends would visit for a thrill and to scare each other, but he admits there was something creepy about the place and even a few of his friends ran from the place. As my brother got older, he began to hunt on the land, but told me he always left before nightfall. He informed me the place changed at night, and as soon as the sun set, you felt as if you were being watched. You could never see anyone, but it was a heavy feeling that permeated the entire property, not just the house. The feeling inspired anxiety and fear but with no visible or audible source. To avoid it, he just left before it got dark. He said he wasn't the only one. Others with permission to hunt on the land described almost the same feeling and always after sunset.

It's possible of course that over the years, the stories handed down about the place could feed the fear factor and cause some of these encounters. However again, no one saw anything, it's only what they felt and the stories were consistent, even from people not familiar with the place. Also still there's the original event, an entire family that just up and flees from their home? My brother had encountered the older children who still tended the property and when he asked them about that night (the night they fled), they would quickly change the subject.

My brother told me an interesting story, that one of the adult kids of the original family had actually taken an interest in the old family property and lovingly restored it. The house was knocked down, the pond cleaned up and the acreage mowed. My brother told me this was kept up for some time and for awhile things simmered down. A person could be up there without the awful feelings and the property took on a more pleasant feel to it. Eventually one of the other kids though, started to let people hunt up there again and they tramped all over the place and it fell into disuse again. 

On my trip home, my brother and a close friend whom we grew up with gathered at my brothers house one night to hang out and catch up. My brother had purchased the house next door to my parents. It had once to belonged to an old couple we knew growing up and the old man had passed away years ago in the house. My brother had told me the old man still hangs around the place, apparently unable to move on. So that night as my brother and our neighbor/friend laid into a generous supply of beer while we reminisced, the focus of our conversations inevitably turned to ghost stories. My niece and her friend were upstairs playing games and filming dancing videos etc (and making quite a bit of noise) However as it got late, they came downstairs and became interested in what we were talking about. At first we discussed the old man at my brother's house. What was strange was my niece's friend suddenly said she saw the image of a hat, like the one on the couch. The hat she pointed at was a smaller version of a fedora, something more fashionable that kids wear. What she described though fit the description of an old fisherman's hat. It was what the old man frequently wore. How would she have know that? He died well before her time? Perhaps my brother or someone had mentioned it to her, but she didn't seem to know the stories about the old man and my brother probably wouldn't have been descriptive enough to mention the hat. Either way, we hadn't it mentioned prior on that evening so I know they couldn't have been listening from upstairs with the racket they were making.

 Regardless they wanted to hear the family stories and since they were 15 (about the age I had first heard them) I told them and my brother added his experiences. They listened intently and when we started to talk about the hill, my niece's friend stated she saw the color red for some reason. Again we didn't think too much about it, although in hindsight, I wonder if she had some psychic/intuitive senses? As my brother opened up about having some kind of visions on the property (he didn't elaborate on what) that accompanied the feelings of anxiety, he informed us that the house was red (before it was knocked down) I didn't even know that? When we started about North Street, my niece's friend said she saw the color blue. That was the color of the place on North Street. How would she have known that? Neither my niece or her friend knew about the place, in fact my brother and I drove them by North Street the next day and pointed it out for the first time.

What was interesting was that as my brother and our friend became quite inebriated, they suddenly had the brilliant idea to have me drive them up on the hill to experience the bizarre feelings up there first hand. I was the only sober one besides my niece and her friend. This was about 3AM now. I of course knew this was an extremely BAD idea. My brother and our friend had false courage thanks to the alcohol and wanted a thrill. I informed them both in no uncertain terms would they get me within a hundred miles of that place, especially at night. (I was being sarcastic as the place in question was only 10-15 minutes away, but they got the point) Of course they pursued the matter. What was strange was the no nonsense way I spoke about it. Although the place did freak me out, I wasn't scared at that moment. I just informed them that what was up there on the hill, didn't want to be disturbed and it would be a bad experience for both of them. As for myself, I already believed in the afterlife, I didn't need a direct experience, and certainly not one of that caliber. I was talking with a sense of wisdom and knowledge I didn't know I had. It's as if it was coming from somewhere else? No, it wasn't possession, I clearly remember everything and I hadn't been drinking. It's just as if I suddenly understood more about the hill than I should have if it makes sense?

 What's even stranger was that my niece's friend suddenly began also speaking in a no nonsense way. She told my brother that ""He"" didn't want to be disturbed. ""He"" still considered it 'his' property and didn't like intruders. She didn't speak in a panicked sense, but almost with a passion as it were, like some truth needed to be told if that makes sense? What's even more bizarre, was that I accepted what she said without question, as if on some level I knew it was the truth? I thought there was more than one spirit up there though, and when I asked about 'him' she said she saw him as an older man, like a farmer, but couldn't tell me where this was all coming from? Being younger, maybe she was more open?

I have no explanation for this sudden bout of wisdom and where it came from, for either of us. Perhaps it was a guide or guardian angel or maybe whatever entities that haunted the hill, sensing my brother's intention and trying to put a stop to any shenanigans before they started? I realized afterwards that typically before regaling in the telling of any ghost stories, I protect myself and take the proper safeguards, but this time in my excitement, I neglected to shield myself. Either way, as I continued to talk them both down, they reached that point prior to passing out, so after instructing my niece to hide the keys to the truck and satisfying myself they weren't going anywhere, I went to bed. It would be dawn in only a couple more hours.

Despite everything else, I intuitively knew it was a bad idea to go up on the hill, especially when the two of them had been drinking. I believe it makes people more susceptible to ghosts and encounters. When drunk, a person is more vulnerable and their guard is down. I've known psychics who state drinking punches holes in a person's aura and energy field and I can only imagine if they're sensitive it's much worse. It always amazes me that people disregard a person's ghost story if they're under the influence, because, their senses cannot be trusted. We don't always 'see' ghosts with our physical senses though. In this case and other stories, people can't see the spirit or hear it, but they feel it. They don't physically feel it, but we sense it with something beyond out 5 physical senses. We know it's there. When drunk, the filters a person has to not seeing or experiencing the supernatural are also down, making them more likely to encounter something. I'm not suggesting that we believe everyone who has encountered a ghost while drinking etc, and it should be readily believed. We still need to do our due diligence there, but it does need to be considered that a person could encounter something not of this world more readily in that state than a sober one. It's another perspective.

That being said, the only other thing I can offer is what little I know of the history of the property. Not much is known, Indians frequented the area, (I'm not suggesting such a cliche such as a burial mound) but there were skirmishes in settler times. A fort was burned nearby and the whole area used to be hideout for renegades, pirates, and outlaws, because it was so far out of the way back in pioneering days. I don't know what could have caused the so called haunting any more than what drove the family off the hill that night so long ago, but I thought I would share the story!"
"The Creepy Yellow House On North Main Street","Massachusetts","Haunted Places","I have experienced many events I believe to be paranormal throughout my life, and I hesitated to write about this one because my memories of this house are very dark. I have tried to block them out over the years, but I am unable to because I have such vivid memories of this house and my experiences inside of it. I have not been inside this house in 18 years, when it was rented by the family of a close friend of mine from elementary school, who we will call Tim. Tim lived in this house with his family for 2 years, and I was a frequent visitor. When my parents were divorced and my mother was forced to work full time, Tim's mother often watched me during the day in the summer of 2004, right around the time they moved in. 

The first time I visited Tim in the house was actually in December 2003, the year he had moved in, when he had invited me to sleep over his house. I remember that day very well. A huge snowstorm had just passed and left inches of thick, white snow across my state. When we pulled up in front of Tim's house, I was immediately struck by the sensation that there was something ""off"" about the house. It was a two-story Cape Cod style house, painted a sickly mustard yellow, with a non-enclosed, cement porch on the side of the house with two doors directly side by side, one leading into the living room and the other into the kitchen which were located back to back in the house. The house was built around 1950, and was not that old but it felt old to me at the time. As I walked up to the front door with my mom and rang the bell, and stepped into the house, I would soon understand just how deep that feeling of trepidation was.

The second you stepped through the front door you were immediately overcome with this oppressive heaviness, this intense negative energy that followed you everywhere. It did not start out feeling like someone was following or watching you, that came later... But it was a terrible feeling that was unshakable.

 The inside of the house was one sickly color or nauseating scent bleeding into another. Walking in the front door, right in front were stairs carpeted in the same sickly mustard color as the outside. The living room was to the left, a dark, dreary room with cream colored walls, gradually blackened by years of cigarette smoke. The living room connected with the kitchen in the back of the house, located directly behind it. 

This kitchen was painted a sickly lime green which reminded me of the color of vomit, and connected to the kitchen and running behind the stairs and around the corner was a dark hallway which contained a bathroom, office room, and the parents' bedroom. 

Every door in the house had framing that was dark brown and mismatched the color of the walls. 

But nothing struck me more than the smell in the house. Not just the smell of cigarette which permeated the entire space, but this was different. The smell was a moldy, earthy, wet smell that, during all the times I had been in the house, made the idea of eating nearly impossible, it was enough to rid you of your appetite. The smell upstairs was even worse, and was noticeable the second you began climbing the stairs. I have no idea what it was nor how to even describe it, but it permeated every space upstairs and felt like it was emanating from the depths of the house. It was a sharper moldy smell that made you feel like you needed to sneeze. While these smells were likely not paranormal, they certainly contributed to the unshakable feeling of ""wrongness"" in the house. And it would only get worse.

That night, Tim and I had been playing in the snow and had come back inside while his parents were watching a movie in their room. I remember us walking into the dark kitchen and seeing an old cuckoo clock on the wall, and feeling like the second I stepped into the kitchen from outside, there was something glaring at me from the back hallway. I could not see anything but when I looked down the hallway I got this intense headache and felt dizzy. I tried not to think about it the rest of the evening but I felt deeply uncomfortable. 

I remember little else about that particular evening other than being afraid, for no reason obvious to me, of the downstairs hallway all night long. It just had this oppressive feeling, like when you stood in the kitchen looking down the hallway or sat on the living room sofa and could see into the hallway, that it was full of negative energy. Tim had a dog which refused to go down that hallway and would always stop at the beginning of it, right near where the basement door was, and would just stand there. Nothing could entice him into the hallway, and this bothered Tim's parents, because their room was at the end of the hallway and they hoped the dog would go into their room. It never did. And that smell downstairs was strongest in the hallway, seemingly emerging from the basement.

The next summer, I spent a lot of time in the house when Tim's mother would babysit me regularly when my mother was working. This is when the actual experiences began.

 One day I was sitting in the kitchen at the table with Tim's mother and little sister, Jennifer, who must have been around 6 at the time. She turns to her mother and out of nowhere says ""Mommy, I don't want to live here anymore."" Her mother asked her why, and her answer terrified me. She said ""Mom, there is a shadow in the house, I see it all the time. It scares me, Mommy. I just saw it over there"" and she pointed toward the hallway. My heart began racing and I turned and looked down the hallway. Immediately, every hair on my body stood on end and I felt this heavy wave of resistance on my entire body. The hallway looked so dark and foreboding. I felt a presence in the hallway but could not see anything, but I knew there was something there. Their mother got up, walked around the corner and said ""See, sweetie, there is nothing here!"" and sat back down at the table. 

But the house did have a shadow and I began seeing it myself. One night, I stayed over and was sleeping on the downstairs sofa, facing toward the door to the kitchen with full visibility into the creepy hallway. I remember waking up for no reason and it was pitch black out, but I could see just enough to know where things were located. Suddenly, I see a dark shadow glide from the kitchen down the hallway and into the bathroom, and shortly after, the dog (which had been sleeping on the kitchen floor apparently) stood at the start of the hallway and began growling aggressively, then slowly backing away back into the kitchen. This absolutely terrified me. I covered my head with the covers and struggled to get to sleep the rest of the night. The only bathroom in the house was located in that hallway and I refused to go to the bathroom all night even when I needed to, and thankfully was able to make it until morning. 

There would be other times in the house when I would be sitting in the living room, the kitchen, in one of the upstairs rooms, anywhere and I would see movement out of the corner of my eye, with a dark flash just going by and then disappearing. Other times, I would actually see the shadow gliding out of one room and into another, or right past a person who had their back turned to it. By now, everyone had just tried to pretend they did not see it and would not speak of it, but everyone knew it was there. It did not have a face or a particular form but was of human height, just a partially see-through mass of darkness that glided around. I tried not to stare at it and I certainly never followed it, but it would appear at random times and then disappear. I always wonder where its ""lair"" was, where it was when we didn't see it, so I could avoid that place. 

Another time, I woke up to the blasting screech of the smoke detector, followed by Tim's father running out of the bedroom from the hallway, into every room in the house to make sure there was no fire. He shouted from upstairs that there was no fire, and then ran into the basement to check down there. Nervously I followed him to the top of the stairs and stared down them. The basement stairs appeared to descend into complete darkness, with cobwebs everywhere and that stench of rotting wood. He shouted that there was no fire, but he could not get the sound of the smoke detector to stop. He unscrewed them all from the ceiling and put them down on the countertop and it finally stopped. That experience shook me. 

Other unnerving experiences plagued me throughout that summer. One time, a group of our friends were at the house having gone to a local water park, and came back and were changing into our regular clothes. I was in the bathroom changing and my friends were outside in the hallway waiting for it to be their turn to change. The door was locked, and I could hear everyone talking, when all of a sudden the door just swung wide open. The knob did not turn, there was no attempt to push the door open, it just swung open, as if it had never been fully closed. I immediately grabbed a towel and covered myself with it and everyone just stood there shocked. No one knew what happened. Another time, I got locked in that bathroom and could not get out, which made no sense because the door locked from the inside. But the knob would not turn and I could not get the door open. Eventually, it just released itself and I got out. 

This other time, I slept over and woke up in the morning not knowing what time it was. Normally by this time people were up and awake but this time, not a sound. I went upstairs and Tim was not in his bed, and I knew that his sister was going to be at a friend's house that day. 

I went back downstairs and sat on the sofa when I heard a noise in the bedroom that sounded like movement in Tim's parent's bedroom. I saw in the kitchen that it was 10:00 AM. I breathed a big sigh and forced myself to go down the dark, foreboding hallway and knocked on the parents' door. I could hear movement that sounded like the closet door opening and closing, dresser drawers opening and closing, people whispering but I could not hear what they were saying. I knocked on the door and suddenly all the sound stopped, and then I heard the kitchen door open. Tim and his parents came into the kitchen and said ""Oh, you finally woke up. We did not want to wake you, you were so fast asleep!"" I immediately shouted that someone was in their room! Tim's father pushed past me, opened the door, and sure enough, no one was in there and nothing out of place. So creepy. 

Another event that puzzled me and freaked me out was that when we celebrated Tim's sister Jennifer's birthday was that she could not blow the candles out on the cake. They were not those prank candles that no matter how many times you try you just cannot blow them out, so when she struggled to blow out the candles and kept blowing but they just would not go out, everyone was shocked. The final time she tried, they almost entirely blew out, but then the flame came back full force, as if just lit, and then suddenly went out all at once. This was very unsettling. Soon after, both siblings began to have nightmares about the house catching on fire. Tim recalled one nightmare where he was in the living room and unable to get out because the fire was engulfing the room and blocking all exits, and when he turned to run out the curiously placed side door which led to the porch, it was not there!

They moved out of the house later that year and over time, Tim and I grew apart. I have not spoken to him in many, many years, but I have driven by the house and every time I do, I get the same shivery feeling all over again. I do not know what had happened there, and I did not piece this together as a child but looking back now I suspect it had something to do with fire, because multiple events (strange placement of doors from the porch with one likely added later, the smoke alarm, the candles, the nightmares about fire) pointed in that direction."
"1750s Horror Home In Historic Massachusetts 2","Massachusetts","Haunted Places","Several years ago, I had posted an account of my experiences in my stepbrother's childhood home, titled similarly to this one. My stepbrother is visiting for the holidays and it led us to recount our experiences in this home. I also found photos of the inside of the home, which I can share if anyone would like to see them, from a real estate listing.

To recap: the home was built in 1750, and is located in the historic seaside village in Massachusetts where I grew up. Other than my stepdad, who lived in the home with his family for nearly 10 years prior to his divorce, families have come and gone. The house has been for sale twice in the last 5 years, and never seems to be able to maintain occupancy, despite having undergone renovations. I question if this is due to the presence of other elements in the home. From the moment I stepped foot in this home as a child, I was immediately met with the sensation that the house was haunted, and I felt deeply uncomfortable being left alone in the oldest part of the home, especially upstairs. It constantly felt as if no matter where you went, there was something glaring at you or ready to jump out at you every time you entered a different room or turned the corner. I was always on high alert due to this unwavering sensation, and for the longest time, everyone had told me that I was the only person who experienced these feelings.

It turns out that is not the case, and my stepbrother and his friends, many of whom I also knew from childhood, experienced them as well. From the backyard of the house looking up at it, my stepbrother always felt, especially at night, as if there was an unseen entity in one of the upstairs windows staring at him, and he felt a constant compulsion to look up at that window as he was walking through the back door of the home. This window corresponded to the upstairs hallway, which I was deathly afraid of as a child and where I felt that the majority of the activity in the home was concentrated. I also just found out that the majority of his friends refused to be left alone upstairs in the house, openly stating they believed the house was haunted and that they would get this sensation that when they were upstairs alone, there was an entity right beside them, and although they could not see it, they could not shake the sensation that it was there. I felt this too. It was the feeling you have when you are in a room with another person, you are looking in a different direction but you know that if you look up, there will be someone there. Only there never was anything there. Sometimes, it felt as if there was someone or something inches away from your face, and even closing your eyes you would still ""feel"" it, with that pressure feeling in your forehead near your eyes when something is in front of your face.

I knew that my stepbrother had, at some point, moved from his room upstairs to the downstairs room in the back of the house which was part of a more recent addition, and that he did this because he believed the upstairs was haunted. But he never explained exactly what he had experienced until now. He told me that while the upstairs especially felt as if he was being watched and surrounded by unseen entities, nothing was so jarring to him until one night when he was lying in bed and was having difficulty sleeping. He had the persistent feeling of being watched which never really left you while in the home, but right when he closed his eyes and was about to fall asleep, he heard the sound of a door creak open, followed by footsteps down the upstairs hallway. He thought it was his father, so he closed his eyes and tried to go to sleep. Suddenly, the footsteps stopped right in front of the door to his room, he heard his doorknob turn, and the door to his own room start to slowly creak open. He closed his eyes and pulled his blanket over his head, waiting anxiously for someone to enter the room but there was no sound of footsteps. He lifted his head from under the blanket and saw the door wide open, but he could not see anyone or anything, only the stairs in the dim night light. All of a sudden, he felt this immediate sensation that someone, or something, was right next to his face. The temperature seemed to drop almost instantly. He swung his arms around on all sides and frantically began looking around but he could not see anything there. After what felt like an eternity and that sensation not going away, he screamed for his father, who ran into the room and convinced him it was all a bad dream and to go back to bed. The next day he moved downstairs, and only went upstairs when absolutely necessary for the remainder of time that he lived in that home. 

There were many experiences I remember that I did not connect to paranormal activity until now.

One was that my stepdad's ex wife used to have this locked cabinet full of antique dolls, dishes, and plates which was in the dining room at the foot of the stairs. This cabinet was locked, and she and my stepdad were the only ones with access to the key. They made a big deal of this, because every item in the cabinet was antique and expensive. One day, I remember my stepdad went into the cabinet to remove one of the antique dolls with the intention of selling it to a collector and while doing so found that one of the plates, among the largest, most antique, and worth the most money, was broken. It was cracked almost all the way down the middle, but not enough for it to shatter. When he took the plate out to inspect it and try to ascertain the cause of the damage, it split in half right in his hand. There was no explanation for this, and no one had been in that cabinet for months. Moreover, the plate was located centrally in the cabinet and easily visible, and no one had heard or seen any indication that it was broken before this. 

Another experience was when I was watching a movie with my stepbrother in the downstairs office room in the older part of the house. The sofa was against the wall and there was a window directly behind the sofa, and I always felt that there was someone, or something, watching me from outside the home, but I could not see anything. I would feel the need to lie down in just a way that I felt if something was watching me from outside, it would not see me because of the angling of the sofa. This feeling was persistent and jarring and prevented me from being able to focus on the movie. It created this prickly feeling on the back of my neck and caused my heart to race. Combined with the feeling that there were entities surrounding me within the house, staring at me from around every corner and from behind every door, from above and from below, this feeling was unshakable. 

In the last year of their ownership of the home, they adopted a cat. I remember seeing this next event happen. The cat would refuse to go in specific rooms of the house and never went upstairs. One day I was watching a movie with my stepbrother in the same room as just mentioned. In the corner of the room was a table covered in a table cloth, with pictures and other memorabilia on it. The cat had crawled under the table cloth and was under the table, as cats often do, and suddenly started hissing and letting out aggressive meows. This startled us all because we thought there might be a mouse or some other animal that had gotten in through the ventilation. The cat ran out from under the table with its tail swinging back and forth and darted out of the room. I searched under the table to see what was underneath, almost expecting something to be there, but there was nothing. No sign of any animal activity, no ventilation system where something could have gotten through. The cat never went back into that room again and to this day it remains a complete mystery as to what he saw under the table. 

The final experience I remember that I had not originally attributed to the paranormal was that in the creepy upstairs hallway, was a small door which was about 4 feet in height which led into a crawl space which was used for storage. I NEVER went in there nor would I imagine doing so, but my stepdad mentioned that one of the last weeks they lived in the house, he attempted to open this door to get items out of the crawlspace as they were packing, but the door just would not open. The knob would turn, but he could not push the door open, as if someone on the other side was pressing their weight against the door to keep it wedged shut. This crawl space was connected to another from another upstairs room, so he crawled around in the space and accessed the door from the other side. There was nothing blocking it, he was able to open it from the other side, and has no understanding of why it should have been wedged shut.

My stepdad refuses to believe this house was haunted. One day he sat in his upstairs room asking any spirits to reveal themselves, but nothing did. But even he admits that he would get that creepy feeling on the back of his neck where every hair stood on end and he felt as if he was being watched, but he writes it off as social conditioning. The house was 250 years old and looked haunted, so why would it not be? But the rest of us still believe."
"What Lies Beneath","Georgia","Haunted Places","When my child began in a new soccer club a couple years ago, we practiced & played at a new field, Braly Park in Paulding Co., Georgia. The route from our house in the exurbs of Atlanta takes us through a location that's seen multiple historic events, which led me to revisit a terrible news event from my high school years (1977) as well as something I discovered last evening that has me wondering if I had a paranormal experience or if I'm just imagining. 

On the way to soccer, we pass New Hope Church, just one of the many Civil War battlefields & skirmish sites that mark the area around the northwest ATL suburbs & exurbs. New Hope was a heavily wooded area where 16, 000 Union troops engaged 4,000 Confederates on May 25, 1864. Just over 2000 men died there, with the Union losing 1,665 of them. It was a rebel victory that day in spite of the Yankee's huge advantage in numbers. 

Presently, there is a Civil War-era cemetery across from the church with gas stations, drug store & a typical Publix (grocery store) strip shopping center very nearby. The church is standing and operational, very pretty, but despite my awareness of the battle in NAME, I never realized I was passing through the actual battle site on my way to soccer practice until I'd been doing it for many months. About that time, my daughter got her learner's license, so I was able to sit in the passenger seat. That meant when she stopped at the traffic light by the cemetery I now had time to study it a bit. It was and is quite foreboding to me. The thought of walking around in it is not positive... However I did take some pictures out the car window, and the very first time got some obvious orbs. The feeling that this location carries a lot of spiritual energy has grown stronger for me with time, but I can't put my finger on why.

Initially, my interest was completely on the battle site. One day I was researching what happened there online and hit on a HUGE discovery: New Hope is ALSO where a terrible and historic passenger jet crash happened back in 1977 -- a tragedy I remembered vividly from my high school days! Almost exactly in the same place, just north of the cemetery & church, a Southern Airways dc-9 that had come through a terrible storm lost both engines and tried to land on the then-rural two lane road. Seventy two people were killed! How could I be driving there 3-4 days a week and not have known! But then, the information seemed to validate the strangeness of the area. 

Then last fall, Sept. 11, sitting at a soccer game, I kept thinking about the crash for some strange reason. I was compelled to look it up on my phone, which I never do while watching the games. I Googled the crash and the first story that came up said... The wreckage of the plane was eventually taken to the local dump... Which was now -- 40 years later -- filled in & converted to a SOCCER PARK! Our park! The plane's fuselage was under our playing fields!

That was a surprise. 

So last week, while waiting for practice, I walked around the perimeter of the park for a little exercise the way I have in the past and kept thinking about that plane or what was left of it. I took some video of a particularly intriguing pathway. The sun was going down. I also accidentally pushed the video button while walking, but never realized until last evening when I sat down to review. I'm pretty sure there are no visual signs of spirits in any of the images, but I spent a lot of time looking last night. Two things sort of freaked me out. First, on the short video where I'm walking and didn't realize I hit ""video start"" you can hear sounds but my hand is over the camera. There comes a point that sounds a lot like an airplane getting VERY loud with voices, which then stops & goes back to normal sounds. I KNOW that was NOT among the sounds I heard while walking. I could hear the soccer sounds softly in the distance but up close noises were the frogs in a drainage ditch and one or two cars driving by in the parking lot (that sound NOTHING like airplane sounds). Listening last night with my earphones in, the loud sounds gave me chills on my entire body when I realized what they might be.

In the second short clip, there is a visual of a path, nothing unusual. Soccer sounds as I pan my phone around. But then there is a woman's whisper, quite close, saying, ""It's this way, THIS way."" As if she knew I was wondering about the location of what lies beneath. 

I've just listened to it another 20 times and it's unmistakable. It's not my first EVP... 

My questions to you all: do you think an I-phone can pick up the sounds of a plane that crashed 40 years ago if I was perhaps walking above where it was buried? I tried to be careful and noted all the sounds around me as I recorded. Almost positive there weren't any airplane sounds though, it was a very quiet evening. Also, can a spirit know what you are thinking? Why was she saying, ""This way...""? I'm 100 percent certain no live person was there whispering to me.

Quick note: I've submitted some stories under the name Mrs. Ramsay previously. Computer changes caused me to have to choose a new name and rejoin the site. Will appreciate your thoughts."
"Angel, Or Something Else?","Massachusetts","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","Back in the early 1990s angels were all the rage. You couldn't go into a store without finding a stand on the counter with guardian angel pins. Everyone wore them on their jackets. In fact, I still have one attached to an old sweater. At the time, there were many books out about angels and some of these books contained stories of people who had experiences with them.

I was given a book about how to contact an angel. In hindsight, this was not a good idea. What I contacted was most likely not anything odd. 

 However, this seem like a neat thing to do at the time. I was in my early 20s and just happen to be home alone. Not sure where my boyfriend or roommates were but this seem like a good time to try this. I don't recall 100% what the instructions were but I remember there was some type of incantation you had to recite. I had a notebook in my lap and a pen ready, based on the instructions in the book. I started the incantation and waited...nothing. Suddenly thoughts started coming into my head and I started writing them down. Now, I don't know for sure if this was my mind making this stuff up but the sentences were rhyming! I asked the angel its name and was given a response.

Moments later the energy in the room shifted. I started to feel overwhelmed, like something very large was in the room with me. At the time I had an oak dresser and the wood started making popping sounds. I started to see a gold glittering as if someone was dropping glitter from the ceiling. Instead of feeling some sense of peace, I was terrified! I begged whatever it was to go away because it was scaring me. I had the master bedroom at the time and entered the bathroom right off of it. I stood in front of the sink with my eyes closed and continued to beg for whatever was there to go.

Without warning I felt something cold touch the center of my back, right between the shoulder blades. Then it was gone. The room returned to normal and I didn't see or hear anything out of the ordinary. I took a big breath of relief. My back still felt cold so I lifted my shirt up and was horrified to see a large purple oval in the center of my back. It didn't hurt. It just looked like a giant purple bruise. Needless to say, I was feeling quite unsettled for some time to come. I never tried to summon an angel (or anything for that matter) again and eventually got rid of the book. 

So, what was really there? Was it an angel, ghost, demon? I will never know for sure. Later on in the day I told my boyfriend at the time what had happened. I mentioned the mark on my back. When I went to show him, of course it was gone."
"The Ghost In My Basement Tried To Speak To Me","New York","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","Hey there folks! I keep meaning to post more of my experiences to this site. I just didn't expect to be posting experience I had last night. Then again, I didn't expect to HAVE an experience last night.

If you've read my profile, then you know that my area has A LOT of history. So it's a no brainier that my house is haunted. But what you don't know is that my house gets even MORE active when there are renovations being done. Well a few weeks ago, our toilet leaked and rotted out the floor underneath. It was so bad, that we were told the bathroom would pretty much have to be gutted, and the floor taken all the way down to the studs and replaced.

I knew the second I heard that, that I was going to have encounters while our bathroom was being rebuilt. I just did expect things to get stirred up before demo even began.

Last night I was up late getting my lunch and everything ready for the coming work day. I went down to the basement to switch a load of laundry from the washer over to the dryer. It was late and I was tired but I wanted it done. I'm not kidding, it was like 2 in the morning when I was doing this. Because I decided to be silly and fell asleep in a Livingroom chair. So down I went.

I was listening to music while I was down there. Something that I always do. The entire time I was down there I felt like someone was standing so close to me I would run into them if I turned around. The entire time I was down there, the air felt really heavy. Like something didn't want me down there. I finished switching laundry around and went to go back upstairs. I paused in front of the stairs just long enough to set a timer. While I was standing there, I felt like something was standing right next to me. I heard something say ""who?"" Near me. To say I sprinted up the stairs and closed the door behind me is an understatement. I felt like something was chasing me. The hair on the back of my neck went up, and chills went down my spine.

I finished the rest of my chores as quickly as possible, before racing up to my bedroom as quickly and quietly as possible. I felt like there was something right behind me the entire time.

This all went down before the bathroom renovation started. I have at least a week to go before the work is done. Wish me luck."
"Possible Demon","Texas","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","It's been about 30 years ago, when I was 13, but I remember this story like it was yesterday. I was a somewhat rebellious teenager and had always been interested in the supernatural. In addition to doing ""typical"" rebellious teenage things like sneaking out, skipping class, etc I also started listening to heavy metal music and still do. The difference at that point in my life is that I started getting deeper and deeper into devil worshiping music, NOT Satanic. I was raised as a Christian and still attended church on most Sundays due to my parents ""forcing"" me to go. I never believed that much which is part of the reason I think I started going down the path I took.

The more I listened to these bands and lyrics the more fascinated I became with the occult, specifically devil worship. Being the dumb and naive kid I was, I began ""praying"" to Satan. I had no idea what I was doing, I would just close my eyes and pray to him. I would ask for things that were on the more sinister side, which I won't discuss, and I would ask for him to reveal himself to me or show me a sign that he could ""hear"" me.

Over the course of a few months I literally began to feel myself change mentally. I began having more and more evil thoughts and I started fighting with my parents (who were great parents) more often. I knew I wasn't my normal self but I also justified everything in my head to normalize my thoughts and actions. The more evil I felt, the harder and more often I prayed to Satan until one night and morning changed me to this day.

It was a school night so I said my normal nighttime ""prayers"" before going to bed. Sometime around 2-3 a.m I awoke from a deep sleep. I wasn't having any nightmares or dreaming, I just suddenly woke up with a strong feeling that something or someone was watching me. It wasn't a good feeling in the slightest bit, whatever it was felt evil and malicious. I didn't feel any temperature changes and didn't hear a thing, it was just a feeling. I was in bed, facing the wall so my back was turned towards my bedroom door. I was scared but I had to look to hopefully calm myself down and realize it was all in my head. I slowly rolled over and standing in my doorway was the silhouette of a man wearing a suit and a fedora type hat holding a briefcase. Although I couldn't see his facial features clearly I could vaguely see the outline of a neatly trimmed beard as well. Based on my doorway, I would estimate he was 5'10 or so. He just stood there staring at me so I rolled over and closed my eyes, scared to death but I still felt his presence.

I wasn't dreaming and I never went to sleep for the rest of the night. Hours later I finally rolled back over and he was gone but the door was still open. Since it was a school day, I needed to take a shower which was downstairs. I was still so scared about what I may see around every corner that I literally ran to the shower and went as fast as I could. As hard as I tried, I could never even close my eyes because I was afraid of seeing him again and I was afraid of what I might see after opening them.

I ran back up stairs to my brother's room, who slept across the hall from me, and wouldn't leave his side which was extremely unusual for me. I asked him if he heard anything that night or ever got up for any reason and he denied it, I could tell he wasn't lying. He began to know something wasn't right with me based on my actions, questions and probably how I looked. I can't remember what I said when he asked what was wrong but it wasn't the truth.

My brother had recently got his license and we went to the same school so he drove me every morning. As we headed to school, about a 30 minute drive through all urban areas such as neighborhoods, strip malls, etc I just looked straight ahead. Like in the house and shower, I was afraid to look anywhere else but what was right in front of me. At some point we reached a red light, and like in bed, I had that same feeling that I was being watched. Once again, I had to look to hopefully give myself comfort that it was all in my head but boy was I wrong. 

It still creeps me out as I type this but standing there on the corner, about 15-20 feet from my window, was a ""man"" wearing a dark grey suit with a fedora type hat and closely shaved beard while holding a briefcase staring right at me! I almost had a heart attack and whipped my head around to look straight ahead again. Seeing ""him"" literally took my breath away like someone just hit me in the stomach. My brother was obviously oblivious to all of this and listening to the radio loud enough that he probably never heard me gasp. As we drove off, I kept my head straight but shifted my eyes to the passenger side mirror and I could still see him standing there as he slowly turned his head and never took his eyes off the car until we were out of sight.

I was a mess all day, I couldn't concentrate and didn't even want to go home but when we got home later that day I asked my dad if he ever got up that night for any reason, specifically to check on me and he said no. He has also never owned nor has he worn a fedora hat and I always slept with my door locked. My parents had no idea I had occasionally snuck out at this point so they had no reason to check on me either. Needless to say, I immediately stopped praying to Satan and even started praying to God although I wasn't a big believer in either. I also stopped listening to the same music although ironically I still listen to some of it to this day but I took a long break, lol. After another month or so, I eventually started feeling ""normal"" again and even my parents commented about how different I seemed during those months I described above.

To this day, I don't know what to think. I'm agnostic for the most part but atheist every other day, lol. If it weren't for this story, and a few others I'll share, I would be 100% agnostic but whatever ""that"" was, was pure evil and I don't think it's a coincidence that I invited it into my life. Part of me wants to blow it off 30 years later and say it was all in my head but it happened exactly how I described it and it wasn't a dream. Even if I rationalize that it was a dream, that doesn't explain the unlocked door or the ""man"" on the street. There's too many things that happened for me to think it wasn't real.

Thanks to anyone who read this. Any thoughts or ideas are welcome even if I disagree;)"
"A Ghost In A Hurry","Illinois","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I have been meaning to write about the following incidents for several years, but for one reason or another, kept putting it off. This took place in (I believe) 2018. As part of my job in pet care, I regularly spend long periods of time at customer's houses when they are out of town. This particular house was built in the 1940s and in the 90s had an extension added. Several paranormal incidents happened there over the years. Once, while my wife and I were sitting in the den, which is part of the newer extension, discussing the possibility of the house being haunted, several of the ceiling lights in the vaulted ceiling began dimming and then getting very bright (they had individual brightness control knobs) while a chandelier and three lamps began flicking on and off. Meanwhile the lights in the kitchen remained on without disturbance. This weird light show went on for twenty or so seconds before returning to normal. The fact that it was multiple lights, seemingly acting independently, suggests it was paranormal. I have stayed in this house many times since and nothing unusual with the lights has ever happened again.

On another occasion when my wife was staying alone in the house overnight, she awoke to hear what sounded like two male voices in conversation coming from the space between the bedroom and bathroom door. As often seems to be the case with paranormal voices, although distinct, what was being said was unclear. Suffice it to say, there was nobody visible there. Within two months of this incident, my brother (who was working for me at the time) was heading toward the mud room at the rear of the house to leave, when he saw two figures standing and facing each other in front of the door. He described them as appearing like a photographic negative. They were there and within a couple of seconds were gone.

The most dramatic incident was when I happened to be alone one morning. I was getting dressed in the master bedroom on the main floor (it's a two-story house) when a loud rainstorm caught my attention. The rain was lashing loudly against the windows, and I glanced at the half open door to see a woman quickly walking from the entry foyer to the left and turning left to head down a short hallway to the kitchen. I knew what I was witnessing was an apparition as the woman, who was wearing what appeared to be light, shin length dress and had hair falling past her shoulders, was monochromatic. She seemed comprised of a washed out white and was clearly focused on some objective as she hurried past. I immediately followed this figure into the kitchen and, not surprisingly, found it empty. I remember feeling quite elated at seeing the apparition and immediately called my wife to tell her what I'd seen. I sensed that what I was seeing was just a replay of something that happened long ago. Her dress struck me as something that could've been from anytime between the 1940s to the 1960s. 

I find it interesting that the apparition appeared immediately after the rainstorm started. The often-reported connection between paranormal occurrences and water possibly at play. Several months after seeing this apparition, the house had extensive renovations done. I remember talking with one of the workers and he told me he had pulled out a huge amount of outdated clothing from the walls of the attic that had apparently been used as insulation. Maybe some of the paranormal activity was connected to these clothes because since the renovations I have never sensed or experienced anything else at the house that could be considered paranormal."
"Haunting In Midwest City","Oklahoma","Haunted Places","In the 70's I was a professional musician and toured a lot in Texas, There were times I was away from home weeks at a time.

During these gigs I was playing my girlfriend was cheating on me and I decided to move out of the house we shared together.

I moved in with a childhood friend who had a house waiting for him when he returned from his stint in the Marines after his second tour in Viet Nam.

He had a two bedroom house and I didn't have any bedroom furniture, so until I managed to at least get a bed to sleep in I slept on the couch.

The arrangement was perfect! I worked days & my friend worked nights and the only time we saw each other was during the weekends.

I noticed that just about the time I would start to doze off I would hear one of the latches to one of the bedroom doors click. This was an older home with solid wooden doors and to fully close them you had to push them to and you would hear the latch click. This went on for weeks!

This house had a floor furnace located just a few feet away from where the couch was located and eventually after hearing the bedroom door latch click I would hear a sound that sounded like someone had just stepped on the grating for the floor furnace.

One weekend when my roommate was at home I asked him if he had experienced any weird things happening in the house. He looked at me with his eyes wide open and asked me ""Why?"".

I told him what had been happening to me at night when he was at work.

He told me that one night he had been asleep and heard his keys jingling. We had a double cylinder dead-bolt lock on the front door and we would leave our keys in the lock at night. He got out of bed to check it out and his keys were swinging in the lock and there wasn't anyone outside the door to cause that to happen.

We were both smokers and used Zippo lighters. He mentioned that he started hearing the clicking sound of a Zippo lighter being opened/closed.

One day he went shopping for groceries and when he walked into the kitchen to put things away all the cabinet doors were open!

Eventually we both started hearing the same sound when we were both at home.

Jokingly we named our ghost ""George"" and whenever we would hear the clicking sound we'd say ""OK George... Knock it off"".

Later on he decided to move his girlfriend in and I had to relocate. She too had started hearing ""George"" around the house.

She eventually put an old family bible she had on the living room table and he told me that everything came to a halt. No more ""George"".

My friend passed away last year and his home is up for sale. I've been tempted to ask the new home owner if they have experienced any strange things happening at the house. So far the house has remained unsold."
"Stranger In The Campsite","Arizona","Haunted Places","In May of this year I lost my partner to a horrible accident while camping. His gun went off and accidentally shot him while we were sleeping. It was the worst day of my life. Friends have asked how I could stand to stay in the camper after what happened. My answer is that it was always meant as a place for rest and relaxation. I would be letting tragedy win if I did not keep it. While I am sad for the loss of such an incredible man, being in the place where he took his last breath brings me peace. I know he would still want me to take solace there. 

As part of my healing, I decided to take the camper to a quiet area 90 minutes north of Phoenix. I found a beautiful quiet spot with gorgeous views of Sedona and Flagstaff. There are a lot of people who live the vagabond life there or are retirees. It is a very tempting full time lifestyle, to say the least. 

I quickly met a woman about my age who lived in the campsite next to mine. She informed me that the two ladies who lived in the campsite behind me, would be back that Saturday evening from visiting relatives in California. Once evening came, I settled into my bed for the first time since my partner died. My bedroom is at the rear of the camper and has a good size window over the bed. My dog was asleep next to me. At some point in the evening I fell asleep and was awoken by the crunching of tires on gravel. The two ladies behind me who I hadn't met yet had arrived home. My dog sat up on the bed watching out the window. 

I listened to them whispering to each other and bringing things back into their own camper. Finally their door shut and all was quiet. My dog curled back up to me and fell back to sleep. I drifted off and was awoken a little bit later by my dog sitting and staring out the window again. This time he was whining. I sat up to see what was going on outside and saw a man standing only feet away from my camper, just over the border of my campsite. He didn't seem to notice me and appeared to be staring off into the distance. He had curly blond hair and was dressed in shorts and a t-shirt. I at least caught that of him as I ducked down quickly thinking he was going to spot me being nosy. It felt extremely awkward. I figured the girls may have had a visitor or family member staying with them that was out checking the night sky. There is a light ordinance in place so the stars are quite spectacular there.

A few minutes later I peeked out again to see the man still in the same spot. He hadn't moved and his eyes seem fixated (from what I could tell) on something well beyond the campground. My dog was also still watching him but wasn't whining or growling.

As time went on, I met the two ladies who lived behind me. I asked them if they had a visitor the night they arrived back from California. They told me no and looked extremely puzzled when I told them about the man I had seen. Unbeknown to me, they have the Ring app on their camper as it is their full time residence. Upon reviewing footage from the evening in question, the camera picked up motion and recorded for 15 minutes. You could clearly see the back of my camper in the footage but nothing else. There was nothing moving, no apparition or person to speak of. 

I don't know what I saw. It was not my partner. It didn't scare me because I thought it was a real person. So strange. The woods directly behind the campsite have had some strange goings on, too. We've seen balls of light floating in the dark that come in and out, and the two ladies say they've heard crying sounds coming from the woods. Now there may be logical explanations for these but it can definitely get creepy where it is so dark.

After the man was seen behind my camper, one of the ladies let me know that she had done something and it wouldn't be back. I'm not sure what she did. She is from the Osage Nation so maybe a ritual of some sort? I didn't ask. This was back in September and so far I have had no sightings of the strange man again."
"Black Hooded Figure At Foot Of My Bed","Wisconsin","Shadow People","As I'm about to write this, I am experiencing chills remembering my experience. I lived in a house built by my great-grandfather in 1903 I believe. It's a dairy farm. I was a child, I can't remember at this time my age. Probably around 10 to 12 years old. My room was upstairs and there are four bedrooms upstairs.

I woke up from out of the blue. I look at the foot of my bed, to the right corner. A black hooded figure... Very large. Absolutely no face just blackness and very defined. Not coming in and out of Shadow. Just there like someone is standing at the end of my bed. The fear was overwhelming, and I took my blankets and threw them over my head. I was absolutely terrified. I didn't know what was going on. I do not even remember how long I was under the blankets. When I finally pulled the blankets back, it was completely gone. I didn't know if I was seeing things or if it was a figment of my imagination.

A week later... My mom and dad they had been arguing. My mom was sleeping upstairs in what we called the purple room. At the kitchen table, she had commented about seeing a black figure in her room. I Realize what I saw was real, it wasn't imagined.

The first time I heard someone outside my family speak of this hooded black figure, was on Ghost Adventures with Loretta Lynn's niece. That was the first time realizing it wasn't my imagination. Someone else had actually seen the same thing. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Someone else had seen the same thing and that it was on a TV show. It really made me feel validated of what I saw. I still think about it. I still have that overwhelming fear that I did as a child. I also have an overwhelming fear that I will see it again. Especially after reading other people's stories on the internet."
"My Unknown Visitor","South Carolina","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I don't know if this would qualify as a true ghost story, but it certainly gave me pause. I lost my daughter back in 2004. Understandably it was unexpected and put me into a state of shell shock. I took to going to the cemetery and would just sit by her gravesite, sometimes crying uncontrollably. I was so distraught that my husband on more than one occasion found me lying on top of her grave. I'm sure he thought I was losing my mind which I felt like I was.

 One day I was there and as usual, was kneeling over her grave crying to the point that my body was shaking. I felt something lay a hand on my shoulder. I looked up and saw a man standing there. He was rather short and meticulously dressed. I had no idea who he was or what he was doing there. He talked to me and told me that I needed to get ahold of myself, my daughter was fine, and my family at home needed me. He said all this in a slightly disciplinary voice. I'll admit it was a bit scary the way he was talking and looking at me. 

I remember that I looked straight ahead away from him for a moment before I turned back to ask him who he was. I was peeved at my perception of the way he had spoken to me. But when I turned around he had disappeared. I looked in every direction but he was nowhere to be found. There was no time for him to walk off, he simply disappeared. It scared me so bad I went to my car and left immediately, all the time checking to see if this person would show up in the cemetery or worse my car. I never saw him again.

 The deal is though I was so wrapped up in my grief that I was neglecting my still-living child. I had no clue on how to honor the memory of one child without losing site of the other. How did this man know all that? Anyway it opened my eyes to how I had been treating my other daughter. It took my unknown visitor to show me what I was doing to my living child and how much I was hurting her."
"My Message For An Inmate","Texas","Psychic / Medium","I know I am a different type of human being than most. What happens to me is very unusual and why I am unusual is something that I have no noticeable understanding for. I just connect to a world which others never encounter. As I have said in my last story; there is no human that can say he/she has actual proof of spiritual contact. For me, spirit contact is proved by my personal view. A witness who sees and feels what I feel and see can be informative but still for science, there are always some way to debunk everything. Only I know there is truth in the supernatural for me personally. That's good enough for me.

My career was working for the State Of Texas. Around 2011, I was working toward my retirement. I had about one year to go and was working in a prison unit in the Panhandle of Texas. For those of you who don't know, the panhandle of Texas is the very top of Texas where the southern most portion of the Great Plains ends.

As a correctional officer, my work usually took me to what was called four building which had three wings to it. This building was for the inmates who were still bucking the system and received a lot more cases against them than normal just for not following the rules and regulations set forth by the state of Texas. Each night I worked a twelve hour shift and each night we were required to start count after we came on shift. Which was around 6:30. These counts went on through the night and into the morning hours with one being bed book count. Bed book count was a visual count. The inmate comes to the cell door and shows his inmate ID card and the officer has his clip board with the inmate roster showing the correct ID number. Both numbers have to match. It is the most important count of the entire twelve hours of shift.

The bed book count usually came after breakfast was served. Breakfast in a prison in Texas is served around 2:30 or 3:00 in the morning. I took my clipboard and attached the roster to it and started in C wing and ended up in A wing. There are twenty one cells on the top row and twenty two cells on the bottom row with two tiers in each of the three wings. My walk started at top and then went to the bottom row. 

As I walked along the bottom row of A wing I had just reached cell nineteen and was busy checking my inmate roster. When I looked up there stood a thirty something, healthy looking, Hispanic man looking at me through the cell door window. He was so close to the cell door window that if he was any closer I would've felt his breath. Being very surprised to see him there I smiled and said something like ""Well I didn't see you there."" Instead of answering me he just stared at me and then turned and vanished in front of my eyes.

I don't normally have goosebumps when I come into contact with ghosts or do I get frightened at all. I just do not let that happen but when I come across a solid looking person that fades quickly into nothingness it has a totally different reaction. I admit that the goosebumps were there and mainly the unreality of the whole incident bothered me for a couple of days.

After the presence had vanished, I could see this older Hispanic man raise up from the bottom bunk and he spoke, ""Who are you talking to boss?"" I said, ""There was a thirty year old Hispanic inmate at the cell door window and he vanished!"" What I said bothered the older man and he was frightened about the cell being haunted. He pointed toward the top bunk and said, ""Boss that bunk has been empty for months. I am the only one here.""

It was then I heard this voice in my head tell me to warn the man on the bottom bunk of a new inmate moving in with him. I have been able to foresee future events before but these events are very random and rarely ever come to me. And admittedly, I have had some occasions where the events never happen after I said they would. Therefore, I am very quiet about repeating my visions to someone. This one I knew had an urgency to it so I knew I had to tell the inmate on the bottom bunk. I told him as directly as I could to watch out for a new inmate sharing his cell. I told him to stay away from the new cellie because something was going to happen where he could get hurt.

A few weeks later, I was in the Line building (The Lieutenant's office). On the wall was taped the photo of this

Hispanic inmate that looked very familiar. Below the photo was the TDCJ inmate's ID card. I was very curious noticing that he oddly looked like the vanishing phantom of cell nineteen in four building so I asked the Lieutenant about him. He answered by saying, ""Oh that guy? Yeah, his picture is up there because he is being transferred out in the morning. We put him in four building, A wing, in nineteen cell. He went to outside recreation and a rival gang member cut his throat.""

 I said, "" So he lived over it?"" The Lieutenant said ""He was in the Infirmary for awhile.""

When I walked into the dayroom of A wing about a week later the older Hispanic inmate showed the other Inmates me (the odd officer that convinced him that the paranormal was real). Then he thanked me for the warning and said he would never forget this crazy thing happening to him. He said he would tell about this experience until the day he died."
"The Ghost In Chicago","Illinois","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","In the summer of 2009, I was visiting Chicago for a work trip and stayed at the historic Hilton Chicago across from Grant Park. My sister also lives in Chicago and my trip coincided with her bachelorette party. After work on a Friday evening, I had dinner with my sister and two of her friends. I distinctly remember only having one glass of wine at dinner, since the next night would likely include more drinking at the bachelorette party. 

After dinner, I went back to the hotel and fell asleep. While sleeping I started having a vivid dream. I was stuck in an elevator. The elevator stopped working. I tried using the intercom to call the operator. The operator started screaming at me through the intercom. It sounded like a cacophony of multiple voices screaming. Suddenly, I woke up; my heart was racing. And that's when I realized being stuck in the elevator was a dream and the voices that were screaming at me were actually coming from the hallway. A group of people walking through the hallway were being ridiculously loud. 

Reality hit me that I had been woken up and I remember feeling very annoyed and thinking I probably won't be able to fall back asleep. I was curled up in a fetal position on my right side. I flipped over to my left side so I could see the time on the digital clock. It was 4 a.m. CT. I sighed, feeling anxious about whether or not I'd be able to fall back asleep. I then rolled from the fetal position onto my back. And that's when I saw it. 

Standing at the foot of the bed, directly in front of me was a man. This man was not completely solid but more solid than an apparition. I could make out every single detail on this man's face but there was definitely a low-key glow radiating through him. To this day I could spot this man in a lineup. His hair was reddish and thinning, high cheekbones, faint mustache, pointy nose. He was wearing a cut-off Celtics jersey. He was staring at me and smiling slightly. Creepy in a ""I'm standing in your hotel room staring at you"" creepy way, but not overly creepy. I did not sense this person to be evil, but I was still scared. We stared at each other for what felt like 5 minutes but was probably 10-20 seconds. My thought process during this time went something like this: ""Did one of those people in the hallway break into my room? No, this doesn't feel like a real person. This feels like a ghost. Maybe it's my guardian angel? Shouldn't my guardian angel be wearing something nicer than a cut-off jersey? Am I having one of those sleep paralysis moments? Can I move? If it's a ghost wouldn't he have left by now? He's still staring at me. It must be a real person. Oh my god, there's a real person in here!"" 

At that moment I decided this person was real. I sat up in bed and screamed while staring directly at this guy. And all of the sudden, right before my eyes - he just faded away. Almost like pixels dissolving into the air. I'm still sitting in the same spot breathing heavily. While sitting I started looking around the room because I was still confused about what had just happened. The door to the bathroom was slightly ajar. And as I looked into the dark doorway I saw his face again, staring right back at me. We locked eyes. And then once again, he just faded away like pixels.

I have never been so scared in my life. I felt incapable of moving or doing anything I was so scared. I curled up under the bed covers completely awake for the next hour. Eventually, I grabbed my cell phone off the nightstand and call my boyfriend (now husband). It was 6 a.m. In New York at that point. He didn't answer. Eventually, I got up and went to yoga in the park with my boss that morning and told her the entire story. Then I asked two different hotel employees if they ever heard any stories and they said no. I can't imagine that is true given the historic nature of the hotel. Later that morning I talked to my boyfriend/husband and he said it was probably a remote viewer who was just ""having some fun, going into different hotel rooms."" I don't know what it was but I know it happened."
"The Stranger N The Shower","Virginia","Misc","One time, when I was like, ten, I was trying to go to sleep. I had just come home from an Iron Maiden (A great heavy metal band, you should check it out) concert, so it was like, 12:30 at night. So I'm trying to sleep, and I am counting the time to pass it. So then, it's like, 1:33 before I know it, and I hear this music playing. It was La Grange by ZZ Top, playing on my mp3 player. It was faint, but I look at it and say to myself, ""I turned this off yesterday morning!"" 

 but I decide it was nothing. So I try to go back to sleep. But at about 2:15, I hear a drumming noise. Then, I heard this cranking noise coming from my brother's room. (He was 13 at the time.) So then I hear this strange combination of sounds. It sounded like a mix of everything I had just heard, but with a scream, a screeching of metal, a groan, and a growl.

 So this scared the absolute crap out of me. So it was like 3:10, and I had to go to the bathroom. I had been holding it since the beginning of the concert, at around 8:00. I don't want to go, because wetting the bed sounds like better option then possibly dying from whatever this noise was. And it was about 4:00 when I go. So our bathroom is kind of spooky, and I open the door.

 Then, I was in the bathroom completely. No turning back now. I look in every corner, but there was nothing there. So, the bathroom was kind of weird. It was a two room bathroom. One section with a sink, and the next room with the toilet and shower/bathtub. And I use the bathroom, and I saw a big pair of blood-red eyes and the outline of a dark figure in the one place I didn't check; The shower. And this was especially creepy because the concert I went to, Iron Maiden? Yeah. Because they sing about satan and death and creepy stuff like that. But, naturally, I ran to my parents' room. Then they checked it out, but nothing was there, and said it was total bullcrap. But I know what I saw.

It was really traumatizing because, well, I was only like ten. Anyways, if anyone knows what could have done this, let me know. It could've been my mind playing tricks on me."
"Little Ghost Girl Trapped In My Friend's Apartment","Massachusetts","Haunted Places","I have always been very attuned to the spiritual realm, and my earliest memories from childhood include sensing spirits in various homes I have visited. I have not experienced anything recently, until a recent visit to my friend's apartment.

She lives in an apartment on the second floor of an old, run down apartment building in a small suburban town outside of Boston. I have visited the apartment one time before, three years ago, but I was going through a period of emotional turmoil and was not focused on my surroundings.

The apartment belongs to an elderly woman in her 80s that my friend is taking care of. My friend is living there as a roommate, but she also assists with caring for her. I do not have the ability to visit the apartment unless the elderly woman is in the hospital or visiting family, and while she allows me to visit when she is not there, she has severe social anxiety and does not do well with outsiders. Due to her health issues and incontinence, the house has an unpleasant odor.

The apartment is square-shaped, and dimly lit. The second you walk through the door, there is a dining room table immediately toward your left, a narrow square-shaped kitchen in front of you, and a large living room to the left. Off the living room is a dark, narrow hallway with a bathroom on the right, which is directly behind the kitchen, and two bedrooms, one to the left and one directly in front. 

The moment I walked into the kitchen, I was immediately hit by a feeling that the atmosphere in the apartment was heavy and oppressive, like something bearing down on your shoulders and neck. It was not just because of the smell. Even when the windows are open, and even though the walls are painted white, the apartment has a dark, oppressive air to it that is absolutely suffocating. It is that feeling where the hairs on your neck stand up and you feel like there is dark energy. I immediately felt that the apartment was haunted. 

Looking straight into the kitchen as I walked in, I stared at the wall at the back end of the kitchen, which was a dark, dimly lit corner. The overhead kitchen light is not working, so the whole kitchen feels very dark. I felt a mass of heavy energy emanating from that part of the kitchen, and even though I could not see anything standing in front of me, I knew that there was something there. I shivered with a feeling of inherent disgust and walked away from the kitchen, into the living room.

I placed my items in the living room on the pull out bed and was drawn toward the back hallway. My friend showed me around again, in case I had forgotten the layout, and I walked into the room at the end of the hall. It was a room with dark green carpeting, blue painted walls, and a bunk bed which belonged to her daughters. The moment I walked into this room, the energy changed to a very sad, wistful energy. There was an air of sadness I could not explain. The room was full of stuffed animals and snow globes, but I got the distinct impression that something was in the right hand corner of the room beside the bed, along the wall that is connected to the other side of the bathroom, glaring at me. I felt that I was being told to leave, like the spirit did not want me there and was uncomfortable with my presence. 

As I was leaving the room, an image popped into my head that I have absolutely NO idea where it came from. It was an image of a little girl around age 8 wearing a blue dress, dressed like how a little girl going to church on Sunday would look. Her hair was blonde and clipped on both sides halfway down in pigtails, sort of like Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz. She had a sad look to her eyes and then suddenly, I got an image of this same girl drowned in the bathtub. The thought made me shudder in fear because I have NO idea where it came from or why I thought it.

I suddenly asked my friend if a little girl drowned in the bathtub in this apartment, maybe 60 years ago, and I described what I had seen. To my great surprise, she has actually SEEN the image of a spirit belonging to a girl with that exact description, at night, peeking her head out from around the bathroom door and walking up and down the hall, disappearing into thin air if you see her for too long. My friend stated that she had an image similarly pop into her head that a little girl who lived there in the 1970s had died by drowning, but she thought it was in the river that runs behind the apartment complex. In my mind, I saw her die in the bathtub.

I tried to forget about this, since I was staying over, and my friend and I went to dinner and then to a healing circle, since she does energy work. During the session, I closed my eyes and said a prayer for the little girl, hoping she will find peace and be able to transition to the afterlife.

That night, I slept well but occasionally woke up in the middle of the night and felt a presence right next to me. I could not see anything and it was pitch black, but I knew it was there. I kept feeling like my eyes were being drawn to the bathroom, and that there was someone staring at me from around the corner of the door. It was extremely unsettling. Every time this would happen I covered my head with the blanket and said a prayer. Eventually, I fell asleep.

I feel as if she is trapped here, and may have been abused, murdered, or committed suicide. Occasionally since I woke up today, I have felt as if I saw something flit by me in the corners of the room, but when I look up I do not see anything. I also have seen the window blinds move about even when there is no wind, and items of mine seem to have been moved or misplaced overnight, only to turn up where I expected them to be after several minutes. 

My friend states that the room where her elderly roommate stays has a dark, demonic energy in it, and that this may be because this woman is a very unkind person who hates children and has attracted negative energy which is slowly enveloping the rest of the apartment. She wonders if the spirit of the little girl is trapped here and is here to protect everyone from the negative energy in the other room. My friend has done energy work to cast out the negative energy, but it returns, because it is attached to her roommate and not to the apartment, whereas the little girl is attached to the apartment. 

My friend also one time was meditating in the living room when she heard the voice of an adult woman, whom she did not recognize, say ""Get out of here now!"" It was trying to get her attention, not to demand her to leave but begging her to leave, encouraging her to leave. She heard it as if it was a voice in the room, but was coming from up above, which did not make logical sense. When she heard the voice, she instinctively looked up. 

I could not live here because even though there is less negative energy today, I do not feel alone in any room and feel as if I am persistently being watched. The bathroom seems to be the center of all the energy and I do not like going in there for any longer than need be. 

I have taken photos of the apartment and will attach them in the comments if anyone wishes to see. I wonder if anyone can sense any energy from the photos or indicate what they feel is happening here."
"Shadow Dog With Red Eyes","Virginia","Pets / Animals","My whole life I've loved scary movies and I have a brother a few years older than me, so its safe to say I was watching them at WAY too young an age. Combined with the fact that I had a very over active imagination, I was scared of everything. The grudge was hiding in my closet, the clown from IT was in the shower drain, Freddy from A Nightmare on Elm Street was hiding under my bed, etc. As an adult, I've been able to write off most of my more unusual experiences and memories as simply a child getting worked up over shadows. However, there's one memory in particular that I cannot for the life of me explain away. 

It's my earliest memory. I had to have been about two years old. I was young enough that I still slept in the crib in my upstairs nursery, with my parents a couple rooms down the hall from me. To clarify, I was too young to have really seen any scary media and my mother was quite protective of me with those things until I was a few years older. I wasn't the best sleeper, and I'd frequently wake up during the night. I remember being uncomfortable alone at night in that room. I assume that's true for most babies? Not scared necessarily, just...uncomfortable. 

When I woke up this night, I remember tossing and turning, playing with blankie and overall just hanging out. All of a sudden I looked over through the bars of my crib and I distinctly, vividly remember a pitch black shape with glowing, deep red eyes. It stared directly at me and I remember feeling the breath on me. I screamed. Cried. My Dad came in and picked me up, carried me to the hall and calmed me down by pointing at all the different parts of a painting hung in that upstairs hallway. I remember counting the apples in the tree with him as he comforted me. When I tell people my earliest memory, its just of my Dad coming in and taking me out to that painting to comfort me. I don't mention the pitch black shape staring at me through the bars on my crib. To be honest, I've tried to write it off for a long time as a dream.

I got to thinking about it recently though. I was only a couple years old. I didn't know what scary stories were, I didn't understand the concept of death or ghosts or demons. I was pretty voraciously sheltered until I was about 5 or 6, and then my brother started in with the scary movies. Is it normal for babies to dream of things like that? I know there's the old internet 'fact' about only being able to dream of faces you've seen before, not being able to create new faces. I don't know if that's actually true, or if it even applies to shadow creatures, but I know I wouldn't have seen anything like that as a child. So I either conjured it in my imagination, or maybe it was something real?

In the above section I only wanted to include what I distinctly remember. But there are more things from that night that I believe happened, they just are a bit more fuzzy. I clearly remember the glowing red eyes and pitch black shape. There were two windows on the opposite wall and I vividly remember the moonlight streaming in through them, before one window - the one on the right - was mostly occluded by the black mass. The fuzzy part is that I remember thinking that it was like a dog, but I don't remember if it was the shape of a dog, or just a black mass at about large dog height. I also think I remember it making a low growling sound, but that could just be my imagination.

That nursery was remodeled into a guest room when we got older, and after I moved out for college, that became the room I stay in any time I visit. To this day, I cannot sleep in that room without a light on. I'm still uncomfortable in there and my anxiety spikes at night if I have to sleep there. 

I've looked into Black Dogs, demon dogs and Death Omens, but I don't believe that anything happened around that time? My grandpa would have lived another year or so and he's the only one that passed when I was a kid. No major life changes either. 

Has anyone heard of anything like this? Not necessarily a Black Dog in a demon dog sense, but something similar? Possibly a different shadow creature with glowing red eyes? Or does anyone know if this just sounds like normal baby imagination? 

Please let me know! Thank you!"
"One Strange Night","Indiana","Haunted Places","In 1985 I was 17 and dating a girl in Valparaiso Indiana.

 Her dad and I became close and we were both Bears fans at the best time you could be one. I was there late one night in December after a game and my girlfriend, mother, and sisters went to bed. It was about two am when we heard this banging outside. He said ""Want to see something?""

 We got bundled up and treaded outside in the knee high snow. They lived outside town in a rural setting with a field across the road and just a few houses on their side. We went around the house and I could see light in their neighbor's shed. Shadows were flashing through the light and you could tell the bulb was swinging. The shed had windows in each door and opened barn style. As we got closer I could see tools flying around the room and banging against the walls. I looked at him ""Hey, what the hell is that?""

 He said ""I've seen this twice, watch.""

 When we got up to the doors he reached up to grab the handle and looked at me just before he grasped it. He said ""Wait."" Then grabbed the handle. It was like a plug was pulled. Light went out and everything stopped. All you could hear was the wind. He said ""Shows over."" We walked back silently.

 I went into the service a few months later and never saw him again. We never talked out it, not once. Twenty years later I ran into my ex girlfriend and told her that story. She said he never told her that. She called him while I was sitting there and he said ""Oh yeah, that was something alright."" She just shrugged her shoulders and said ""Ain't that just like him."""
"Michigan's Haunted Ice Cream Truck","Michigan","Haunted Items","My grandma owns a cabin on a lake in Northern Michigan that I visit every year with all my cousins. There are eight other houses in our community and each one has been in that family for generations. Long story short, the other kids from the other eight hoses have been my best friends since I was born. During the summers, at night, we all meet at the crossroads to play flashlight games. The summer I was fourteen, the strangest thing happened. 

I'm around the older side of the group. There's a girl who is a year older than me, but the majority of the kids are younger, the youngest that specific summer was eight. Sometimes the younger kids would get scared so pretty early on, we made an emergency code word in case one of them got too scared, they'd call it out and we'd stop the game no matter what and find them. It was 11:23pm (I vividly remember looking at my watch), nearly pitch black, and we were playing Sardines. We had just started a new game so there was only one person hiding and the rest of us were wandering around searching for them when we heard ice cream truck music. 

It stands to say that our community is seven miles from the nearest town. We know all the other kids in about a two mile radius and all of them were definitely not out and about (they were all very young at the time, like, five and under) and we know that no one owns an ice cream truck anywhere near us. Why would they? Our community is private and it has a mile long driveway so there would be no point in selling to us and there are hardly any other families around for a few miles. There's no reason why a person would be driving an ice cream truck around in the middle of the day, let alone in the middle of the night. 

Anyway, we heard the ice cream truck music floating over the trees and the oldest girl and I looked at each other and instantly used our emergency word, calling all the kids back to the crossroads. We did a head count and everyone was there. We listened to the music gradually get closer and louder and truth be told, we were all terrified. It went on for about a minute, but it seemed a lot longer. Suddenly, it stopped, and the woods around us were dead silent. Usually, you can hear animals or crickets in the trees but there was nothing. 

We called it quits after that. The oldest girl and I walked all of our friends home, just to make sure because we were pretty freaked. The next night we heard it again at the exact same time: 11:23pm. We called everyone in again and it got louder and stopped about a minute after it started. 

We haven't heard it since. It's been about six years since then, but it still freaks me out to this day and the kids who we were playing with still remember it. One of them (she's fifteen now) brought it up last summer and it still scares her too."
"It Pushed Me In The Shower","Georgia","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I was about 6 years old when this happened to me. Some things may seem confusing, such as why my parents won't believe me now, when one of them was there, but there is a logical explanation that I know that I don't feel comfortable sharing.

 This is definitely not a dream I had, because I clearly remember waking up with a blue thing wrapped around me (being young, I didn't, and still don't, have any idea what it was), getting up, and walking outside to where my grandpa was lighting a fire. I got 7-8 splinters in my feet because I didn't have shoes on.

I had finished taking a shower, and my mom entered the bathroom with a towel. For some reason, I didn't feel like getting out of the shower, and just stood there looking at her in a daze. Normally, of course, I would simply get out, she would dry me off, and help me dress. This time, however, I just stared at her. All of a sudden, it felt like someone pushed me, and I fell towards the faucet, which I happened to hit at just the right angle to where it cut my side. I, at first, didn't feel any pain. In fact, I don't remember any pain or blood. I remember looking in the mirror, which was to my left and seeing a cut in it. I, being young, started crying. My mom asked me what was wrong, but I was hysterical and didn't respond. She turned me around and noticed the cut on my side.

 She proceeded to call my Grandpa, who came over and carried me to their house that was 2 yards over. It was a small neighborhood with only our house next to the road, the yard, a treehouse (an actual one with people living in it), and my grandparent's house. There was another set of houses across the street too, but those aren't important in this story. I don't remember what happened after that other than me waking up in bed.

 All I know is that I was pushed by something, and my mom and I were the only ones in the room. I've told my parents this story now, and they don't believe me. I won't elaborate on why they didn't believe me, but I will answer any other questions regarding this.

Note: Some details may be distorted, or lost with time. I'm not sure about the history of the house. I don't live there anymore."
"The Winged Man Behind The Blackberry Bushes","Colorado","Haunted Places","So, this is going to sound totally crazy, but this still haunts me to this day, and I just had to share. Because of the events that I'm about to share, my parents sold our house and moved us into the city, and we were never allowed outside after dark.

I was about 6 when my family moved into this old farmhouse in the middle of nowhere in Indiana. For context, there was an old barn that was falling apart, several cornfields, some crab apple trees, mulberry trees, blackberry and raspberry bushes, and there was a gun club just across the street that only ever had people around on Sundays. There was a bit of woods beyond the blackberry bushes, and the nearest neighbors was a classmate of mine about a mile down the road. We also had a pretty big yard that was in full view of almost every window in the house, and, as long as we never went past the dirt patch between the yard and the barn or past the trees or bushes, we were able to play wherever we wanted in the yard.

It was early summer, and I was outside playing by myself. At some point in time, I got hungry and decided to snack on some blackberries (this was permitted by my parents as long as we made sure the berries were ripe). I was in the middle of collecting a handful of berries when I noticed I wasn't alone. There was what looked like a man with a wide brimmed hat and a trench coat standing towards the back of the blackberry bushes. He was smiling at me and kept waving for me to come to him, and I grew very confused. Like I said, the nearest neighbors outside the gun club were about a mile down the road, so lost visitors wasn't exactly something that happened regularly. I tried asking him different questions about who he was and what he was doing there, but I only got the wave indicating he wanted me to approach, and I kept hearing this strange wheezing noise.

From what I understand, my mom happened to look out the kitchen window and saw me standing by the blackberry bushes, talking to someone. Now, I was a very active kid with an even more active imagination at the time, so I was always playing by myself and talking to ""imaginary"" people, so it wouldn't have struck her as strange behavior at first. However, when she noticed that I was standing there longer than I would if I was playing a game, she came out to investigate and asked me what I was doing. I immediately pointed to the man in the bushes, and I watched the color drain from my mom's face.

She immediately ordered me to go inside and get my dad. After hearing the fear in her voice, I sensed something was wrong, and I ran to the house as I was afraid she was hurt (she was pregnant at the time with one of my little sisters). As I ran, I heard my mom scream, and something massive burst through the bushes. I don't know why or how, but something told me not to look up or back, so I lowered my gaze towards the ground. That's when I saw it... The shadow of what looked like a man with bat shaped wings.

From here, everything gets fuzzy, but I remember people coming over to the house to ask me questions about the man and what had happened, and my sisters and I were forced to sleep in the living room until my parents finally sold the house later that winter.

I had almost forgotten everything until I was 18 and discovered the movie Jeepers Creepers. Watching both movies, I was reminded of the man I had seen at the back of the bushes and was about to write it off as my imagination when my mom came up and asked me what I thought about the movies. I told her they were scary and reminded me of the man back at the farmhouse, and I could see the color drain from her face. She immediately told me that I was to never bring it up again, but now really curious.

Is there really a creature like the Creeper? What kept it from scooping me up as a kid? Why was my mom so afraid if it was nothing but my imagination? Maybe someone here has answers or some kind of explanation..."
"Dead Man In Brown Old Suit","Texas","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","It was a little after midnight when I fell asleep. I was dreaming I was at the cemetery. It was dark, all I wanted to do was leave and something or someone was not letting me go. The more I ran the longer the cemetery got until something caught my eye, I stopped and saw people digging up a grave. My heart was pounding fast I didn't know what to do; when they saw me they gave me a weird look.

I woke up from my dream, my heart was beating fast. I couldn't breath. I opened my eyes there in front of me was a dead man in a old suit with dirt on his shoulders looking at me. His hair was wavy and gray with a little black and comb to the side. I wasn't afraid of him I turned around to my other side and fell right back to sleep still knowing he was there. I can feel the presence of him and his reaction of me knowing I wasn't scared of him.

In the morning when I woke up I looked to see if he was still there and he wasn't. I got up from bed and walk by where the dead man was standing I felt cold and got goosebumps.

All day the only thing on my mind was a dead man in a old brown suit; was it a dream or was it real? I know for a fact it wasn't a dream I really saw a man in a old brown suit with dirt on his shoulders. Why was he there I don't know him.

This is the second night and I have to sleep in my room wondering if I am going to see him again. All I know if I have a dream of me being at the cemetery at night probably the dead man will be there watching me again while I sleep. Will I wake up or sleep for ever?"
"The Ghost Who We Upset","Texas","Haunted Places","My wife and I were wanting to move to a farming community in the Texas Panhandle with a population of around three hundred. We had lived in Amarillo for eight years and six months. We had heard about a widow that was seriously considering selling her house in this small community one hundred miles away. We looked at the house and it was perfect for our family of two daughters. They were both still young girls and the school close by was a good country school.

It did take awhile to get everything in order due to different problems involved but after the papers were signed on the house, we were overjoyed. We began moving our things in and then my wife began with her preferences of what color the walls should be and different changes in the house. Everything was going great for us at this time except for that first time that I noticed that the house had a certain eerie quality to it.

It was the first or second day after everything was moved and my wife needed some tools to work with so she went over to get the things she needed. I was standing in the kitchen and was leaned against the counter. My wife had been gone only around ten minutes and I heard the garage door raise. I thought that it was very odd that she had came back so soon so I opened the door to the garage from the house and the big garage door was still down. When I went back into the kitchen, I noticed the only garage door opener we had was in the kitchen. When my wife got back I explained to her that I thought we might have a spirit haunting our house. I have a gift or an ability that I have had since I was around five to interact with spirits so she accepted that with a little knowledge that I was capable of knowing whether the house was haunted or not.

Strange things began to happen quite frequently and increased in this house. About eighty five percent of the time spirits contact me in dreams so because of this I am not for sure which category this particular story belongs in. All of my normal human senses also react to the presence of spirits also. I hear their voices very plainly, I smell their perfume and tobacco smoke and I see and feel them. No one who does this has any actual proof regardless; unless there is a witness and still that is not considered proof. All I can say to anyone is what I have experienced. Even videos and photos are not proof to others. I will continue to tell you about the events that followed but I know from my experiences that no one has no need to fear death for life is eternal.

It actually started with dreams of the widow's husband who had died of cancer. They were lucid dreams. One dream has me knocking on the door and J-, the widow's husband opens the door and there is J's cowboy hat moving around the floor. J is a thin man with horn rimmed glasses and he smokes a pipe. His hair is oiled like men did back around the nineteen fifties. He laughs at my surprise at seeing the hat move across the floor. He grabs the top part of the hat and pulls it off of a live parrot underneath. The dreams would happen often. Usually J. Was relaxed and smiling and I was treated like his guest. 

Supernatural things began happening. My daughters' battery operated toys began making noises and running around my daughters' bedrooms. I woke up one time around 3:00 a.m. And every toy in my daughter's bedroom went off.

 Then there was the strangest phenomena I experienced. And that was when my youngest daughter had a sleepover. All the girls were asleep and I got up to get a glass of water. The house was dark and I was walking passed the bathroom where our guests and our daughters had their electric toothbrushes. At that time it was a popular thing among children to have electric toothbrushes with different colored lights on them flashing when they were turned on. That night there were five toothbrushes going off together; buzzing and flashing their lights. It took me awhile to shut them off.

At the time of renovations on this house, I was working four days on and four days off doing twelve hour shifts at night at a state prison. I was driving seventy miles one way. When I came in I would sleep during the day. I always smelled J's tobacco pipe in the master bedroom where my wife and I slept. That particular day I came in and could smell the pipe smoke. I was undressing and feeling kind of devilish so I said "" J- how are you doing today? Oh never mind you are dead!"" I laughed to myself. I fell asleep and had a bad dream that J- was furious at me and as I woke up I heard a man's voice very loud and clear say "" Get your g - mn arm back on that bed."" I looked down and my arm was actually hanging off my bed. That one bothered me because I realized how badly this was about to escalate.

The next day I waited until everyone was out of the house and I went into the Master bedroom and called out to him. "" J- I want to apologize for what I said to you. I hope you accept my apologies. We know this was your house and you are welcome to stay around here as long as you don't frighten my children. I know you will understand because you were also a Daddy. I won't disrespect you again."" I believe we did sage the house maybe but this haunting happened over twenty years ago and J's ghost has never made any problems since then. Since then spirits are always respected and I rarely ever have problems. I still have experiences with spirits as long as I attempt to communicate or just have a connection. I am divorced now and live with my dog. I have slowly been able to disconnect some, all out of respect for my dog. She has a lot of fear and anxiety from me accepting wandering spirits into my apartment for short visits. It's amazing to find so many that are earth bound."
"My Haunted Hospital Experience","Arizona","Haunted Places","Early 2015, I was working in a small rural hospital. The hospital had a wing for regular patients and a wing for prisoners, who would be brought in from the prison that was located in the town. 

The hospital prison wing would only be opened and used if there were 5 or more prisoners admitted. This way, the non-prisoner wing would not fill up with prisoners, making the other patients and their families uncomfortable. I worked the night shift 7p-7a, and because this hospital was small and rural, there was not people/family members walking around the hospital during the night, as you may see in larger, busier hospitals. Anyways, a lab was located in the hospital that blood samples and the like were taken to. If I had time during my shifts, I would run stuff to the lab during down time to help out our CNA's. 

There had been times that I had to run to the prisoner wing...alone, to get some supplies or meds, and the first few times I did, I was super creeped out. There's something about the air and the feel in there that would freak me out. I got the feeling like I was being watched. I would hurry so I could get in and get the hell out ASAP. After the first few times of going in there alone, I always made someone come with me. 

One night while walking to the lab alone, I passed the prisoner wing entrance, which was dark and empty. You could always feel a creepy feeling in and near there. No big deal, just walk fast and get past it quickly. So, on my way back to my unit from the lab, again, I passed by the entrance to the prisoner wing. This time as I passed it, I heard someone WHISTLING a tune in there! I slowed down, and did a quick 2 second peek in through the opening. It was dark and empty. No staff in there- who would be in there? In the dark? And whistling? I know who. No one! So, I quickly ran back to my unit and told a couple of my coworkers, who believed me, but hadn't experienced anything themselves there. 

Fast forward a couple of months.  It was during the summer time, when our patient load is decreased significantly to mostly just locals. Our unit has 20 beds, but this night we had only less than half of that many patients. The unit has only 1 way in and 1 way out for patients. When you walk into the unit, which has an oval shape floor plan, the nurses station is directly in front of you and you have patient rooms on your right and left sides. Each side is a hallway with 10 rooms going down it and there is another nurses station in the back. Each room has a glass front, like an ICU room, so you can see inside the room if the curtain is open. Empty rooms have the curtains open and most occupied patient rooms have them closed for patient privacy. 

This night, the patients were placed in the rooms towards the front of the unit, where the entrance is. Most of the staff, the nurses and CNA's, stayed at the nurses station in the front. One of my CNA's, who was assigned to my patients, ended up sitting in the back nurses station because she needed a computer to chart on. I went to the back where she was sitting, and I was standing on the outside of the counter so I could face her directly and speak to her while she was sitting in front of me. As I'm standing there, talking to her, I'm looking over her head at the empty patient rooms behind her. As I'm talking to her I had to stop, and I'm pretty sure I stopped mid sentence and my mouth stayed open. I saw a man, with a patient gown on, walk from one side of an empty room to the other! I saw him, full apparition, go from one end to the other! I KNEW that those rooms were all empty.

The CNA, watching my face, started loudly saying, ""WHAT? WHAT?  WHAT'S GOING ON?"" and she jumped up thinking that someone was behind her. I told her not so calmly that I saw a man in room 113. I went to tell the other nurses. They checked to see if a patient had died in that room and no one had. The beds in all the rooms are ICU beds and used for ICU and non-ICU patients and we wondered if the bed was one that maybe a patient had died on. There was no way to check. 

This was the topic of the night, since it amped us all up. A few hours later, the little old housecleaning lady came in to the unit clean some stuff and overheard us talking about the apparition I saw.  She wanted to share her story and started telling us what she experiences when she cleans the prison wing. She told us that when she cleans in the prison wing, by herself, she will hear someone WHISTLING in there! I was like HOLY CRAP! I heard the whistling coming from there a few months ago! This TOTALLY validated my experience! 

When I first started, there was one particular room that was up by the front nurses station that would catch my eye. There were times that I would be charting at one of the computers that faced that room or walking by that room and, out of the corner of my eye, I would see what looked like a man standing at the doorway. When I would look, it would be gone. You could just see it like out of the corner of your eye. I told one of the nurses who had worked there for a while and she told me that a male patient had recently passed away in that room."
"Lost In My Room","North Carolina","Misc","It's been awhile since I've shared anymore of my paranormal experiences, and have been meaning to write about another one of them. This is one that had happened to me when I was a child, so I don't remember a lot of details from it, but do remember the ones that I could never forget, which were the important parts of this experience.

 The year would have been around 1997/1998. I was around 9 or 10 years old then, when this happened. 

 This again, was another experience I had in my childhood home, that I was unable to have an answer to how, or what just happened.

 I'd like to start off by saying that I have not been known to be a sleep walker, but for some odd reason, while I had this bedroom as a child, I had 3 episodes of sleep walking. But after moving into my big brother's bedroom, which was directly beside my mom's bedroom (sharing a wall), after my older brother had passed away, I never had anymore sleep walking experiences.

 It was late in the night, as my mom and I were both asleep at this time. My older brother I had mentioned, was no longer living with us, as his illness had become worse, to where my grandparents that lived right next door to us, had taken him in, to help care for him, as my mom was our soul provider, having to work, and care for her 2 children (my father had passed away before I was born). 

 At some point during the night, I had began sleep walking in my room. No telling for how long. My room isn't even really that big either. It's actually very small, and cramped from the bedroom furniture and toys. I always slept with my door shut, because it made me feel a little safer to be in my protective bubble of my bedroom, from the pitch black hallway, that I could always feel a presence at. So to have my door closed, helped me not feel them watching from my doorway as much, or walking by it etc.

When I finally woke up from my sleep walking episode, I was standing in the middle of my bedroom, in pitch black. Fyi, as a child, I know most feel safe with a light of some sort on, in their bedroom, but as for me, after constantly feeling someone watching me as a child, in my room or wherever else in our house, I got to where I found comfort in sleeping in the dark, with the theory of if there is something there in my room, I don't want to see it, so to have no light on, made me not worry about seeing something I couldn't unsee.

 As I realized that I must have been sleep walking, I tried to find my bed, to get back in it, and just go back to sleep. I remember not being freaked out at this point, by waking up out of my bed, standing in the middle of my room.

After fumbling around in the dark, trying to locate my bed, which shouldn't be no more than just a step away from me, I couldn't seem to find it. Again, not freaking out yet, I just assumed I was remembering wrong, that my bed was not on the side of my room that I had thought, and it was on the other side of it, where it use to be, a few years prior. 

 I start to fumble around on that side of my bedroom, which again, is only a step away, I felt what I thought was my toy box, on top of my bed, and thought that was really weird, but being tired and frustrated that I can't seem to find my bed, I didn't think much more of it, and just tossed it off, what I thought was my bed, and tried to get into bed.

As I climbed in ""my bed"", I fell off the sides of it lol realizing this didn't feel right, and finally decided to just go and turn my bedroom light on, and find my barring.

As I tried to walk to my light switch, located beside my bedroom door, on the wall, I noticed I couldn't get to it. The way my bedroom was set up at that time, I had a big wooden daybed, that was in front of my bedroom door, when you walked in. I had a tall dresser, that was on the side of my bedroom wall, beside my bedroom door, as you walked in. So if you're standing in my doorway, you had the foot of my daybed in front of you, and my tall dresser beside you on the right, to where you only had a small open area to walk between the 2, to enter the middle part of my room. 

As I'm trying to get to my light, and realizing that I can't, I go to feel what is stopping me, and as I rub my hand across what felt like a flat wood surface, that I knew felt just like my wooden toy shelf, that was on the other side of my room, is what really started to make me freak out. 

I thought how that was crazy and made no sense for that to be what I'm feeling, where I know it shouldn't be, I try to reassure myself that I'm not thinking right, and again go to feel what is stopping me to get to my light switch, and this time, I even beat on it a little, to see if it was indeed my wooden toy shelf, because the way it's made, it didn't require any nails or screws to put it together. It had wood pieces you wedged to hold the shelves together, and just set the flat wood shelves in the grooved spots they went. So if you were to smack on the top of the shelf, it made a certain sound I knew it did, because it wasn't nailed down etc.

At this point, I'm freaking out, and finally scream for my mom. She comes to my rescue lol and very annoyed to be woken in the middle of the night, opens my door, and turns my light on, and says ""what""? 

I'm still standing in the exact same spot that I was, afraid to move anymore in my room, that wasn't making any sense, to see that there's nothing in front of me, that should have been blocking me to my bedroom light switch. 

My mom noticed my TV on the floor, and started flippin' on me for it, as I realized the ""toy box"" I thought was on my bed, was apparently my TV, on my little wooden TV stand lol, that I fell off of, thinking it was my bed 😅 

What I don't understand is how any of this was possible, for me to have any problems getting back into my bed, or to my light switch, when my room is as small as it is, and nothing should have been in my way, to get to either of those places. 

I'd like to also mention, my wooden daybed does have like a wood couch like arm area, as daybeds normally do, but it is only like 2 or 3 inches wide, and is solid wood at that, and is bolted together etc. But what I was feeling in front of me, definitely was not that! 

It's something that I've never been able to make any sense of, since then.

Just a quick add, my other 2 sleep walking episodes I had during this time I slept in this bedroom, was 1 being me making it to my bathroom, that is directly across from my bedroom, in the hallway, and I had woken up in there, again in the dark. But my bathroom is crazy small, to where everything is crammed together, with your full sink with cabinets on one side, the toilet in front as you walk in it, and the bathtub on the other side. So if you're standing in the doorway, you'll have the toilet in front of you, the sink on your left side, and bathtub on your right. You can only take like 2 steps max, in this tiny bathroom, but again, I was unable to find the light switch, after trying for so long to find it, and again, had to scream for my mom to help. Which I'm sure at this point, she's thinking I'm crazy to keep getting lost in such small rooms lol 😅

The last sleep walking episode had me make it to our living room door, to outside, before I finally woke up, and fortunately wasn't lost with this area lol it's scary to think how far I could have gotten before I woke up, or why this kept happening to me, and then stopped when I switched rooms? 

Having to sleep in that room as a child, made me constantly fear night time, and what I would experience that night. Between hearing, or feeling things in there, or throughout our house, it all seemed to be worse when I was in that room. 

I hope what all I had wrote makes sense, and explained everything to where y'all are able to understand it. But if anyone knows anything about what I had experienced, and what could have been causing it, I'd really like to hear y'all's input about it, because I'm at a lost for answers on this one."
"The Ghost I Named ""feet""","South Dakota","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","After my older brother left around 2006, I transferred rooms to where his room became my room. For the first few months, it was nice having a larger room. Then one night, I awoke to the sensation of someone standing on my bed. I could feel a shifting weight to my lower left, next to my feet. It stepped to the right, just below me. I was looking, but I couldn't see any form, it was just like an invisible person was walking on my bed. I was quite scared, but I didn't know what to do. What do you even do? So I stayed awake and followed the steps with my eyes. I typically lay on my left side, and I tried to not move too much. The thing had a very set pattern to it. It would walk the perimeter of my bed either clockwise or counter-clockwise. It would then stop for a moment with both feet together either in front of my face, behind my back, or behind my knees. After that pause, it would then return to patrolling the perimeter in the opposite direction it had started with. Since it didn't seem to touch me or interact, and I was really tired, I was eventually able to fall asleep only just before dawn. 

Given the frequency of these nightly visits, I came to become used to them. After this most common of occurrences, I named them ""Feet"". I'd awake in the middle of the night to feel them there, say ""Hello Feet"" and return to sleep. I'd also encounter Feet during the day; I'd be sitting down playing videogames and I'd feel them walking on the chair. The weight would shift as they walked through and around me. However, this was not the only thing Feet did. I once heard someone calling my name when I was home alone. There was a time when I was shaken awake. You know how you put your hand on someone's shoulder? It was that. I could feel a hand on my shoulder, but it was lighter in some way. As I opened my eyes, I missed the first part of what was whispered directly into my ear, but it ended with ""You and me"". I use gender neutral terminology with Feet, as whenever I heard their voice, I could never tell if it was male or female. Thus began the physical interactions Feet had with me, where I'd feel myself being touched. A hand pressed against my forehead as if checking my temperature, or my legs being tugged. Even my pillow being moved. This was in my waking day too, feeling a hand trail my spine as I stood sometimes. Whilst I had become used to the walking, which was still the most common occurrence, each of these odd encounters would awaken the fear again. Only after I moved out, Feet didn't follow me.

A few years ago, I opened up to my dad about my experiences and he seemed shocked. He said that my brother had experienced similar, but that when he told my dad, he'd written him off as having been dreaming. He called up my brother and we had a speakerphone conversation. My brother had experienced having footsteps on his floor rather than his bed. He had similar audible and physical experiences, but it sounded like Feet liked my brother far less. His limbs being pulled on or his body being scratched was far more common for him versus having footsteps. Whenever Feet spoke to him, it was more unpleasant. He'd been called a pig, stuff like ""Why are you still here?"" We were all a bit shook up; my brother and I for having had similar experiences and my dad for not having believed my brother.

My stepmother has been uneasy with the room. She covers her ears when we bring it up because she will ""freak out if she knows,"" but she's had her own indirect experience. She's set her rocking chair she smokes in near enough to the room. She's noted that during the night, it frequently sounds like someone is walking around in there. She's made dad wake up and check too, cause they can sound so real or that they ""run to the door"" on occasion, like she feels Feet is charging at her. I have no idea who or what Feet is, or how or why they're in that room. Nor am I certain why my experience with them was so tame in comparison to my brother; where he'd be scratched and pulled, Feet invited themselves onto my bed and would touch me normally. Yet Feet seemingly still remains there, still walking about in a long emptied room."
"My Friend Came Over To My Haunted House","New York","Haunted Places","I debated adding this, but I can't seem to stop thinking about it so...

Just to catch you guys up real quick. The area I live in is one of the oldest in my country. The city I live just over the bridge from dates back to the late 1600s. The history of the region as a whole is rather blood soaked. And the city itself is notorious for its hauntings.

My home was built in the early 1900s. Making it one of the oldest in my section of the town. The only buildings that are older date back to the 16-1700s.

My home has two sets of staircases. A more ornate staircase at the front of the home, obviously meant to impress guests. The other is a steep, dark, fully enclosed set of stairs at the back of the house. A staircase that is obviously meant for servants. It even leads from the kitchen (which has a butler's pantry) to the 2nd floor of the home.

My house even had a carriage barn in the back. My Father had to tear the barn down when I was a kid. It had become dangerously unstable, and there was just no saving it. The foundation however, is still there.

I have a friend I hang out with pretty regularly. She has had paranormal experiences as well. While we don't consider ourselves mediums or anything. We do consider ourselves a bit more open to the world around us then most people are. A few months ago, she came over to my house for the first time. There was a concert going on at a nearby park that we were planning on attending. We met at my house because the concert was outdoors and it was too hot to meet at the event. So we met at my house, had dinner, and had my Mother drive us down to the event.

When she got to my place, the first thing she did was marvel at just how heavy the air in my house felt. She said it felt like the house was welcoming her in. We had a good hour or two before we had to get ready, and she had heard all about my experiences. So I took her through the home and showed her where the ""hotspots"" were. I took her everywhere, from my old bedroom, to the upstairs bathroom. Everywhere. Even the basement. I even went so far as to point out all of the pieces of furniture we had in the basement that my Grandfather had made before his death in the 90s.

While we were walking around my friend kept remarking on how heavy the air felt, how she felt like she was being watched, and how the atmosphere seemed to shift and change depending on what we were talking about. Shortly before dinner, we went down to the basement so my friend could throw something in my washer (she had gotten a stain on her clothes earlier in the day. So being pressed for time, she simply brought a change of clothes and asked if she could wash her clothes at my house). While she was standing at the washer, she mentioned that she felt like there was someone standing directly behind her, staring over her shoulder. Something that I had felt so often down there, that I had actually grown used to it. She said that it didn't so much feel threatening; just that whatever was down there wanted us to leave.

We went upstairs to sit in my Living Room and talk while we waited for her laundry to finish. While we were talking, I realized there were two places on my property that I had had experiences that I hadn't shown to my friend. So, I got up and took her to those places. The first place was my backstairs.

The second she walked through the door that leads to the backdoor, her demeanor started to change. She went from smiling and joking around, to scared, and saying that she was starting to not feel well. So, we left the back stairs and went back to the living room (I took her to the backyard as well, but nothing really happened, and it was too hot to stay outside). 

My friend started talking about how she felt like there were at least a few familial presences in the house (which makes sense. We have a memorial statue for a baby my parents lost shortly after birth sitting on our porch, and we have a lot of family heirlooms in the house.) But then she said something that left me pretty shaken. She looked me dead in the eye and told me that whatever familial presences were in the home, as well as whatever other entities were there, we're almost certainly protecting my family and I from whatever was up the backstairs.

It was just after she said that, that we both felt the very air around us change. It was like the spirits were telling us to stop talking about them. It was in that moment that we both realized that even though the ""good"" spirits in my home were protecting us, they didn't like people talking about them at length. They were the sort of spirits that wanted to be acknowledged and then left alone.

As soon as we came to that realization, I pulled out my phone and started texting a mutual friend of ours. I had been planning on doing a bit of ""ghost hunting"" around my house to celebrate the coming Halloween season. We were never going to do anything beyond sneak around my house at night and scare ourselves sh*tless, but our mutual friend had purchased a couple pieces of actual equipment and was acting a little too eager.

We had originally been planning on doing a little adventuring to celebrate the coming of Fall and the start of ""spooky season"" (we all love Halloween). I was planning on telling her and anyone else we had with us something along these lines: ""No ghost hunting equipment is to be brought into my house, no EVPs, no EMF Gauges, no digital audio recorders, etc, cameras are ok but if I tell you not to record in a certain area I'm going to expect you to respect my wishes. I was going to make it so the rules would be as clear and easy to follow as possible. I realized that if I let her anywhere near my house, she would most likely get over excited and ignore the rules that I was planning on putting in place on our little ""ghost hunting adventure"" And by doing so, she'd unleash something that I wouldn't be able to stop.

I ended up cancelling the entire hunt out of an over abundance of caution. And I unfortunately had to tell the person I was texting that I didn't think it would be a good idea for her to come over at all... Ever... I feel like I dodged a major bullet. But I also feel like I'm now responsible for protecting people from my house; as well as protecting my house from people looking to take advantage of the situation.

It's important to note, that in the days after my friend came over, the air in the house felt lighter. Almost like the spirits were thanking us for acknowledging them. I've also taken to quietly announcing myself and my intentions whenever I go down to the basement (I'll usually say something along the lines of ""Hello. I'm just coming down here to deal with my laundry. I'm not here to disturb you. I'll be leaving the basement as soon as I'm finished with my chore). Something which has helped with the overbearing feeling a great deal."
"Ghost Playing Tricks At Work","South Carolina","Haunted Places","This event happened this past Sunday I think (9-11-22) around mid-morning.

I work part time at a local grocery store and I have only been here currently for 4 months. 

I was doing my normal routine at work, which comprises of mainly working with produce.

I was walking towards the backroom of my department and just as I was a few feet from approaching the entrance I felt like someone quickly rushed up on me and dropped towards the back of my legs or my feet, as if to bump into my knees and knock me over. I quickly turned around to look to see if someone had fell behind me but no one was there. I said ""WTF?"" 

Occasionally we get a few bad a** kids that come in the store and like to play tricks but honestly this sounded/felt more like an adult, or at least someone bigger than just a kid. I looked to see if maybe I had dropped something out of my pockets but everything was still in place and nothing on the floor. 

I have to admit, I was a bit startled. However, I thought nothing of it and proceeded the backroom and into the cooler to get some items to put out on the floor.

When I returned to the backroom and got to the cooler door I noticed that the power switch for the cooler was turned off. I told myself ""Who in the he** came back here and turned the switch off?"" ""I know I didn't do it"".

I wasn't gone long so I doubt anyone had the chance to walk back there. I was the only worker in my department present that day and none of us ever touches that switch until it's time to close the department at night.

I turned the switch back on and entered the cooler. When I got about halfway in the lights flickered on and off and dimmed briefly. It has never done that before so I found that awfully strange. Startled, I quickly walked out of the cooler to see if someone was playing with the light switch but it was still positioned ""On"". 

I walked back in the cooler, got the items I needed and then hastily walked back out to the floor. I was a bit on edge at this point.

Nothing else happened for the day, but the story doesn't end there...

Several days later on an early morning shift, I had mentioned the event to one of my co-workers who works in the department with me, then a little while later I mentioned it to another co-worker (these two are actually mother and son). The mother had told me that she believe there is a ghost in the backroom because some time back she felt like someone was rubbing on her back in a downward pull motion and she eventually had to yell at ""It"" to stop. She said that after told it to stop, nothing else happened since.

I usually work on the closing shift alone and as such I'm always alone in the backroom. I never experienced anything out of the ordinary or had any weird sensations, aside from seeing what I ""thought"" was a person out of the corner of my eyes. It startled me but I always found logical explanations for that due to the shape of certain objects in that room.

However, after what happened recently I am a bit more wary about working back there alone. I'm not so much as afraid of the activity in and of itself as I am of the possibility that this ""Thing"" might try to attach itself to me, or worse, have malicious intent.

Whatever it was seemed to only pass through every once in a while though because as mentioned before, that was the only time since I've been employed there that I experienced anything.

That said, I have to mention though that there have been a few times when I noticed some other strange things that has happened at work before, but I never attributed it to paranormal activity...

One time a few months ago I went to the cooler in the backroom of my department and noticed that one particular pallet that was in there was practically ransacked, when before it was stacked neatly and secured. I was so pissed because I thought maybe a worker from another department came in and got something off the pallet and let everything fall over without even trying to fix it back. Note, I was the only worker from my department on duty that day and on that shift, but every once in a while a worker from another department may need to come to the cooler to get some things. Finally putting it down to just a collapse, I put everything back in place and continued on with my day. 

Another thing I have noticed lately is that sometimes I can stock and neatly straighten items in a particular location of the produce room in my department, and I can leave for just a few moments and by the time I return everything I had just previously straightened would be all out of place. But I would never see anyone enter or leave the produce room when this occurs. Granted, it doesn't take but a minute for a customer to quickly come in and make a mess, but I just find it odd that I can sometimes be close by and never actually catch anyone when this happens.

This is not the scariest of encounters, but it is all very strange nonetheless...

If any more phenomena occurs I will be sure to return for updates."
"Man In A White Car","Washington","Misc","Man in a White Car

There are times when all of us have passed through a gauntlet of trial and tribulation. We have become discouraged, broken-hearted, or not only disappointed in life but have peered beyond the precipice of despair to slip and fall into its depths... 

I am fortunate to have had an experience that confirms, despite horrors in life, that good, purpose, and order do exist in the universe. 

This is an odd story. It involves my Mother, brother, and myself... It also involves a protective agent; some say an Angel, a spirit of a loved one who has passed on, or coincidentally a human possessing omniscience regarding place, time, and the ability to read the minds of young children with the moral fortitude to act upon this knowledge. It's still a mystery to me. 

My Mother, at the request of family and friends, has begun writing her life story as well as accounts of her spiritual journey on the Christian path. 

The following is her account: 

""I want to tell you a true story about my two little kids who set out one dark night to find their Mother. Two boys one around five and a half, and his little brother around three and a half. 

 I had wanted to go to church one Sunday night and because the boys were very young I had decided to hire a baby sitter so that I could go to church and take in the service without distractions. The girl that I had hired lived next door and was sixteen and her parents were home in case she had any problems.

 As I did not drive in those days, I got a ride to church that Sunday night service that started at 7:00pm. Towards the end of the service (it must have been around 8:30pm) someone came and got me as I had been praying at the altar and said ""your children are at the door of the church."" I looked at them completely shocked and said ""that can't be, they are home, most likely in bed by now.""

 They insisted I come to the back of the church and see for myself. The church had some stairs that went down to the front door and there standing at the foot of the stairs were my two little boys who had dirty faces, dirty clothes, noses running... And I was in complete shock!...as I saw this my mind could not perceive it as reality...

Why they were here? What happened!? 

 I ran down the stairs and hysterically said to my oldest boy ""How did you get here?"" What are you doing here? My oldest boy said he wanted to find me, his ""Mommy,"" so he grabbed his brother's hand and set out to do just that. 

Because I very rarely ever went anywhere without the kids they were not use to being watched by baby sitters. So they snuck out of the house and took off down the dark road to find their Mom. 

We lived about five miles from the church and down at the end of our road was a large area that was leading up to a hill and in those days there was very little housing in our Washington neighborhood, Just a lot of woods and darkness. 

 My oldest son said they were walking along this dark road and a car drove up and a man asked them where they were going, he replied (my son clearly remembers telling him) ""to church to find my Mommy."" The boys did not know where the church was, just that their Mom was ""at church."" By the way my son said it was a white car and he did not remember what the man looked like. He said that the ""man"" just said get in and I will take you to your Mom. So in the car they went and they drove right up to the doors of the church. He said the man said to go up the steps to the church and open the door and they would find their Mother. 

My son said the man never spoke to them other than to tell them they would be all right and he would make sure they found their Mom. Since the youngest boy was too young to tell much he just smiled and wiped his nose!

 So here I stood with my mouth open and could not even think about the danger that my two little boys had been in... I of course asked the person who took me to take me and the boys back home and to try to find out what had happened. 

When we got home the people next door were frantic and had called the police, however as yet they had not shown up. In those days living out in a rural area before the days of cell phones, the response of officials was very slow. Our baby sitter noticed right away that the boys were gone and started looking with the help of her parents and they all were frantic and upset. 

So when we drove up with the two kids, the mother of the baby sitter started immediately cussing me out because she was so very upset about the situation. The officials were then notified that the children were safe and at home. After much discussion all of us went back to our homes.

 We never found out who it was that picked them up! I sat down and began to think about what had happened. What person in their right mind would pick up two small boys in the dark, take them to a church where the children themselves had no idea where it was?""

 End of my Mother's account. 

I'm the three and half year old ""little brother"" in the account and was too young to remember this incident. My late brother however recalled it vividly and told me of this event several times when we had late night chats. He recounted that several times during the drive he tried to see the face of the man who drove us; the man always just managed to have his face averted or shadowed. 

This happened in the sixties. We were just ordinary children. We grew up to have ordinary lives. I wish I could remember...

Despite the darkness and despair, I've lived long enough to know that mystery, beauty, and love continue to exist outside of ourselves."
"Were They Just Dreams Or Something More?","South Carolina","Misc","It's been quite a while since my last post on here. Where have those two years gone?

Nothing extra ordinary has happened in those intervening years that I had noticed until 4 months ago.

I was put out of work due to injury on the first of May this year. My surgery was two weeks later on the 19th. Due to the anesthetic my first few nights after the surgery were just straight up blackout sleeps. No dreaming or awareness of anything around me. On the fourth night, that Sunday, I felt like the anesthesia was out of my system enough that I finally wanted to try some of this Jack Daniels cola I had gotten a few days before my surgery. So I drank one before bed (it was decidedly meh) and laid down for the night. I had my door closed because the pull chain for my ceiling fan lights stripped out and if I wanted to have my fan on while I slept the lights had to be on too. I don't remember what time it was or what I was dreaming about, but I was awakened by four quick, sharp raps on my door, like *raprap**raprap*, jerking me out of a very deep sleep. I sat up in bed and listened for any follow up sounds but all I heard were my parents sleeping in the other room. I don't know if I dreamt the knocks or if they were perhaps a warning to wake me from a potentially longer, more permanent nap due to the alcohol and anesthetic. I told my mom about it the next day and she shrugged it off and said it was probably the dog slapping the door with her tail, but I know the difference between the dog's tail thumping against the door and someone knocking.

The other incident happened about a month and a half later and requires a bit of exposition.

I have a sort of love/hate relationship with night time. On the one hand I love that it's quiet and not so busy like during the day, however, to me the night has a sort of imposing feeling to it. Like a weight that settles over everything and makes things feel oppressive and lonely. I also hate sleeping at night as that's when I have the darkest (no pun intended) dreams.

I won't get into details, but the dreams will generally start normal and then will get darker, both literally and figuratively until I usually force myself to wake up. I typically wake up between 2:30am - 4am and my head feels heavy and my heart is racing.

This last time was the same but with a slight twist.

I don't remember exactly what I was dreaming about only that I was talking to someone, or something, when suddenly, for some reason, I lunged at the other with my right arm out as if to grab them. That sudden motion is what caused me to wake up as my body had followed suit in the motion. What makes this different from the other dark dreams is that even though my head was heavy at first the feeling passed almost as soon as I woke up whereas normally it would take a few minutes. Another thing is that at the moment I woke I was aware of something moving in the periphery of my right eye. It looked like something moved across my dresser and out the door (I had it open that night and my lights/fan off). I only caught brief motion and no definitive shape or features unfortunately. The last thing was that when my dream self lunged it had reached forward with its right arm, but when I woke my right arm was reaching towards my door to the right of me like I was reaching for whatever just ran off.

I don't know what to think about these two experiences. There hasn't been anything else happen since and I even questioned submitting them as they are dream related and I know the site's rule about those. Let me know what you guys think."
"We Summoned Something: A Strange Experience","New York","Misc","The following is a story I've been meaning to convey for sometime and due to a recent submission by another poster, who's story in part has a similar occurrence, prompts me to relate my experience.

This happened when I was a teen many years back in upstate NY where I grew up. I had a rather bizarre friend at the time, who despite his own encounters with the supernatural (most of which were unpleasant) insisted on trying to explain away everything with logic and rationale. It used to really irritate me to no end because he would do this with even cartoons and shows we watched, it kind of spoiled the wonder and imagination for sure! I was and still am fascinated with ghost stories and the supernatural, pretty open minded but with a healthy dose of skepticism.

One day we were in my room having a discussion about the paranormal. I was tired of him finding loopholes in stories and of course being a teen, I wanted to be right, so I had found a story I didn't think he could argue his logic into. Because of what happened, I to this day won't relay the exact story I told him, a story I had come across in a book on ghost stories. In fact I haven't really told many people about it at all. Sufficed to say the story basically involved a man's ghost being seen by several people many miles away from where he at that very moment in time had been killed. A lot of evidence was presented in the story and so I figured it was fodder for a discussion about ghosts that I would surely win. We talked about it at some length.

It was a bright, sunny and warm day while this was going on and my parents were downstairs. Though I had some odd experiences in childhood, my home was never considered haunted, at least in the traditional sense. As we talked, something in the atmosphere of my room began to shift, it was subtle at first, but I was sensitive, and did notice it. I was so passionate about the topic though and I tried to disregard it. It felt as if there was a pressure building, something definitely felt off. It suddenly felt as if we weren't alone and I was having difficulty arranging my thoughts and expressing them. My room which had always been a haven for me, always a safe space, always good energy, began to become a very unpleasant and unfamiliar place to be in. My friend's face suddenly went blank and he stopped talking. I hadn't said anything to him or indicated how I felt up to that point, but when I started to say something else, he stopped me and said ""Wait."" At that moment I blurted out ""Do you feel that too?"" He merely nodded and his eyes went wide.

We decided at that point, that whatever was happening was too uncomfortable and to vacate my room. It didn't feel threatening, or dark or evil, but it was as if we had become enveloped in some sort of cloud that had a pressure to it and it didn't feel right or normal. I remember we moved quickly down the hall and went downstairs but whatever it was was still with us. I can see it all clearly in my mind even now. My mom was sitting on the couch and slightly distracted, but I told her we were going outside and she nodded and told us it was OK. Looking back, it was so bizarre, I could see my mom, but it was as if she was separated from us by some sort of field, like we were in some kind of fog, the afternoon sun was still streaming in the window behind my mom and I could interact with her, but I felt cut off, reality definitely wasn't running right. 

We went outside to the garage, but 'it' was still with us. I couldn't feel the sunshine, the warmth, and the normal outdoor sounds of a village street had all but ceased. I had begun to panic, not because of the entity, (at that point I wasn't truly aware it was a presence) but because it felt as if I was cut off from the real world so to speak, as was my friend. Looking back I have trouble really relaying what I felt and saw, it's unlike anything I had ever encountered, at least until I read the recent story posted and that brought it all back. At that point we tried to flee, to outrun it and started down the tree lined street I lived on, moving towards the downtown area. 

Then it happened. We got down to the first intersection of a side street and suddenly it's as if we stepped through a curtain, as if the field had shattered and we were suddenly thrust back into the real world. ""It"" was gone, I felt the sun, and it was warm, the street's sounds had returned; children playing, birds chirping, someone mowing a lawn, and the 'fog' had lifted. It's as if we had stepped out of a vacuum of some sort. 

We both talked about it, but couldn't arrive at anything rational. It shook me up for sure, and later when I returned to my room, the old familiar warm and safe feeling of my room had returned, the alien presence had gone. I asked my mom later if she had noticed anything unusual when I had talked with her during the episode and she only stated I had appeared subdued at that time.

To this day it's not something I can explain. The feeling of unreality, the closest I can come, is like when a person's sick. Everything feels off, reality isn't our day to day experience when sick, perhaps because our physical senses are overwhelmed. I know because many people who have been sick with colds or the flu describe a similar feeling and I've had it too (it's why I hate being sick). Did my feelings of fear play into it? I am certain it amplified the experience for sure, but it did not cause it. The fact that my friend and I noticed the change in atmosphere at the same time without saying a word about it to each other and the fact that it left as suddenly as it had come on, makes no sense. Fear usually takes some time to come down from, it's not something that occurs at the snap of someone's fingers, unless it's not your fear you're feeling. I'm somewhat empathic, so I'm no stranger to someone else's emotions coming and going in my space. Although fear can inspire a feeling of unreality as well, I have experienced extreme anxiety and panic and know the difference between that sense of unreality and what I went through that day, it was definitely different. I have gone over this from several different angles, and it took some time to realize that there was some form of spiritual presence there that day. Most of whatever fear and panic I had were directly related to the fact that I felt as if my sense and connection to reality had been turned upside down, not from a potential ghost. I had felt no evil or malicious or negative feelings in whatever was there.

 The story I related to my friend wasn't even scary, just a bit creepy, the kind of goose bumps you can get from hearing something bizarre and unexplainable. However because of what happened that day, I refuse to speak the story aloud again.

My conclusion is somehow in discussing the supernatural the way we had that day, drew something to us. Either a drifting spirit or the object of the story itself. Perhaps it was just curious or wanted attention? Maybe it realized it was freaking us out and that's why it left so suddenly? Since that day I make sure I'm protected whenever I so much as read a ghost story, either on this forum or in a book, much less speak it aloud to anyone. I firmly believe that you don't need a Ouija Board or a fancy séance to summon a ghost, merely being curious and having an open mind can provide a portal for these experiences. I've had it happen enough, that it has been entrenched in me.

This experience was a key in forming my beliefs in the supernatural and continuing to fuel an endless fascination in these types of encounters as well as anything in the spiritual realm. However it doesn't mean I wish to encounter ghosts myself, it happens of course, but for me, it's enough to read and study these experiences, I don't go looking for them myself, that I know leads to trouble, take it as advice if you will.

I will mention in closing that my friend, later on sort of went into some darker spiritual matters, and he had some personal issues, so he may very well have been key in summoning this spirit/ghost/entity/presence. He as I mentioned earlier had some rather unpleasant supernatural encounters prior to this experience. Of course we were both teens, which has endlessly been speculated about in poltergeist happenings (though this experience doesn't fit that category) so again that is something that could have contributed. I know it wasn't my imagination, yet I can't find too many rational justifications for what occurred, but I concede that I could always have overlooked something. That and to others like the poster who inspired me, who have had similar experiences who could add something further to this story, it's most welcome. Other than that, it's another bizarre yet fascinating story from my past."
"The Floating Head At The Foot Of My Bed","Missouri","A Haunted Life","I had an interest in unexplained phenomena by the age of nine and loved to listen to my parents read ghost stories, or hear stories around the campfire at Girl Scouts, but did not think that I would ever see a real ghost myself. One evening that would change.

I was eleven years old and living in my parent's home in the Brookside neighborhood in Kansas City, Missouri. Brookside is an old neighborhood with large Craftsman-style homes, and I am sure there are many spirits roaming around there but, on this night, it would be a relative that I would see. 

After a Saturday evening at home having dinner with the family and playing Monopoly, my younger sister and I headed to bed in our shared room upstairs. Her bed was across the room from mine. It was dark that night with a bit of moonlight coming in through the windows. We were a little bit wound up and were just talking softly when suddenly a mist began to form about six feet in the air just beyond the foot of my bed. I just quietly watched it form into the head of a man with clear features. It had a narrow nose, high forehead, and piercing eyes which seemed to stare right through me. I kept my composure, curious about what this was that I was looking at, when the head began to talk. I could not hear anything but could clearly see words being formed by the mouth. It was speaking to me! 

At that point, I needed confirmation and asked my sister ""Do you see that thing floating at the foot of my bed?"" My sister opened her eyes and looked to see the same thing, only being a bit more fragile than me, she screamed. Then I screamed. My father and brother ran up the stairs, flipped on the light, and dad said angrily, ""What is wrong?"" The head disappeared when the light went on. I did not know if I should be scared or disappointed that it was gone. 

We explained what happened and my father asked me what the apparition looked like, then went downstairs to get a photo album that I had never seen before. He asked me to look through it and see if anyone in it looked like the head of the person I saw. Sure enough, after browsing through I stopped at a picture and said, ""That is him!"" It turned out that it was my father's father who died in 1950, six years before I was born. 

That was my ""in your face"" introduction to the spirit world. I have had many encounters with ghosts since then, but I will never forget the first."
"The House In Pennsylvania","Pennsylvania","Haunted Places","In 2005, while serving in the U.S. Navy, I took leave in between duty stations. At the time, I was engaged to a Sailor who lived in Pennsylvania, I'll call him Tim. I decided that I would visit him between visiting family in Michigan and Florida. Being that it wasn't too far from where my dad lived in Michigan, my dad and my stepmom drove me to Tim's house. Immediately upon pulling into the driveway, I was overcome with a sense of dread that I did not express to my dad or stepmom. 

The house was older, not well maintained, and was surrounded by weeds and untamed trees and bushes. It looked like a house you would see in a horror film. However, I really wanted to see Tim, so I sucked it up, wrote it off as nerves about being in an unfamiliar place, and went inside. The only way to describe what I felt when I went inside is to say that it felt like the house was bursting with negative energy. I felt like there were multiple spirits and honestly, the feeling was overwhelming. It almost felt like the house was alive; it was an absolutely awful feeling but now I was stuck. My dad was already gone and I didn't have a way to call him because he didn't have a cellphone. 

Tim was still at work so I was forced to sit in the house by myself for an hour or so, the entire time I literally felt like I was in danger. To add to that sense of fear, the house was incredibly dark (it was nighttime), and it was like the lamps in the house couldn't penetrate the darkness. Tim finally came home and we went to bed shortly after. I barely slept the first night because I didn't feel safe, however, the first night was pretty uneventful. 

The next night, I again struggled to sleep. I felt like something or someone was bent over me, staring down at me, it felt like their face was just inches from mine. It was absolutely terrible. I did my best to ignore it because I didn't want to act weird in front of my fiancé and somehow, I managed to fall asleep. The next morning, I woke up and started stretching out. As I was stretching, I realized my hair felt funny, like there was something heavy in it. I reached up to feel what it was, and realized that during my sleep, something or someone, had pulled back a chunk of my hair and clipped it with what looked like a little girls hairclip. It was a jelly clip, clear pink with glitter in it, and it clipped like a banana clip. It should be noted that there were no little girls in the house at any time while I was there. This freaked me out so bad, I still get goosebumps all these years later, I don't understand how I could have slept through someone pulling my hair back and clipping it. I asked Tim about it and he was as unsure as I was. It was so creepy and weird. 

The visit with my fiancé was overall pretty terrible, so bad in fact that I changed my flight and left several days earlier than planned. That sense of dread and fear lasted the entire time we were in that house and I'll never forget it. It was a feeling so awful, I've never experienced it before or since this event, even with numerous ""ghostly"" experiences. To add to this, my dad and stepmom felt that same sense of dread but they didn't say anything because I was an adult and they didn't want to interfere with my plans. My dad told me that he actually almost turned around to come get me because of the feeling he had (looking back, I wish he had). Tim and I ended up ending our relationship just after the visit. I wish I still had the address of the house because I would like to research its history."
"Not Alone-tragic Loss Warning","Michigan","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","On the evening of August 8th, 2022 around 6pm, my evening turned bad when I started having terrible lower abdominal pain, lower back pain, and pressure out of nowhere. I was 14 weeks pregnant and it seemed odd to me to be hurting like that already, so early on in my pregnancy. I sat down and figured I just needed to relax. An hour later I felt something and realized that I was bleeding. It became very heavy and I was terrified that I was going to hemorrhage to death. I went to Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak where I was told that I had to come alone, no visitors. I got the grim news once the ER staff performed an ultrasound and there was my baby on the screen, lying still with no heartbeat. 

I cried hysterically, wishing that I had someone there with me but all I had were the medical staff who told me that I could try again for another baby in the future. I wanted that baby. He was to be my first son. All night I cried as I lay there, helpless and alone. There was not much they could do but wait for me to pass the baby they said. I didn't sleep at all and it made me sad every time I heard the lullaby music played over the speaker system. I knew what that sound meant. A baby had been born, meanwhile there I was with a dead baby inside me.

I was admitted to the hospital and transferred to a room on the 3rd floor. After 12 hours of waiting and crying, it seemed like I was no longer alone in that room. The door to the room that I was in opened and closed on its own and there was an armchair in the room, near my bed. I felt a presence there. Finally when it was evident that I needed surgery, the door opened on it's own and closed on its own when the patient transporter arrived to get me and bring me to the OR. He noticed and said that was creepy. As I was being wheeled down the hall to the OR I got a glimpse of a tall, white man in scrubs standing there staring at me. He disappeared into thin air. I looked again but there were no doors he could've went into, only walls. I didn't see him in the OR. After I was moved from PACU to my room again, I felt a gust of cold air fly over me, like an invisible bird. I don't know who or what that was that was there, that presence, but it helped me feel less lonely."
"Graveyard Follower","Mississippi","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I've never been one to be too afraid to tell people my stories. Seeing paranormal activity runs in my family as much as some of us don't like it. Wasn't sure what story I should start with but, here's this one. It comes from my time on Keesler AFB in Biloxi, MS.

A friend of mine got fascinated by my apparent ""ability"" to provoke such activity. Just being around an area with a potential haunting being enough to wake something. He wanted to take me out to the local graveyard at night to do some ghost hunting. Primarily because his last attempt had turned up nothing. I finally agreed to go after a month of asking and we left that night for the graveyard.

We were joined by another friend of ours as we went on our way. As we got to the graveyard, it was already after dusk leaving just a few lamp posts lit. We walked mostly in the dark as he didn't want to ""ruin"" it with the flashlight. Anytime our hair raised, we felt something off, or thought we saw something, he snapped a picture.

Of these feelings, we felt more profoundly an unwelcoming presence further in the dark. As if we were encroaching far enough as is leading us to turn back around toward the gate on the other side. As we stood under the lamp post, my camera wielding friend and I practically shivered at the same time. Our third friend said he didn't feel anything but, we shared a look and snapped a picture of him.

He was confused as we took his picture but, his face in the picture was red with fury. We took some precautions at that point attempting to ward away what might be there. My camera friend, shivered vigorously and glared over his shoulder while I got the same shiver shortly after. We made to leave that side of the graveyard and a short time after the lamp post went out.

We made for the other side of the graveyard which lay across the road. On that side we found a grave that appeared to have been dug into and the cement casing broken. There was an immense melancholy while in its proximity, I told him not to take a picture there. As we made our way across, the other half of this side was accessible by passing under the bough of a massive tree. The darkness cast underneath that tree was so thick and foreboding none of us dared to cross under it.

We left the other half of the graveyard and made our way back to the dormitory via the late night gate. As we walked along the road, I got the feeling of being followed. Turning around it seemed I was right. Three streetlights back, a light would flicker out and back on, always three lights back. We made turns and crossed streets and still that singular light would go out and then the next. Even after we got back onto the base proper, it continued to follow our exact path.

When we got into the dormitory, we went our separate ways for the evening. I looked out my window on a disconcerting feeling and saw the light outside flicker out. For an hour, the light remained out before finally flickering back on. Meeting up again the following day, we went over the photos.

The photos contained a handful of spirit orbs, an old woman knelt before a grave stone, a pair of men standing where we weren't allowed further, and the aforementioned photo we looked at prior. Needless to say, after being followed I refused any further excursions. In later months, I witness a man in fatigues step up to my wall locker before fading into nothing. Only other thing to come of that was an admittedly bad idea now.

My friends came to my room to see if we could get that spirit's attention. Being amateur at best, we shouldn't have but curiosity does what it will. For a brief moment during the impromptu séance, my camera friend's expression became aggressive before saying a single phrase in a growling tone. ""I have to live with..."" We snapped him out of it as quickly as we could and that too became forbidden. 

Looking back, I'm more than willing to say, we played with fire and got lucky. Today, I'm much more cautious when dealing with these events."
"Shadow Man In The Fedora","Arizona","Shadow People","About 2am this morning I was woken up to my little dog barking in the other room. I yelled out of my bedroom for him to stop barking and come back to bed. He is a snuggler and is usually curled up next to me while sleeping. He came back, jumped up onto the bed, and sat staring towards the bedroom door. He was clearly agitated and seem to be in guardian mode. He suddenly sprang from the bed as if he heard something only he could hear and ran back into the other room where he continued barking. 

What I found odd was that I have a doggie door installed and he never went outside. If there was a cat or someone prowling about, he surely would have given chase. A lot of older homes in the Phoenix area have alley ways behind their yards. This had been used as a communal trash collecting area for the city, and from time to time some of the homeless will set up camp there. This still didn't explain why my dog was remaining in the house and not rushing into the yard.

After listening to him bark a bit longer, I decided to get up and investigate. To stay in stealth mode, I didn't turn on any lights. I made my way down to the other end of the house where my dog was barking in front of the sliding glass doors. I started to scan the yard from left to right. At first I didn't see anything but the outline of the bougainvillea growing against the back wall.

Then I saw it...

Standing off to the right side of my yard, close to where my bedroom is, was a tall dark silhouette of a man in a fedora-type hat. My heart started to race and the dog was barking his head off. It was standing completely still and appeared to be looking in my direction. All of the sudden it vanished. It didn't fade into nothing. It was simply there one second and gone the next. I thought, what the hell did I just see? I didn't get a good feeling from whatever this was. It felt foreboding. 

Somehow I managed to get back to my room, get under the covers, and after some time, fall back to sleep. My dog followed me in and didn't make a peep the rest of the night. In the morning I looked back outside through the sliding glass doors to see if in a half asleep state I could've mistaken lawn furniture or something else in the yard for the shadow. I had not. Even so, why was my dog going ballistic? 

Today I wondered if this could have been linked to a recent tragedy. Over Memorial Day weekend at the end of May, I lost the love of my life to an accidental shooting. My Dad is also terminally ill and I can't help but wonder if seeing this shadow man might be linked to either. Now I didn't write this looking for sympathy. Yes, it sucks but I'm really curious to what this shadow was and why it decided to hang out in my yard last night. If anyone has any idea, please let me know."
"Returning To This Site After Almost 2 Years Of Absence","New York","A Haunted Life","It's been over a year since I last visited this site. And reading back through my old posts, I'v realized I've missed one or two of my childhood experiences... So I'm going to correct that, and start posting again... But let's rewind things a bit. I've been gone so long, I feel like I need to reintroduce myself and where my home (all of my experiences so far have happened within my home).

My name is Nicole. I'm a 27 year old artist living in Upstate New York. My house was built in 1902. It was constructed by the same man who built the house next door. The house next door was the man's personal home. If you dig down a foot around the edges of my yard, you'll come across a layer of fire place ash. Dig below that, and shards of porcelain, so well preserved that you can still see the gold and silver details, will start to come up.

When we first moved in, there was an old carriage (complete with feed trough) barn in our backyard. Unfortunately, the barn had not been maintained, and had become too dangerous to enter. My Father was forced to demolish it.

We have also had to do a lot of work on our home. We had to remove all the horsehair plaster we found in our walls, because it created too many drafts. We've also had to replace most of the windows, as well as all of the original wallpaper. Most of my ""being watched"" feeling, is around my Dad's office (the former front parlor), the upstairs bathroom along the wall shared by the toilet and shower, in front of the door leading to the basement, and in front of my bedroom door. Sometimes the feeling of being watched gets so bad, I can't turn my back on the area of the house the feeling seems to be the originating from. 

It's also important to note, that my town was the site of two military encampments. One during the French and Indian War, and the second during the War of 1812. The land itself was purchased from the local tribe of Native Americans in the 17th century. There are stories, and physical evidence of Native American raids, throughout the town. The nearby city (I could literally walk to it if I wanted to), is known for it's haunted locations. It sits on the original location of a 16th century outpost. There was one winter when the French came down from Canada and attacked the outpost. They killed or captured more then half the population. Then, while trekking to the nearest colony, the population was halved again, as the settlers were forced to walk through the wilderness in their nightclothes. The people who died in this attack are buried in a nearby cemetery. There are even stories of statues in the cemetery moving on their own.

I'm not sure if this has any effect on my house though.

All right now on to the main event!

 (The dreams described in this story started right when I was around 8-10 years old) 

 When I was a kid, I was a bit more ""in tune"" with the paranormal then most people. I had everything from feelings of impending doom so intense they would deprive me of a good night's rest, usually just a day or two before a major disaster (for example, I had this feeling the night before 9/11, and the night before Hurricane Katrina), I even had at least one out of body experience (let me know if you want to hear that story. I'll post it in the comments). In fact, most of my more intense paranormal experiences happened when I was a kid.

 For instance...

Have you ever heard of the Backrooms? That maze of nondescript rooms and hallways that seems to repeat itself over and over again. A place with no windows, no doors, and no obvious way out?

A Place where you always feel like you're being watched.

Just a Creepypasta Right? Just some strange story you read online. Nothing to worry about. It isn't real...

It's real... And I've been there... Or at least to some version of it... I have to be lying right? After all, I'm just some random person on the internet. You don't know me, and I don't know you. But I'm not lying. I promise you.

Before I being to tell my Backrooms story, I have to give you a basic layout of the house, as it will be important in just a little bit. When you approach our house from the street you'll notice that it's basically on the top of a small hill. You have have to go up two steps just to get onto our property. Then it's another small set of stairs onto our front porch, and another step up into our home. When you enter our front door, you enter into what my family calls our ""front hallway."" Basically it's a pretty good sized room separated from the rest of the house by a pair of beautiful French doors. To the left is the main staircase to the second floor, and to the right is my Dad's office (what used to be the front parlor.) 

For those of you who don't know there is a reason the living room, is well called a living room. Basically funeral parlors didn't become popular until about 1920. So when a person died, their funeral was held at home. And considering how the front parlor in my home is set up, I don't doubt that there was at least one funeral held there...

Anyway, after you pass through the French doors you come into the dining room, living room (separated by a good sized archway), and the short hallway leading to the basement door, the second staircase, and the kitchen (with a butler's pantry, and a small half bathroom attached). This second staircase is different. Where our main staircase is grand, and obviously meant to impress. This one... Isn't... It's dark, fully enclosed and hidden away behind a solid wood door.

If you walk up the main staircase, you will enter into moderately sized hallway. To the immediate right you'll come across the first (and arguably largest) bedroom. Down the hallway, and around a left turn are the other two bedrooms, a large bathroom, the door to the second staircase... And my Mother's sewing closet. My nursery (and childhood bedroom) was directly across from my Mother's sewing closet. I used to sleep with my door open, and was always terrified of my Mother's sewing closet. Its closed off by a set of double doors, but has always been something dark about it. To me, unless the light was on and my Mother was actively working in there, it always seemed like there was something, lurking inside... Something, evil.

I had a number of experiences in that room. Most of them not involving my Mother's sewing closet. There are a few experiences however that stick out in my memory. They are by far the strangest dreams I have ever had... Sigh, alright I said it... My strangest experiences revolve around dreams. Go on, poke some fun... I'll wait...

You done?

Ok.

So, all through out my childhood I would have strange experiences around the time I would be falling asleep, or shortly thereafter.

There are a few times where I can remember ""waking up"" in my Mother's sewing closet. In front of me was the narrow opening to a closet (this closet actually does exist, and it really is as creepy as I'm about to describe.) It wasn't so much a closet, as it was a gap between walls. All exposed rafters, an old, dirty linoleum floor, and no light source to speak of. In my dream I would always walk into the closet. I would walk, and walk, and walk. Never reaching the end. I would turn either left or right, and climb through a little hole in the wall. What I saw on the other side, still weirds me out. I actually try to not think about these dreams as much as possible.

Anyway, I would enter into what looked like a near perfect replica of my own home. Only it was massive, seemed to go on for ever, and everything was pure white. What was strange though, was no matter where I went in that ""other house"" I could never find my own room. It was like it didn't even exist. Where the door would be, there would be nothing... In fact, no matter which hallway I took, I almost always ended up back in the main area of the house.

The first few times I had this dream, I felt completely safe. It was just me, this weird as heck house, and a childish need to explore. When the dream was about to end, I would always end up climbing back through the hole, back through the closet, and into my Mother's sewing closet.

But then it changed... The more I dreamed of that place, the more degraded it became. What had once been a pure white, had turned into a dirty, sickly yellow. The place had once been consumed by a soft white light. That glow was long gone. In its place were dingy flickering lamps, that seemed to create more shadows then they did light...

I went from loving the thrill of freedom and exploration, to becoming almost to scared to move. I would still explore, but I felt like I was being watched. Like I was being hunted even... Those dreams would end with me running for the hole, and escaping my Mother's sewing closet as though someone had set my backend on fire...

Thankfully, I haven't had a dream like this in years... For which I am very glad... Every time I think of what I ""saw"" I can't help but shudder.

I'll share the stories of my other experiences eventually."
"New Store? It's Haunted","Nevada","Haunted Places","I worked on the 3700 block 0f Las Vegas Boulevard for about 4 and a half years. I didn't work for the casino itself, but a third party vendor. We faced the fountains. 

Vegas always tears down and builds again. There really isn't anything old in the city, but that does not mean once it's gone it's gone forever. After about a month of working I noticed that I'd always see the back of a woman's head. She was blonde, about 5'5"". She wasn't really there. I'd always just catch a glimpse of her and then she'd be gone. The funny thing is is that she was shopping in the woman's section of the store. I'd tell any coworker who'd listen to me, but was always brushed off as the ""weird"" guy who talked about the paranormal. 

This location was the biggest in the shopping area. About 1500 square feet of shopping space plus an additional 1100 square feet of stock rooms where merchandise was kept. The stock rooms were split into 4 different sections. Each section did have a door separating it from the others. In one of the sections that was farthest from the sales floor that we called the Shoe Room. Everyone would get a creepy feeling and tried to spend the least amount of time back there. I didn't mind it because it was a quiet area and one could ""hideout"" from management.

Quarterly, I worked over night shifts to reset the floor and make sure all new pieces were showcased. I worked these shifts frequently. It was nice seeing the city empty and lit by all the lights. Every shift went on, and no reports of anything strange occurring. 

Then it happened, out of no where and totally unexpected. During this particular shift, it was only the visual manager and myself working for a few hours. It was around 2:30am. I was in the Shoe Room about 7 feet up on a ladder grabbing some shelving, singing to myself. I heard my name being called. ""Johan! Johan!"" I called out a ""WHAT?!"" However, I had no response. I was thinking since I heard my name being called that the manager was in the stock room near by. I called out again but I heard nothing in return. I walked out to the floor and called out ""what"" again. I then saw the manager walk from the other side of the store asking what I wanted. I was a little confused because she was the one asking. She heard her name being called out while I was in the Shoe Room. A heavy air fell over the sales floor once we both realized that none of us were calling out to each other. 

A few months later we had to downsize the location. Knowing that the woman's side and Shoe Room were going to a new restaurant coming was a relief to me; knowing that most of the paranormal areas were not going to be included in this ""new"" location"
"Windy City Haunting","Illinois","Haunted Places","I am not much of a writer but I believe that this story deserves to be told. I am the type of person who has always searched for paranormal experiences. I used to work as a ghost walker (took people on tours of haunted sites in my town) and I collect books on bigfoot, ufology and I also read tarot cards. My grandmother also believes she is a psychic, so I have truly been around the supernatural my whole life. That being said, I am also a skeptic and I like to find rational explanations to supernatural experiences whenever I can. This story is about one of those times in which I was left feeling that the veil between the living and the dead isn't as thick as some would believe. 

 In March of 2019, my girlfriend and I travelled from Toronto to Chicago to attend a work conference at one of the many older hotels found in downtown Chicago. The flight was brief, and thankfully customs gave us no troubles. We took the train from O'Hare to the Loop and made sure to stop at the Nutella coffee shop before checking in to our hotel. The check-in was uneventful, and we were amazed to discover how many of our favorite movies had been filmed in this hotel. We walked up and down the staircases many times and took many pictures. We were especially excited to meet the CEO of our company on the elevator BEFORE the conference! Everything was going great and we were very excited to be there. 

 The conference was to take place over two days and we were set to attend workshops on each of those days. The first encounter we had in our hotel was smelling cigarette smoke coming from outside our room before opening the door. Neither of us smoke, so we were surprised and a bit concerned to have this happen. We nonetheless went about our day and attended our workshops. 

The second encounter was more unnerving. While unpacking our clothes we both witnessed the light in our closet turn on by itself. There is no way either of us did this and I would be very surprised if it was an electrical problem. We both nervously laughed about it and joked that our room must be haunted...

 The next morning... At around 5am... My girlfriend and I were both awakened to the sound of a woman crying from inside our bathroom. We were both too scared to even acknowledge it to each other and we both slept through it. I to this day think that our room was in fact haunted and that we experienced a spirit from another world. Part of me wanted to reach out to the entity and to try and help her. I feel that the more paranormal experiences you encounter the less afraid you become. I truly hope to one day be able to help these spirits and help them find resolve in the afterlife. Thank you for reading."
"The Spirits Of The Old Jail","Florida","Ghost Hunting","With a story like this, where exactly do I start? I have always held an interest in the paranormal, and this one evening in St. Augustine, I decided I would attempt to perform a paranormal investigation and get my toes wet, and see what it was all about. After all what was the worst that could happen right?

Well I went ahead and signed up and listened to the leader initially tell us about the tools that we would be using and explaining what type of activities other people have experienced, and was led inside the old jail, and shown some photographs that people have caught on location, and was told some key phrases that others have noticed would bring out a reaction from the spirits, and armed with that knowledge, I went ahead and grabbed some equipment and went out into the old jail, to see what was hiding in the shadows for me to locate.

Now, I did have a spirit box, and I had been warned about the crawler, and decided that the first location I would go to check out would be the location of solitary confinement. Mostly because in the back of my mind, my thoughts are that if there was somewhere holding a lot of energy it should be down there, where people were held by themselves, and also, that happened to be the location of where the death row was, as prisoners waited to go out to the gallows. Makes perfect sense that there should be some energy there right?

 I definitely was in for a treat down there to be perfectly honest. As I was recording and running my spirit box, I happened to notice that spirit orbs started to frequently fly by me. Especially once the name of the sheriff that ran the jail was mentioned, however to my disappointment, not much was coming through the spirit box, so maybe I wasn't asking the right questions. However, I did capture on camera, the sounds of feet shuffling, that I had heard with my own ears, and later on, when reviewing footage, heard a growl off to the side on camera.

To be fair, I never felt quite alone in this location, as I always felt like someone was watching me, or standing next to me. All that led down to one burning question in my mind as I left that location that night. What secrets are hiding in those walls, and what sort of evidence can I find if I was to return one day and reinvestigate?"
"What A Surprise Conformation","Florida","Family / Friends Visits","Let me start by saying I am a true believer in signs from our loved ones that have passed over to the next realm. I don't believe in God and such so I use realm as a way to describe the next phase of life. I used to believe but my faith was shaken and broken. And no one can give me a suitable explanation for my issue so it will never be restored. That is different story than we share here.

 I recently started painting... I will admit I got some practicing to do LOL. Anyway, my mom passed 5/5/2020. She was all alone due to COVID. I still feel so bad about that. But her favorite flower was a daisy. Plain and simple but beautiful daisy. 

The morning of 7/3/2022 I had gone to the gym and when I got home around 11 AM I told Alexa to play ""Memories"" by Maroon 5, one of my favorite songs by them. As I sat home alone and decided to paint a daisy and do it as an ""in memorial of"" tribute on it as well. On the painting, it says ""You Are Kept Alive By Our Memories With Love"". 

When I got finished around 2:30/3:00 PM, I posted it on my Facebook page with a little ""message"" to her saying ""I hope you like it""!

About 20 minutes later I sat there watching Fact or Fiction, my sons and I enjoyed when they were younger, and got the surprise message from my mom.

Now sometimes if someone on TV says something close to Alexa, she will ""bloop"" like she is turning on but never say anything. 

This time Alexa came on with her ""bloop' and said that was Memories by Maroon 5. Mind you again, I had listened to it about 4-ish hours before that. It is the first time she had done that. 

I said ""Thank you for letting me know that you seen and liked the painting I did for you, Mother"" 

What a nice surprise I had just when I needed it too.

I was going to add a picture of the painting but can not figure out how."
"2 Encounters In 1 Night","Utah","Haunted Places","For some backstory I was 9 when this happened, I remember this very vividly because it was my first time ever experiencing something like this and it also happened the day before my birthday so on May 24th. It was around 1am, everyone was sleeping and I just barely woke up (I fell asleep earlier in the day).

For more context, I was sleeping beside my sister; we shared the same room (also the room was dimly lit because of my nightlight). Note that our door was open, so we can see into the little ""hall"" that led to my parent's room which was kind of diagonal to us. 

Anyway, I just laid there in the dark because there was literally nothing I can do, except try forcing myself to sleep again. After 6 minutes or so trying to go back to sleep, I looked into the hall. There was a transparent man standing in the hall looking back and forth to my bedroom and my parent's bedroom. 

This guy was also holding a briefcase, it looked like he was a business man; his ""hair"" was done neatly it was a side part and he was wearing a suit that had patches on the elbows. He didn't notice me yet, I was so scared and hiding behind my sister while peeking at him. However, he must've heard me crying because then he noticed me. This sounds silly, but in real life it was so scary: his head started going crazy, it was moving all sorts of directions. I cried silently and hid under the blanket (my sister is a deep sleeper so she didn't hear me lol it sucked). 

I fell into a short nap and woke up again. I'm unsure what time this was, because as soon as I woke up I had the scariest feeling that someone was watching me. I was right. The man that was in the hallway disappeared, and now there was something else here too. It wasn't a someone though, it was something. It was this insanely dark but also transparent ""cloud/blob"" watching me from the ceiling. It could shapeshift, and it glided to the corners of the ceiling and then over me. If it had eyes, I could not tell because my own eyes were blurred from my tears lol. 

It was right above me, on my ceiling and it gave off the worst vibes ever. I cried myself to sleep (thankfully). I do believe that house was haunted with multiple spirits because we've heard a little girl singing there before mainly in the bathroom, super heavy footsteps going down the stairs, banging, gives off unsettling vibes and my siblings + friends and I have seen a woman's face on the wall before (that's for a different time though). She was also ghastly and transparent like the man I mentioned in this story. 

To close, now that I look back on it I think it kind of makes sense now. A little girl singing, a business man and a woman... Maybe they were a family? I have no idea what the black ""Cloud"" was or what it used to be. I do have more ghost stories because living in an unsettling home didn't stop there. Those stories are for another time though."
"The Haunted Moving Dog Statues","Iowa","Haunted Items","My cousins came over 3 years ago from Lowa to visit us and decided to tell us about a story when they caught a ghost on camera and about some dog statues they used to have that moved on their own. 

They said that they got them from a sale at a flea market or yard sale, I forget but the original owners of them didn't want them anymore so they started to sell them because something terrified them so bad. 

 I have been to his house and seen his dog statues and I always felt some odd bad vibe and energy about them, even my siblings felt it too while they were around them. I sometimes felt like they stared at me and even everyone agreed. One of my cousins said that one of them creeped her out because she swears one moved his head to look at her and then back to normal.

 Then one day my aunt actually caught one moving whenever she looked away and back. She decided to throw them away in a plastic bag and when my cousin asked what was in the bag, she was like "" don't touch them, it's the dog statues, I'm throwing them out now since they scare me and give off a bad vibe."" 

They also said that they heard barks and growls at night when they had them. I felt really spooked when they told me that. Like those statues were definitely possessed either by a dog or a demon or a ghost that is attached to them but they're gone now. Those statues really looked realistic."
"Annoying Phantom Cats","Arkansas","Pets / Animals","I have enjoyed reading Phantom Cat stories here. My personal experience has been somewhat disturbing.

Phantom Cats are not new to me, but I never called them that before now. I have felt them for many years, and occasionally seen one out of the corner of my eye. At first, they were more surprising than disturbing. I thought it was kind of neat! I was not disturbed at all. However, this has recently changed.

Several weeks ago, for the first time in a while, I began to feel the Phantom Cats again. In addition, I was again seeing the ""creepy crawlies"" in shadows. They are like Daddy Long Legs, but with hundreds of legs, kind of fuzzy and legs wiggling. They grow. I have never seen them leave the shadows, but I do see them on the periphery.

 Well, when I began to feel the ""cats"" once more, it quickly progressed to feeling like the ""creepy Crawlies"" were climbing on to my feet and lower legs - that's what I thought anyway. There were multiple ones at the same time. They would bite my toes, and I could feel it very acutely, and with associated pain. I was scared of them. 

 I tried praying them away, I would ""kick"" them off, but they would persistently return. They would only go away if I were to fall asleep. 

 I thought perhaps this was some psychosis associated with peripheral neuropathy. As such, I tried taking more Gabapentin at bedtime. At first, I thought it was helping. That did not last long, and they returned in force.

 I literally thought I may be possessed by some evil spirit. These incidents even began to occur when I was sitting or lying in my recliner and would move with me if I got up and walked around. At times I felt a heaviness from the creatures, and always a sense of feet of some kind walking on my lower extremities. 

One night, I though ""Oh my goodness - they're Cats! We once had a cat that would nibble at my toes at night. This, I thought, was an exacerbation of that. I felt much better, thinking these were phantom cats rather than the creepy crawlies.

 To stop the biting, I began to wear shoes to bed, but that did not help. I could still feel the bites. I just wanted it to stop. I tried taking a sedative and holding off on getting in the bed until I was very nearly passed out. That helped, but sedatives tend to work a very long time with me, and I would oversleep. 

I feel I am back to square one. I am afraid to get into my bed or recliner. I am experiencing progressive sleep deprivation and psychologically I'm screwed. I fear discussing it with my doctor for fear of being locked up or something. I'm not generally ""crazy"" - but this is slowly eating at me, and it is only getting worse by the day. I do not know what to do. Tonight, it started in my bed, so I moved to the recliner. They followed me. It seems this time there were even more cats than usual, and they followed me when I got up and went to the kitchen for a snack. That has never happened before. That's why I am writing this, hoping for some advice."
"The Ghost Experiences Of My Life","Colorado","A Haunted Life","Ever since I was a kid, I experienced various ghost experiences. Maybe not too many. One of my earliest experiences was witnessing my mother astral project when I was 6. If that even counts as a ghostly experience of some kind. This occurred in the house I grew up in Wheat Ridge, Colorado. I am lying in bed wide awake, and all of a sudden see a ghostly vision of my mother float through the hallway. I'm freaking out a bit, so I called out to her. She responded from the next bedroom, and told me that everything was ok, and she knew what was going on.

Outside of that experience, my first experience came when I was 8, in the same house where I witnessed my mother astral project in Wheat Ridge. I was lying in bed wide awake, and all of a sudden I see a shadowy figure walk from our front door to the kitchen area, which was a straight shot. I heard no door opening and closing, nor did I hear the floor creaking from someone walking. The next day I asked my parents if they were up the previous night to go outside. They both said no.

In 2008, when I was 31, I was at a friend's house in Westminster, Colorado. He was telling us about a ghost that haunts his house. I started playing the ghost hunter. I asked questions like ""if your in this room now, give us a sign."" Sure enough you would hear a tap or 2. There was another night when we were hanging out at his house, and kept hearing tapping. Another friend pulled out his camera to take a picture from where the sound was. I couldn't believe my eyes what the camera caught. It was a ghostly image of a man wearing Viking attire. He even smiled at the camera too.

There is a road in Thornton, Colorado, that has confirmed history of hauntings. It is about 10-15 minutes from my current house. It is called Riverdale Rd. There is one story where a car will pull up behind you and want to try to race you. Supposedly if you race them you will see the car disappear, and it may lead to your death. I have numerous experiences on Riverdale Rd, so I am going to talk about each experiences in separate paragraphs.

The first time I went on Riverdale Rd. Was in 2008 around Halloween. I drove my car. We were trying to look for a tree where witch hangings occurred. On the way trying to find it, there was a pick up truck that had dirty windows. Almost like a random truck following you in a horror movie. We realized we passed the tree, so we pulled over. The truck eventually passed us. We found the tree and pulled over and got out for a solid 20-30 minutes. It was creepy. The tree was on the side road. A dirt road lead to a dairy farm from where the tree was. You can almost picture witches walking on the road towards the tree. We were hanging out and all of a sudden heard some girls laughing, almost fairly close too. There was a little ditch off to the left of the dirt road. We kept seeing a lady in a white dress appear. My friends wanted to go. I was rather curious and wanted to stay. Remind you, I was driving. That night when I got to my house I heard a strange click in my car as I shut it off. From that moment, that click would happen from time to time until 2016, when I got rid of it. Almost 8 years.

After our first experience on Riverdale Rd. We went again the next night. Not much action happened. The only thing that was strange, was when we got to the tree, we heard this strange continuous sound coming from the tree.

Another friend and myself went again a couple days later. This time we were kind of curious, and wanted to drive closer to the dairy farm. We turned around real fast. We saw a ghostly image of a man floating towards us wearing an apron and holding up a knife.

The last time I seen action on that road was in 2009, the next year. We got lost trying to look for the tree. We noticed a car speeding up behind us, before eventually passing us. We turned around, that same car sped up behind me, again went around me. We found the tree. We got out for a little bit. We then decided to drive down the road a little bit. We then saw a shadowy figure cross us. We backed out and left.

I married my wife in 2013. For our honeymoon we stayed at Colorado's premiere haunted attraction, the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park. It was strange, because I noticed as I took showers in our room, I would get this eerie feeling I was being watched. There was one night, I was lying in bed. I was lying on my stomach. I felt pressure on my back. Like someone pushing me. I quickly turned over and looked at my wife. It wasn't her.

We took a ghost tour at the Stanley. I thought it really cool. There was a story of a maid that died in a fire. She would haunt the hotel and try to break apart couples if she thought were not properly married. I felt she could have been the one that may haunted me.

We went in this music hall type auditorium. There was a basement were various rooms that people had actually stayed. There was a room where a gentleman stayed. He had some mental health issues. Each time we went in that room, we had to announce who we were, and that we were coming in. As you walked in the room, you can sense the uncomfortness.

Across the hall there was a room where a runaway girl died in a fire in 1969. Her name was Lucy. One of the ways she haunts the room is her ghost would close the door by itself. I found it really intriguing, and at the same time a bit skeptical. What if the door is spring loaded? What convinced me that this was real, was there was a moment when I was out of the room. As I walked back in, the door started closing. That instant, as I approached the door, it stopped so I can walk in.

In February and March, I came in contact with two mediums to make contact with my parents who have passed on. I felt both experiences were successful. No Ouija boards or tarot cards were used. During the session I had in March, I made contact with a third person, in which something interesting happened during that connection. I am not going to talk about the medium experiences in it's entirety, just going to talk about the initial ghost experience at hand, as well as a detailed description of why I wanted to connect with this third person.

In March, I was visiting family in Farmington, New Mexico during this session, so it was conducted via Zoom. I did it in my Goddaughters' bedroom. It was the only place where I could find privacy. I made a connection with my mother, as well as a second person. That person was... Marilyn Monroe. However, I have my reasons why I am going to refer to her as Norma Jeane.

The reason I brought her up was what really drew me to her? I all of a sudden grew a liking of her, within weeks after my mother's passing in 1998. My mother had nothing against her, just boom out of nowhere. I was 21 at the time. I had seen a picture of her and I fell in love since. A picture of her as a brunette to be exact. My father thought it was weird, I thought it was weird.

I had numerous of dreams with her in them, all of which almost randomly. One of them was her as a brunette. It was weird, it didn't necessarily look like her, but my brain registered that it was the image of her. Another dream I was walking somewhere and happened to see her. Words were exchanged, in which I can't remember if it was her or me that said it, but I heard ""see you later."" I remember waking up and falling asleep again, sure enough the prophecy was true, I saw her again. In fact I seen her 2 more times that night.

In 2007 I had the honor of seeing her crypt, as well as the infamous mirror at the Roosevelt Hotel that was in the room which she rented when she resided at the hotel.

From what I told the medium, and I wasn't as detailed as I was here, she came to the conclusion that to me, I communicate to her through God (or visa versa). The medium had thought this was really cool. I wanted to follow through more into this, but didn't think about it. I asked someone who I work with who had paranormal experiences. Basically she stated that Norma Jeane could be my guardian angel.

It's funny because, around the time I met with the first medium, I thought about this. I randomly did a web search of guardian angels. One struck my eye and I opened it. According to what the website said a person's guardian angel is based on the time you were born. I clicked my birthdate and it described what my guardian angel was. It even had a picture of the image what they may appear as. I thought Wow, was I meant to see this! It was a picture of a blonde woman in a red dress. There are perhaps thousands of photographs of Norma Jeane wearing red dresses, swimsuits, sweaters, even as a brunette.

During our conversation about Norma Jeane, I heard something fall from behind me. Remind you, I was on my Goddaughter's bed. All there were was stuffed animals on the bed. When I looked back, it looked like nothing was tweaked with. When I heard the item fall, it seemed to me that it wasn't a mechanism to scare me, but to say hi, I see you.

The next day I told the medium about that, she thought it was really cool.

On Easter I was talking with a cousin about the experience I had with Norma Jeane. I didn't necessarily tell her who it was, I showed her a picture. She had a gut feeling that was who I was talking about. I gave her some clues regarding Norma Jeane. I didn't mention any movies, nor did I say she was blonde. My cousin had thought I said blonde.

After my three medium experiences, I became more convinced that some mediums are honest and are able to make solid connections with loved ones and other people as well."
"College Dorm Fright","Georgia","Haunted Places","If you want to go to any place that is haunted, just go to the small city of Savannah, Georgia. It's teeming with haunted life; you can't escape it when you're there; every square inch of that city is haunted; and it makes sense since it's one of the oldest towns in the United States. The locals would knowingly live side by side with these spirits as if they're residents nonchalantly. I once saw an object move on its own next to a cashier and he just casually move it back and said, ""Hey, ghost of Kevin, stop moving my stuff already."" The city even thrives off of its paranormal attraction with bus and nightly tours. 

I went to college there as a hard skeptic, to come out as a total believer. (Fun fact: My first dorm was formerly a coffin factory, that's how weirdly macabre this little city can be) 

I had MANY ghost stories from that city in my four years there, but I'll tell one of them that still gives me the creeps to this day.

One night in my dorm, I woke up around 2 am and I needed to use the bathroom. As I went out across the hall to go, I saw someone at the corner of my eye coming out from their room and started walking towards the other bathroom on that side. I didn't think much of it and thought it was my dorm-mate who just happened to go at the same time. She tends to stay up really late to finish assignments anyhow. I did my business and started to walk back only to see her walking back like me.

I turned to look and wave at her, but stopped dead in my tracks... And so did this person.

This girl wasn't my dorm-mate. 

She had red hair, pale features and she was wearing this large t-shirt that covers her down to her knees. What's extremely eerie was the fact she stopped at the same time when I turned to look at her, but she wasn't looking at me. She was looking right towards the room where my dorm-mate would be. I started to wonder if the door leading to the bathroom had opened to begin with...

I got tense, and quickly went into my room to shut the door and lock it. 

It took me a moment and I decided it was just late night fogs and I imagined it, or it was a friend of hers. (A peculiar friend she has...) However, my door started to violently shake!

Someone was trying to open the door in a hurry. I was startled and I called out to my dorm-mate if that was her. 

No answer.

I decided to open the door to see that no one was there.

I felt freaked out of course, but I just wanted to think it was just my mind playing tricks with me, them playing a prank, or I was just fatigued. I eventually went back to sleep but I was awoken again by something unknown. I felt something wasn't right. I was about to turn my lamp back on until I saw something at the corner of my eye again. And it was in front of my door in my room. 

Obviously I was scared now, and I thought it was a good idea to look right at where I supposedly saw someone, and I did. 

It was the same girl, staring at me and she had these terrifying sad, pit-black eyes. I yelled in shock and switched on the lamp to find her gone right after. It wasn't long until my dorm-mate in my hall came out and asked if I was okay. I was confident enough to tell her what I saw, but she didn't know what to think.

I couldn't go back to sleep that night.

Later, I decided to ask my dorm-mate across the hall about what happened. When I described it to her, she immediately froze and she looked a little scared herself. She told me, ""I saw her too. To be honest, I did some research on my own time about any significant hauntings in our dorms. I found a case where a female student committed suicide in my room where I stay in...""

 (Sadly, there are cases of students committing suicide notoriously so every year attending this college) 

To this day, it makes the hairs from the back of my head stand just thinking about it. 

But I do hope that this spirit finds peace..."
"Shadow Person In The Family","Texas","Shadow People","I don't know where to put my experiences, out of paranoia that I will be categorized as a lunatic. Ironically, I had a history of being a hard skeptic who mocks anything that is paranormal, supernatural... Anything that is spiritual. 

But I know it's because I don't want to give it attention out of fear -- and I don't want to see visions again. 

Seeing visions and these entities was very confounding and irritating for me as a child. (I tried testing if I was schizophrenic, but no.) It also came with hearing them, feeling them and even catching their scent for just as long, but the ones I'd like to talk about today are shadow people. They were the first real, vivid experiences I knew weren't just figments of my imagination. (As much as I wish it was.) 

I remember they came in groups at night but there was one who was darker than the very shadows themselves. The darkness of this entity was so dense that light seemed to be absorbed on contact to it, nor can the light reflect to escape its figure. I would see it come in through the light of the bathroom door -- like directly in the light so I know it wasn't just shadows playing tricks. Its feet would crunch against the carpet floor as it moves around my bed, never taking its eyes off of me. It was tall, but it would slink down behind the foot of the bed where its head would peek out. This one and those around it would give off emotions of sheer trepidation. If I move, if I don't pretend to sleep, it will be right there getting closer. Alongside these wide awake terrors, I would have horrible nightmares back to back every night. 

I decided to change it up a bit. I wanted to create a truce to end it, so I would offer it cookies under my bed as a child. Of course, none were taken or I assumed my father would simply know about it and eat them. Either way, it was symbolic that I just wanted to ease my stress.

However, one night when I was seven, I dreamt that I jumped out of bed and confronted the shadow person. I started to slowly suffocate him until he dissolved. Ever since that dream, the shadow people stopped visiting. Until I met another shadow person years after in a new home over 15 years later...

It was a very familiar aura coming up the stairs of that house. In the shadows, I saw a dense blackness and I know it was watching me. 

It gives off the same eerie, air thickening sensations but I don't sense it was a threat. It would stare at me in its eerie glory of being the darkest of shadows, and its ever-moving figure... But it kept its distance. 

Something in me told me, ""You have far more power now, and it knows it.""

I was also getting into witchcraft after finally realizing nothing can help me truly escape from seeing or interacting with spirits/entities. Etc. And I don't want the fear of it to control me anymore.

I set up wards, looked at him in the darkness of my house one night and said, ""You try anything, I'll inflict harm and throw you out in the cold."" I don't know what good that'll do but in my observation, they seem to dislike direct confrontation. Or, any indication that you have any intense will to fight back. 

Over time, I didn't pay too much mind with this entity and just allowed it to wander around. No ill-happenings has taken place, no indications that there were any strange mood drops, and the presence felt less intrusive despite that it's still prevalently there.

I had friends whom are into mediumship immediately pick him up in my home but they also didn't feel any really threatening other than the usual eeriness. 

One night, I felt a dip in my bed before I went to sleep. I felt and heard someone breathing too in staccato breaths. I didn't really want to look over at what it was other than I knew who it was. It just simply laid there next to me, and I can just imagine it was staring. I decided to say, ""You can lay here if you want, but anything else, I will hurt you."" I was actually more scared than I try to let on. After researching on the phenomenon of shadow people, they seem to feel and take that fear in as an advantage. But seemingly in this case, it was nervous in return. 

The turn was when I had a dream (or I astral projected) I went out of my body and started to wander about my own home. Before I started to venture beyond my front door, I saw it stepping into my view and I heard it's raspy, distorted voice echo, ""Go back to your body. It's dangerous out there without it."" With that, it escorted me back into my bedroom and I woke up. 

 Since then, when I have ""dreams"" of leaving my body, I see the entity coming in to block me and send me back and tell me it's for my safety.

I decided it wasn't going to hurt me, and I made the decision to set up some fresh black tea upon my altar for him, as a sign of truce for now. 

In the reality of this, I am still readily available to the idea that I am just delusional, it was tricking me, or it was a figment of my imagination. During times when I want to give up the notion it's real, I had people claim they saw a really dark humanoid shadow coming and going by the blink of an eye in my home -- without me telling them anything about it. 

Currently, for now, he is considered a Family member of my spiritual team. I will not give away his name other than he's grown to been actually a someone of comfort. However, for any entity or any person embodying a vessel, I won't let all of my guard down if anything else happens. 

I am still very perplexed about the concept of what is a shadow person, other than articles upon articles of supposed assumptions, or ""experts"" preaching they're demonic, guardians, extraterrestrials, or other. 

The only thing I care about is if it respects my boundaries and if it later shows other considerations, I will return the favor and I'll gain respect for it until further notice."
"There Is Another World","New Jersey","Misc","I have read almost all of these Ghost Stories and I felt the need to comment for all readers. I am also educated in certain fields that take into account the reality of God and the Heavenly courts. We are here on earth in a physical form but spirits do exists. Some are not good, most that try to contact humans are not good and some are in Purgatory looking for someone to pray for their souls. Aliens are only spirits that are not good but they are not from any planets, that's something people made up to explain them. 

Ouija Boards open doors to evil, don't use them. You have been warned. 

Now the only time I have really known a good spirit was here in reality.

My father was a hard working truck driver. He worked very hard all his life and was a very very quiet man that never complained and never bragged. He prayed the Rosary in his truck tween pick ups and called my mom every night before he left to drive home. He had two heart attacks and a stroke. That is what killed him, the stroke was the final time in the hospital where my family went to visit him the night he died at 62.

My two brothers were there, my sister stayed home. My mother was with us and we were having fun hugging and playing games with my dad to make him laugh. My father loved bread and wasn't allowed to have any; but there was a food cart outside his door that he saw and he motioned for my brother Tom to get him a buttered roll, which he did. 

He gave it to my dad who greedily tried to swallow it whole but a nurse peeked in and saw him and came in ""P, give me that roll, don't you dare eat it!"" she yelled. My dad threw it to my brother Chris and the nurse turned to him and said, ""Okay give it here!"" and Chris threw it to Tom and Tom threw it back to my dad who took a bite and the nurse was monkey in the middle, she wasn't laughing but we all were. My dad was in fine spirits and we were enjoying him.

After he took that one last bite he suddenly sat straight up and could move his paralyzed side and he looked 10 years younger and could speak too and he exclaimed with both his arms up in the air looking at someone up there on the ceiling, ""Mary!"" as if a woman was there named Mary. Then he fell backwards on his bad and was dead the second he fell back. The nurse rushed us out of the room and called code blue. My family and I knew he was gone and prayed it was Our Lady the Virgin Mary who came for him.

The hospital called us two hours later and told us he passed away but we knew it all ready for some reason. 

We are a small family and the next day many miracles happened. First was my mother coming to get my dad's body, she thought she would have to sell the house being my dad's insurance ran out 4 months prior to his death. She stood on billing line with my brother Tom when suddenly a very handsome very young Franciscan monk came over to them and spoke; he said, ""Kathrine, (my mother) and Tom, I don't want to you to worry, Katy (no one called my mom Katy but dad) about anything, P. Is all right and in a good place and everything will work out fine. So have no fear of anything and do not worry about your husband I gave him last Rites of the Church last night I spent the whole time with him."" Then he turned to my brother Tom and said, ""Tom it is noted that you took a year out of school to help your mother with your dad, that will be well for you."" Then he said, ""I have to run, I'm needed, let me bless you two. "" He blessed them then he ran way and just then ""Vala"" the nurse called from the billing counter and my mom was next. She walked up and gave in her papers and she received a bill that said she owed NOTHING, 0, Zip! My mother couldn't believe it and said, ""Is this right?"" and the nurse said, ""Why?, Do you want to give us money?"" My mom and brother left the window quickly.

 They asked the people behind them if they saw where the monk went and they said they saw no monk and no one else saw him either. My mother wanted to thank him so mom and my brother went up to the floor dad was last and asked the nurse for info on the monk that spent the night with her husband. The nurse said no monk was there and there wasn't a monk for a hundred miles. Mom went with Tom to the security department and there was never a monk on any of the lobby or floor cameras.

 They walked to the parking lot and at the exit was a beautiful statue of St. Anthony, my mothers lawyer. It looked just like the monk that blessed them they said. 

The next day at the funeral home, we sat there talking about dad, just four of us. We're only four people in our small family and suddenly about a hundred people started to walk in with wreaths and all kinds of flowers and food and they all told us about the wonderful things my dad did for them when he was alive. There were even Nuns my dad would walk home so they wouldn't get robbed at night. We never knew anything my father did, he never spoke about it, he never spoke much at all, he just prayed his Rosary and listened to classical music.

 My dad is with God in Heaven and Our Lady the Virgin Mary came to take him, we have no doubt as to this. Maybe this isn't a frightening story about evil or anger but spirits are real so if they feel bad or scary or evil they most likely are and you should avoid them. Get a Rosary have it blessed and you will never have anything to fear, not even death. Pray when a soul bothers you and it will find its way to the light."
"The Hollywood Roosevelt & Lost Luggage","California","Haunted Places","I will start off with an apology because it's quite a lengthy story with a fair bit of background information. 

This story may not seem as spectacular in comparison to some of the others, but as it might just be my first ever paranormal encounter I just had to share it and get some of your thoughts!

First off a little introduction. I'm a 27 year old male and I grew up in the city of Birmingham (England), I have always had an interest in the paranormal, but having never experienced anything personally, I have remained mostly skeptical throughout. I say mostly, as there was always an element of belief due to a story in which my Grandad experienced poltergeist activity. A story, he always described as an unexplainable experience, rather than a ghost story (even after him witnessing items being thrown across the room). 

Back in January this year, I found out I had won an incredible prize off of the back of a competition I'd entered in November 2021. The competition was centred around the release of Ghostbusters: Afterlife. 

The prize itself, included a 5 day trip to Los Angeles; flights, transfers, accommodation, a Sony studios tour, and a professional paranormal investigation onboard the Queen Mary! I was designated a prize manager, who ran through all of the T's & C's and worked with me to organize the lot! However, I never really noticed the lack of choice in regards to the accommodation! (More on that further on). 

Unfortunately, the Queen Mary investigation was unable to be booked for one reason or another, so me and my girlfriend chose an alternative option: Los Angeles: The Fame Kills Tour. 

Fast forward to Monday the 16th of May, when we started the trip of our lifetime!. Upon landing in Los Angeles Airport, we had the dreaded situation of our luggage not arriving with us! 

A few stressful hours at the airport, filling out forms and trying to get through to the airline via various phone numbers, we simply gave in to the fact we just had to get on with it! 

We arrived and checked in to our Hotel, The Hollywood Roosevelt. A beautiful hotel with amazing décor and a celeb filled history, not that it mattered too much to us as we had planned to be out exploring from early until late every day!

On Tuesday morning we had a call stating that our luggage had been found and that it would be sent to our hotel shortly after a flight arriving on Wednesday evening.

Skipping to the tour at 20:00, we set off on the short walk to meet our tour guide. We learned some interesting history about some of the buildings along the walk of fame and some famous hauntings reported in each. The tour eventually circled back to our hotel, which to our complete surprise, formed the final destination and grand finale of the tour! With a multitude of unexplainable stories, experiences, sightings and famous ghostly visitors, such as Carole Lombard and Marilyn Monroe reportedly residing within. 

Slightly excited from this new found info, we tried to visit some of the hotspots within the hotel. (Not sure what we were expecting), but of course, we didn't encounter anything.

After a busy day of various activities on the Wednesday, we arrived back at the hotel, to find that our luggage still had not arrived. The idea of late evening drinks in the bar, quickly turned into 'comfy clothes and bed'. 

At 5am I was woken up by the other half, asking if I had turned the TV on. Thinking I must have leant on the remote, I fumbled around the bed in search of it, eventually realizing it was still on the bedside table. (Outside of my arm reach). I switched the tv off placed it back on the table and lay back down... A few seconds later, the tv was back on. Dazed and slightly confused, I reached back over and switched it back off, not really thinking much of it. 

As soon as I hit the pillow, the tv was lighting up the room for a third time, at this point none of my thoughts were anything out of the ordinary. So I checked the remote buttons weren't sticking, I checked there weren't any additional remotes under the pillows or mattress and gently tapped the walls to see how thick they were. (solid! I certainly don't think the neighbours' remotes signal would have been getting through). After ruling those few things out, I made a joke that maybe this was our ghostly visit! Which of course was followed by eye rolls and skepticism. 

However, on the fourth time and (after my initial jokes) the tv turned on once again but this time, we watched on as the tv directly changed channels, it went down a number of times and then back up maybe one or two and back down once! As this is happening, I'm looking at the tv, then at the remote, back at the tv etc. Trying to think logically for any reasons as to why it happened again. Dumbfounded, I just switched it off again and hoped for the best. 

For the fifth time, it turned on again! This time however, I proceeded to just keep the tv on, proclaiming that whatever was going on, had beaten my stubbornness. We were wide awake and so we may as well just watch it! By this time I had ruled out as much as I could, (jokingly but not so jokingly) I commented that maybe our luggage had been delivered and this was some communication from a friendly visitor, letting us know. As soon as I had finished those words, the tv turned off to standby mode. (No sleep timer was on on the screen). 

Nothing more occurred after that but the sunrise, so after some chatter we were up and about getting ready for an early morning swim before we were due to hit universal studios! On the way down, we thought we would double check if our luggage had arrived. To our joy, there our bags were, stacked behind the reception desk, waiting for us to collect. As we didn't have any ID for proof on us, we thought we'd carry on and come back with it all after a swim. As I started to walk off, the other half turned back and asked the staff member if they knew the time they were delivered. I realized why she was asking and immediately traced back towards the desk. After a few taps on the computer she responded with, ""early this morning, around 5am"". 

Simultaneously, we looked at each other, with what probably looked like a mirrored facial expression, and explained to the lady that we had experienced some ""issues"" with our TV repeatedly turning on and off at that same time. With no surprise or hesitation she replied that it was likely one their many ""residential"" guests. 

We didn't stay in the pool long, so we went back to the room, my girlfriend jumped in the shower and off I went with our ID to get our stuff. When I returned, my girlfriend was just switching the shower off, so I can hazard a guess that she hadn't left the bathroom! Unsurprisingly, the tv was on, this time with just the main menu open. (which she denies having done whilst I was gone). 

At no other point during our stay did the the TV turn on or off, of it's own accord in the same manner as it did. The sceptic in me has thought of many theories, justifications and ideas but it all just comes back full circle, the probability of such coincidence after coincidence is just as mind blowing."
"The Little Girl's Doll","Ohio","Haunted Items","I was 7 years old, and just about to go into the 1st grade. I had just moved and knew no one. When I was younger I was obsessed with dolls, and for my 6th birthday, my grandma had gifted me a doll she had found at Goodwill. This doll was OLD, they no longer make dolls like her anymore, and I was thrilled. I would be the only one with this doll, and I already loved her. I named her Jamie, and I took her everywhere. 

I started noticing weird things about three months after I received Jamie. When I would be playing with her, I would hear the voices of people that weren't there, as a young child I mostly ignored the voices and would continue playing. These occurrences stopped for a couple of months and came back in full force about a month after my 7th birthday.

 I met a girl named Leah (name changed for privacy reasons) and invited her over to play. We had an extra room at that time because my mom was pregnant with my would-be second little brother. The room was set up as a nursery and was perfect for a playing house. Both Leah and I agreed that Jamie would be the oldest child, and a few of my younger dolls would be Jamie's younger siblings. Leah thought it would be fun to ""put Jamie in timeout"" for ""hitting her sister"". I agreed, we set Jamie in the crib facing the wall, grabbed both the other dolls, left the room, and closed the door behind us. We waited for a few minutes and reentered the room. Jamie was now sitting in the exact same place, but facing the door... Both Leah and I fled, leaving Jamie where she was, refusing to reenter the room.

 At that year's garage sale, we sold the doll to an antique owner, who promised to take good care of her. It still haunts me to this day, and I will never truly understand how it happened. The only other people in the house that day were my dad and my younger brother, who were in the basement when it happened. We were standing outside the door, so no one could have entered the room."
"Hospital Haunt In Cleveland","Ohio","Haunted Places","It was around 1994-95 when I got hired at one of the major hospitals in Cleveland, Ohio (leaving the name out, but there are several).

I had a medical background & was hired for the Radiology department. Most of my experience was in patient care and secretarial work.

However, I adjusted quickly to radiology. I learned very fast.

After the first year I began to hear stories about a ghost in the basement radiology file room. Every hospital has file rooms where the older patient film cases are stored before they leave the facility to go to a special warehouse for continued storage. Back then we had actual hard copy x-ray films-does 'anyone' remember actual x-ray films? This was several years before going digital. After that point we would burn patient CDs for them to take to Dr. Appointments, or surgeries.

I would, quite frequently, go down to the basement to pull basket loads of film folders for patients to pick up for upcoming appointments, surgery cases, or doctors' case presentations.

I was in the basement file room pulling a lot of films for an upcoming presentation. All I had on my mind was getting all those folders pulled so I could get back up to the office to do some of the other work that was waiting for me. I was quite accustomed to an occasional co-worker, or physician coming in to ask for assistance in looking for something.

 I was busy filling the basket when I heard a slight noise over by the desk area. I was standing between the rows of tall metal file cabinets. I was right in a line with the workstation where I could see the tall office chair, & the computer. I heard the office chair squeak. Like someone just moved it or turned it around. Out of my periphery I could clearly see a man of about 5' 8"" tall, dark hair, slight moustache, well-dressed with dark pants, a white shirt wearing a long Lab coat with a stethoscope draped around his neck & his hand on the back of the office chair. Nothing unusual there. I turned to face him to ask him if I could help him. Just as I faced him straight on 'poof' he disappeared right in front of me leaving the chair he had his hand on twirling around. Just like that!

 I stood there blinking & trying to rationalize what just happened. I was mildly startled, but not the least bit frightened. I recalled the story the other girls in the office had told me. I didn't take them too seriously at the time. I thought they were just slinging the bull to me, the new girl. I was rather fascinated to discover that it was true. My previous paranormal episodes in my life rather prepared me for 'this' instant.

I could scarcely contain my excitement, but I finished my work that I was doing as quickly as I could. When I got back upstairs to the office it must've shown on my face. Karen, one of my coworkers noticed right away. She came up alongside of me and whispered ""Did you meet the doc?"".

I shook my head in confirmation. I was excited, not scared. I wanted to know if they knew 'who' he was. Karen just shrugged that they didn't really know who he was but figured out that he must've been a previous doctor that possibly worked there many years ago. She told me when she first started it was 15 years before I did. She was working down there pulling films and sending them up in the dumbwaiter that they used just for that purpose. She was just opening the dumbwaiter door to put some folders inside when she saw him from the corner of her eye. She, too, thought he was a real person. She went to ask him if he needed help when he vanished in front of her like he did with me. She wasn't as calm and collected about the incident as ""I"" was. She dropped what she was doing and ran faster than she ever thought she could out of there. She went next door to the laundry room where she worked before, she went to radiology and sat down in their little office to get herself together.

 One of her friends could see something was amiss with her and asked her what the problem was. She told her. The woman nodded and grinned. She told her ""Don't worry. He won't hurt you. He comes here occasionally. We'll briefly see him walk in and disappear, but he doesn't really bother anyone."". She told her that they thought he was just curious as to what is going on in the hospital now. 

I surmised with the others that he once worked there and must have been very devoted to his profession. Possibly that devotion is what keeps him tied there. I haven't been there now for about 8 years, but I imagine he is still making his rounds like every good doctor does."
"Grandma's Visits","Ohio","Family / Friends Visits","This occurred back in 1975 when I was married to Bill, my first husband. The marriage stunk, and that was probably the reason all this happened.

We had just moved into a nice 3-story apartment complex on Euclid Avenue in Euclid, Ohio. It was a spacious, and beautiful 1-bedroom apartment. It contained a huge living room which led outside to a lovely balcony. Off of the living room was a dining room with a large folding-door closet, and opposite the closet was the entrance to the kitchen which was considered practical sized for an apartment. We had a very big bedroom containing a large walk-in closet. Adjacent to the bedroom was the bathroom. We resided on the 2nd floor.

 In order to enter the apartment, we had an outside metal door that was painted white. To get in one had to enter from an outside stairway downstairs and walk up to the next level. That metal door made a very distinct noise when open/closed. I'm mentioning 'that' door for a reason that will become clear.

I must explain that Bill had a great deal of trouble holding a job. He had a condition called laziness. If something involved actual 'work' he couldn't do it for more than a week, or two. If it wasn't for 'me' working, we never would've gotten that nice apartment.

It was on my day off. I worked at a hospital as a nurse aide, and we got days off in the middle of the week if we had to work weekends. Bill was at work, and I chose to go back to bed for a few more Z's. I was laying prone (on my stomach) when I heard the outside door into the living room open, and close. Like I said you couldn't miss the sound of that door. I called out to Bill thinking that he's lost another job again, and was coming home to give me the song, and dance as to 'why' he lost it. I heard no reply. I called out again. Again, no reply. I thought I was just hearing things and tried to resume going back to sleep.

 Suddenly I 'did' hear a voice calling 'me'. A very familiar voice. It was my grandma who had passed on about 4 years earlier. She said very clearly in her German accent "" Linda. Get up. It's after 9:00. Is getting late. Get up Honey."". I freaked, and just continued to lay there not moving a muscle. I rationalized with myself that I was just more tired than usual and my mind was playing tricks on me. I continued to lay in bed when her voice resounded from the doorway of our bedroom. What? I told myself. Still, I didn't budge. 

All of a sudden, her voice sounded right next to the bed, and the bed began to visibly shake. I did a 5-foot leap out of the bed. I stood near the closet just staring at the bed which was now unmoving. I thought I was going bonkers. I calmed down and decided to crawl back in bed. However, the moment I pulled the covers up the bed shook much more violently. Yikes! Again, I did an athletic leap out of bed, and I am not an athlete. I was visibly rattled until I quieted myself and began to 'really' think about what just happened. I came to realize that my grandma dearly loved me and would never intentionally try to frighten me. She was letting me know she was checking on me. I felt much better. I did not feel in any way threatened by grandma.

I told Bill about it that evening. He laughed at me and called me wacky. I didn't appreciate that. 

My sister Arlene, and her friend came to visit. I mentioned it to her. Her face went pale. She told me that grandma was coming to her a week before she came to me. Bill's jaw dropped. He knew 2 people in different places, and time periods did not share the same hallucination. He shut up after that one.

Years later we were living in his foster-mom's house. She had passed on and the estate was going through probate. Her cousin asked us to stay in the house until everything was resolved with the relatives. We put our double-bed in the living room since it was the warmest room, and this was during the Winter. 

I had a day off, and Bill wasn't working at all. Not unusual for him. We were in bed when I heard the outside alcove door open, and close. I heard footsteps coming to the main door that led into the dining room with the living room adjacent to it. Aha! I heard grandma's voice calling "" Linda, get up. It's getting late honey!"". I laid still knowing what was coming. She got closer and repeated herself. I didn't budge. The bed began shaking very hard. I casually got up and stood off to the front watching Bill bolt upright with a perplexed look on his face. ""What the 'bleep' is going on?"" he blurted out. I told him it was grandma shaking the bed, and he'd best get up. He said I was wacky and laid back down. By then the bed was almost bouncing off the floor. He shot-put from the bed. Ha! I didn't know he had it in him. He was trembling just staring at the shaking bed. I told him "" That's my wacky imagination doing that, eh? "". He was dumbfounded. He 'finally' believed me. I was never so happy that grandma came by to put 'him' in his place. 

Once I divorced Bill, and married John the visits stopped. I believe that grandma knew I was having a very troublesome, and unhappy marriage. She was looking in on me and letting me know that 'she' still cared about me. My late 2nd husband still looks in on me, also. I believe our loved ones never quit loving, worrying, or caring about those they left behind. They let us know from time to time, and that's a nice feeling."
"Spiritual Visitations Do Happen","Ohio","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","We have all lost loved ones, let's face it. I lost my wonderful spouse, John, almost 8 years ago and it was the hardest thing I've 'ever' faced in my entire life. It was far worse than 'any' physical pain you can imagine. Someone could have stuck me in the gut with a Bowie knife, and I'd have pulled it out & laughed compared to losing my special soulmate. Believe me!

I lost John to a catastrophic illness. Nothing I could do, or the doctors could save him and believe me we tried. I had to accept the fact that it was just 'his' time as someday it'll be mine. We 'all' have 'that' appointment to keep. Like it, or not.

I was in a state of emotional melt down. Yet somehow God kept me going! I give credit where credit is due. I managed to do my work, take care of the medical bills, and what have you. I don't know 'how' I even did it, but I did.

My sister-in-law, Beth helped tremendously. That was her brother. We cried on each other's shoulders and gave each other emotional support. She and John had a falling out the year before he passed and she felt so guilty over that. She always 'wanted' to reconcile with him, but never got the chance. 

About 3 weeks after his passing, she had the first visit from John. She told me that she was in bed when she saw the room light up. She heard his voice greeting her. She jumped out of bed. Lo, and behold; there was John sitting in the chair next to the bed looking as healthy, and robust as ever she saw him. She was above and beyond thrilled to see him. She sat on the side of the bed to grab his hand and talk to him. She told him how sorry she was and that she loved him and wanted his forgiveness. He said he loved her and apologized for his part in the misunderstanding that caused the hard feelings in the first place. He told her he was alright now and knew how she was feeling. He, also, told her that he was aware of my pain, and how much I loved him. He said he'd visit me also. She was so happy to hear and talk to him. They talked for about 10-15 minutes then he said he had to go. She didn't want him to, but he told her he 'had' to. Next thing she knew she was sitting on the bed staring at an empty chair. Her husband was still sleeping and had never woken up during her conversation with John. She felt such joy and peace after that.

I was a bit envious that my husband went to his sister first when 'I' was suffering so much grief and hurting so horrifically. Beth figured it out and explained that my extreme grief was putting up an emotional wall of sorts that made it difficult for him to penetrate. I couldn't help 'how' I felt at that time. 

I endured about 3 months of extreme grief and crying. Finally, I was to the point of complete emotional exhaustion and physical collapse. One night when I went to bed, I thought I'd just pass out. I didn't. I just laid there, but I was truly drained. Suddenly, I felt the warmth of an arm wrap around my waist. I was startled until John spoke to me. He said "" that's right. It's really me Sweetie!"". I leapt up from bed, and he got up with me. I actually saw him, embraced him, and felt his warm, passionate kiss on my lips. I turned on the bedroom light. I cried and sat at the foot of the bed with John beside me. He was glowing with health. He looked positively wonderful. I began telling him how much I loved and missed him. He smiled and said he knew I did. He said he'd always love me and watch over me from time to time. He told me that I'd be alright. He said ""No matter what. You'll be O.K. Sweetie. You're a fighter. Not a quitter. You'll be alright, I promise!"".

He said what I yearned and absolutely 'needed' to hear. He told me he had to leave. I asked him to stay, but he reiterated that he had to go. He told me he's perfectly alright, and would always love me, and look in on me in the future. He 'has', too!

I'm here to confirm to anyone whose gone through or going through this kind of loss. Spiritual visits are absolutely real, provide comfort and extraordinary peace of mind. Let this personal story give you strength, and assurance like it has for me."
"Two Episodes Of Curious Nature","Illinois","Misc","I have been a long time reader on this site, but have never taken the time to set and write up my experiences. Both these incidents have been years apart and no way connected, but they are pretty fresh in my mind. Hope they are a good read for all! 

1. It was in 2010. My husband and I lived in a townhouse and were avid horror show fans. We literally only watched the ""Ghost Hunter"" episodes on every channel, Haunting movies and TV shows, Ghost Whisperer etc. It was fun for us honestly, we didn't take any of what we watched too seriously.

 One night, it would be around 12:30pm - 1am, I remember being in a dream like state and clearly seeing something standing behind our bedroom window curtain. It had long hair which was blowing around and I could see a hand coming out from behind the curtain. For a minute or so I felt totally paralyzed with fear. It was as if my subconscious was telling me to wake up before what ever that was comes out from the curtains.

 I could feel the sweat on my back and using all the strength I could muster to sit up on the bed. And my husband sat up on the bed at the exact same time. We both jumped and then looked at each other. I asked him ""bad dream""? And he stares at the curtain and describes EXACTLY what I had seen. I was shaking by then and we both left the room and went to sit in the living room all night. It never happened again, and I never felt unsafe in that house. We did increase our repertoire of shows though! 

2. This was less dramatic. We were returning from a party late at night (around 1am). Our 6yr old was sleeping in the backseat. There's a road near our home which is a wooded area and has estates, horse riding institute and golf courses on each side. The road is kind of hilly, so you feel like you are on a smooth roller coaster.

 I could see a white figure about 100yards from us. I thought it was a white smudge on the windshield honestly. The figure stayed the same size even though we were close to it. The car went through one of the troughs when we were right next to the white misty figure and the proximity alert on the car beeped! I was shocked for a second and then looked back but couldn't see anything on the road. My husband, who was driving, said it was just the road being so uneven that caused the beeping. We have traveled on that road 100s of times since, but no beeps yet! I certainly don't take that road late at night anymore, even though it's a shortcut."
"My Ghostly House","Massachusetts","Haunted Places","My home was built in the 60's, meaning that stuff probably went down there.

When my parents were looking at the house, there was just bottles of holy water (and possibly sage) in the basement. 

They were all from the years 1996-1999. 

We knew something was off about this, and we wanted them to just take the holy water with them.

We still have the holy water (none of the possible sage though.) 

But I do think that they have a good reason why, and here is my experience with some ghostly activity.

One day, my aunt left her dog at our house so we could hang out with the doggo because we were still getting used to our new dog. 

The morning after the drop off, I awoke to some growling noises from under my bed. 

I looked around my room and my aunt's dog was nowhere in sight. I had reason to believe that something was up. 

Long after this particular activity, I got chills and a sense of presence whenever I stood in the middle of my room. 

So, I took out my EMF detector, and started hunting away. 

My EMF detector started to hit red, and that's where I just turned it off and thought about the events leading up to this particular day. 

Now this final story may sound stupid, but I feel as if something went on. 

As a joke, I put my magic 8-ball on my bible, and put a cross next to it with my friends. 

I said are you a ghost.

""no.""

We sighed and continued on. 

Later, we took away the bible and cross and asked are you a ghost?

""Yes.""

Are you evil?

""yes.""

We freaked out after that and we stopped.

I know that last story sounded stupid, but I thing something went down there.

Let me know what you think down below, and if you have something to say about any of these occurrences, ask, and I will gladly answer!"
"Strange Encounter With An Entity","New York","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I was wondering if anyone can give me some advice on an event. Recently (past 6 months) I have been experiencing a strange interaction with a spiritual entity. Experiences have ranged from hearing a monotone bird-like whistle at early times in the morning while I'm outside (5:30). If I choose to ignore the whistling, everything is fine, but if I choose to look in the direction of whistling I suddenly get dizzy and feel as if I'm about to faint, before seeing a shadow move quickly around me. 

The first encounter I believe was around Oct 15, 2022. I was washing some coolers outside when I heard a monotone whistle, which was coming from my boyfriend's yard (he lives across the street from me). I looked over and felt as if everything was spinning, I saw what I believed was my boyfriend standing on his porch staring at me, but his face was blurred out. After reaching inside and closing the door, the spinning stopped. Upon questioning my boyfriend about the situation, he claimed no one else was home at the time, and he was asleep inside. I disregarded the situation and we didn't speak of it again.

About 2 months later (Christmas time) I was outside setting up some decorations when I heard the same whistling and footsteps in his yard. (the whistling sounded like his but in a monotone) I turned and there was no one there. Upon asking him again, he told me he was working in his attic at the time and no one was outside. This was about 7 in the afternoon. I haven't had many more encounters since then, but there are days when I can hear the same whistling right outside my bedroom window and the more I ignore it the louder it gets. 

My boyfriend has also told me he has seen ""me"" outside at times when I wasn't and that I would look directly at him and smile... Minding that he would be standing by a window, and I usually don't just stare at his house or windows like that. He has also mentioned that he would sometimes hear me calling him outside at 3 in the morning almost as if I'm trying to lure him out the house.

We have found it strange the this entity has chosen to present itself in the form of the other, but we never learned its intentions. If you could please reach out and help me understand why this might have been happening, that would be great, thank you. Please feel free to ask for any more information about the situation if needed, I would be happy to provide you with more details."
"Strange Series Of Events At Work","New York","Haunted Places","This happened a few days ago at my workplace. I was working this opening shift with the same co-worker I always do. I got there first and went into the break room to put my stuff down. As I was putting my bag down on the table, I started to get this distinct feeling that I wasn't alone. Not necessarily being watched, just that I wasn't alone. Then, I started hearing two voices outside the room, a man and a woman. There's a really loud fan in this particular room just off the break room, so I couldn't really hear what they were saying. It sounded like indistinct whispering. I assumed it was just maintenance personnel, but I went to look anyway. There was no one there. 

I went back into the break room to finish getting settled, still feeling like I wasn't alone. Then, I heard some loud banging noises like an animal in the vent above me. I was so startled I ran out of the break room. The noises stopped, and I went back inside. This is a noise that my co-worker and I have heard several times and reported several times, but they haven't been able to find an animal or another reason for it. I finished up in the break room and started getting set up for work. As I was preparing some things, I felt like I was being watched and like there was an actual presence in the room with me. 

My co-worker showed up and we got to work, and there were two patrons in the room with us, but I still couldn't shake the feeling of there being a fifth presence. Then, one of the patrons just stopped doing what she was doing, focused on something all the way on the opposite side of the room, waved, and said ""hi."" I looked at the spot she was looking at, and there was no one there. My co-worker turned to me and said, ""What was that?"" and I said ""I don't know. I don't see anyone there.""

This is not the first time strange things have happened at my workplace, and I'm not really sure what to make of it."
"Skull Scare","Ohio","Haunted Items","This took place in the mid-80s when I was eleven or twelve. My mom was an art teacher back then, and my best friend's mom was an artist, so there were a lot of ""artsy"" things floating around our two households: cracked pottery, sculptures, fancy drapes, costume jewelry, you name it... But the one that took the cake was a real human skull that my friend's mom used for a sketching model. How she came to own it is unclear to me. I do know that it wasn't a deceased family member. 

The first incident took place on an extremely cold evening in January. My friend invited several of us over to her place to hang out. The reason I mention the cold is because she had dark thermal drapes in her room; the drapes kept out the chill, but they also blocked out streetlights, headlights and whatever natural light was left that day. We decided not to turn on the inside lights and lit a couple of candles instead. 

After playing a few rounds of cards, one of us had the bright idea that we should try to summon spirits. We had no idea what we were doing but we wanted to make it a glamorous affair by decorating my friend's dresser with ""offerings"". The dresser had a huge trifold mirror on top. We draped some sparkly necklaces and scarves around the mirror, put some jewelry boxes in front of it, set the candles in front of the mirror, spread out our deck of cards, and - you guessed it - placed the skull in the middle of this arrangement. Then we huddled on my friend's bed and waited.

None of us knew how to summon spirits, so we just sat there waiting for something to happen. I had some misgivings about using the skull, but went along with the scheme thinking that it was harmless enough. Since I was a little scared, I didn't look at the dresser, but focused my attention on the dark corner shielded from all light by a huge old-fashioned wardrobe. The corner was very dark. Suddenly a faint circular light appeared there and started to grow. Strangely enough it did not scare me; I just sat there and watched it get bigger. It felt like a long time, but I doubt that this lasted longer than a few seconds. Suddenly, the bedroom door flew open and my friend's three-year-old brother burst into the room banging pot lids together and offering to fry us an egg. The light from the hallway poured into the dark bedroom and the faint circle of light disappeared.

I asked my friends later if any of them saw anything. They said they didn't. But they were looking at the dresser and the mirror. I was the only one who was too scared to look at our centerpiece! I tried to convince myself afterwards that what I saw was perfectly ""natural"". Perhaps it was a ray of light that preceded the opening of the bedroom door, I argued. Unfortunately no explanation seemed completely adequate - light from the door would have started as a linear streak, not a circle. Maybe darkness messed with my vision, but then again, perhaps we were all saved from a massive scare (or worse) by a three-year-old chef!

The following fall, my mom borrowed the skull for sketching. For a few weeks it sat in the middle of our fancy dining room table (the kind that only gets used at Christmas). As I didn't have to see the skull at night, I wasn't particularly scared of it, but generally preferred to steer clear. Several weeks into the skull's temporary residency my mom called me into the dining room and asked me to bring a duffle bag. She seemed very concerned about something. When I arrived with the bag, she loaded the skull into the bag, told me not to touch the skull and asked me to take it back to my friend's house as soon as possible. I was really spooked at that point and ran rather quickly to my friend's place. 

When I got back, my mom breathed a sigh of relief and told me that she thought the skull had really bad energy. A few weeks later she explained that after she brought the skull home, all kinds of little things started going wrong - nothing really serious, just annoying little things. She didn't elaborate, but said that as soon as the skull left, everything went back to normal."
"Phantom House Workers","Idaho","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","Over the past few years I haven't experienced anything other than the usual knocking sounds and shadows... Fairly normal stuff here that I've gotten used to. However, the other night I got up at around 2 am to use the bathroom and had an unusual experience that I wanted to share.

I walked out of my bedroom into the hallway to get to the bathroom which is across the hall and down about five paces. If you were to continue down the hall past the bathroom you would reach a doorway to the living room on the left, whereas the kitchen entrance is at the hall end on the right.

The hall was pitch black in darkness. I don't usually turn lights on because I know the short distance to the bathroom and don't think about it. As I was about to turn into the bathroom I heard a deep male voice coming from the living room. He sounded as if he was facing me, and his voice was clear and projected to me well. He said ""We're almost done here."" I got the impression that he was with some other people and they were working on something in my living room. I didn't see any signs of light, so I didn't feel worried about an intruder. I also didn't think an intruder would make that announcement.

In the bathroom I quickly closed the door and turned on the light. I thought perhaps I had imagined the voice and that maybe I was still a bit asleep. So I did what I came to do, and turned out the light before opening the door to go back to my room, and didn't worry about it. 

When I got in the dark hall, I heard the voice again, saying the same thing. I quickly went into my room, locked the door, and slept the rest of the night with a dim bedside light on. I file this away with the strange and unexplained experiences."
"The Devil In The Bathroom","Arizona","Haunted Places","I was six years old. My older sister was nine. The year was 1982. My mom and dad went out somewhere that night and got us a babysitter.

 We lived in a very small, 2 story, 2 bedroom apartment with one bathroom that was upstairs. Our babysitter was a teenage girl who lived 2 doors down.

The babysitter was keeping us occupied, and I remember we were all coloring at the table. I had to go to the bathroom really bad, but I was scared to go upstairs alone. I don't remember ever being scared in that house before this day. I asked my sister if she would come with me to the bathroom. She said no because she was coloring. I kept asking her, almost begging her if she would come with me, but she kept saying no. Finally, the babysitter got sick of me asking, yelled at me, and told me to go to the bathroom by myself because my sister did not want to go. 

I remember being so scared as I walked up those stairs alone. Before I knew it, I was standing on the top landing. The small hallway was dark, and so was the bathroom. I stood there on the landing, tilting my head in front of the doorway. The only part of my body entering the bathroom was my tiny hand to flip on the light switch as I stepped up that last stair into the hallway.

The lights were those horrible fluorescent tube lights that flickered for moments before coming all the way on. As I flipped up the light switch, the lights dimly turned on, flickering. At that moment, in the dim light, I saw it. The devil was sitting on the rim of the bathtub! It was what you would almost picture in your mind as a stereotypical looking devil. It was red, had horns, and a tail. It sat there on rim of the the bathtub, motionless, silent, and we locked eyes for what seemed like an eternity.

I was petrified and I physically couldn't move. The lights seemed to stay flickering a lot longer than what they normally would. Finally, when the lights came all the way on and fully illuminated the bathroom, the devil was gone.

I must have ran back down the stairs right after that, but I was so scared I don't remember. My sister says she remembers me running downstairs yelling, ""THE DEVIL IS IN THE BATHROOM!"" She said she remembers running upstairs to the bathroom, and moving the shower curtain around to see if anything was in the bathtub.

The next thing I remember was my mom walking into the house and me running to her, telling her the devil was in the bathroom, but she didn't take me seriously. So, I ran outside to my dad. He picked me up and held me his arms and I told him that I saw the devil in the bathroom. I remember him saying to me, ""I believe you.""

That was the very first paranormal experience I had that I can remember. It was several years later before I had my next experience with the paranormal."
"Who Pressed The Button?","New York","Misc","My dad passed away less than a week ago, relative to the time I'm writing this. Cancer is the official cause of death, but given he'd not eaten for 9 days and not had anything to drink for 2 days prior to his death, the rational part of me says to go with starvation. Yesterday, I saw something weird happen as I rode an elevator and it happened again three times today.

I'm sure everyone understands how elevators work. Press the call button, get on, press the button for your floor, and then relax. And there's also a couple of other buttons to hold the door open to be polite, force the doors closed to be rude, and a button to call for help in the event of a malfunction.

Since I have ""fat fingered"" the floor buttons many times before, I make sure to press just the button for my floor and then get as far away from that panel as I'm able. Yet, once yesterday, and three times today so far, the emergency call system was activated. It would ring three times, there would be clicky static and then it would disconnect. I let building management know since having a working emergency system is quite useful to anyone trapped in the elevator. And my default to rational explanations and being skeptical makes me think it is a glitch in the system.

However, the frequency with which it has happened to me lately makes me not so sure of the rational explanation. A few possibilities come to my mind. Could be a short, could be roaches dining on wiring insulation, could also be from the fact that a part of the apartment building roof was damaged and rain got into the elevator shaft.

And I know we here tend to go to the ghostly explanation which does sometimes apply, but I'm just hoping there's a more mundane issue to explain it. Your thoughts are appreciated. Thanks."
"The Old Furniture Room","North Carolina","Haunted Places","Out of all of my experiences, I'm surprised I haven't thought to write about my grandparents house until now.

 Currently, they are living in a retirement home but for 27 years, they lived in a beautiful home in the woods in North Raleigh. 10 or more of those years I had spent nearly every weekend at that house with them from Friday-Sunday night. In all of those years, I never got over my fears, just something about that house or probably the property more like... I'm not sure but I think they were the only people that ever lived in it. It was actually a really nice neighborhood but it was heavily wooded in between each home. I also would like to add before I jump in, is this house was really fancy, nice walls and carpet and just great architecturally. Just incase anyone wonders if it was some old, beaten up house, it definitely was not! 

The earliest memory of my fears was their windows. But only at night! This might be a common fear, I'm not even sure. They had tall windows that went from the floor to almost the ceiling in most of the rooms. At night, I was so frighten walking from the living room across the house into the guest room that I slept in. I would hold onto my grandma so tightly while walking with her. I think my biggest worry was imagining a creepy man being able to watch me or all of us but we can't see him. They didn't have curtains but they did have blinds and they didn't pull them down in the beginning until I begged my grandma to when I got older, but still a kid. She thought I was so strange for being so afraid. My grandma is the most gentle, sweet, quiet, feminine little grandma you could imagine. I felt totally safe with her. It was just that house. 

They had an ""old furniture room"" that was directly next to the guest room I slept in. Oh! And by the way, I didn't start sleeping in there until around age 9! I slept with my grandma in their room and we made my grandpa sleep in the guest room for the first couple of years I was regularly going there. Back to this old furniture room. There was an antique couch and two matching chairs, a Bible from the early 1900s that I have today, a creepy clown velvet picture hung up, and pictures of my grandma's family on the wall from her childhood. I was completely afraid of this room. Or all of the rooms on this wing of the house but this one especially. I pinned it on the clown picture but now that I'm older, I'm realizing it's just that whole part of the house. I had toys in that closet so I usually had to go in there if I wanted to get my toys out. When exiting, I had to run. Something inside me made me feel like I had to run! And that feeling lasted until my 20s! I'd run across the house into the living room, where I felt the safest apparently. I'd look back and of course, see nothing had chased me. 

 One particular day I was in the bathtub and heard who I swore was my grandma walking back and forth outside of the bathroom. It was only us home. I had called for her to see if she'd pop her head in so I could ask what she's doing but no answer. After my bath and I had gotten dressed, I found her in the living room doing Bible study and she said she had not been back there at all. That gave me chills because I know the sounds of them walking on that thick carpet, it's not too heavy but you still just get familiar with sounds.

 I had my step-sibling stay with me for a weekend before and they too, heard the steps while they were taking a shower, but thought or asked if it was me. I had another childhood friend stay with me and she got an awful vibe from those back rooms as well. But never my grandparents. They never felt what I felt. 

It only got worse when I was older, not better unfortunately. Still ran out of the old furniture room and now was hearing a woman's voice praying aloud. That was only at night when I was trying to sleep. It only happened twice though but extremely scary for me even at age 17. I just always felt like someone was in the guest room with me. I made it a routine to check under the bed before lying in it and inside the closet. Mind you, I was doing none of these things at my home with my dad and stepmom. I would lay there for what felt like an hour or more, just scared for my life until I would finally pass out into my night's rest. 

Even though I felt so uneasy at my grandparents, I loved them so much that I never refused to go there. I just dealt with the fright for years just to be with them. I just wonder who was watching me. Was it my grandma's mother who had passed away long ago? Was it something from the past on that property? I'll never know. I have so many amazing memories, growing up with them and visiting that house but the feeling that house gave me, was not like anything I have experienced since."
"My Uncle Billy-never Met Him-sort Of!","Pennsylvania","Haunted Places","Way back in the Jurassic period, 1963-1969, we would go to Pennsylvania to visit with my grandparents. They lived in a small-town called Ellwood City. We would spend days, or even weeks there when I was a kid. Of course, when my little sister, Arlene, & myself were there longer than a weekend my parents would leave us with our Grandparents. We would have such a wonderful time being spoiled rotten by Grandma, & Grandpa. Oh, they 'were' told by our parents that 'if' we misbehaved that they had 'permission' to discipline us. However, Arlene, & I pretty much behaved as we enjoyed being in the country, and romping about. Eating Grandma's home-made cookies (the best on the planet), & going for rides with them in Grandpa's Corvair. 

In the Summer we'd be there for 2 weeks. We had plenty of relatives since our grandparents had so many children. All those aunts, and uncles had children naturally. We had close to 40 cousins. Yikes! When they had a lot of relatives over, such as during the holidays, you couldn't hardly move for all the people there. 

My grandparents had a large house with a huge living room, sun porch, dining room, kitchen, a full dirt-floored basement, 3 bedrooms upstairs, & the largest bathroom I'd ever seen in my life. However, considering the size of the family a large bathroom was in order. The guest bedroom was next to a linen closet, and in closest proximity to the bathroom. Across from the bathroom in the adjoining hallway were 2 other bedrooms. One was grandpas, and across from his was grandma's. Me, my little sister, and several younger cousins slept in the guest room. Some other young cousins slept with our grandparents.

 The guest bedroom had one big double-bed that my sister, and smaller cousins slept in while I being the oldest of the group, slept in a small roll-away bed at the foot of the double-bed near an outside window, and right outside of the attic door. That attic door was the only problem that ""I"" encountered while in 'that' bedroom. 

I could never seem to relax, or get comfortable. It wasn't the bed. It was being near that attic door, or 'what' was on the other side of it.

I would just lay awake all night staring at it. I just had a funny feeling something was up there, but I didn't understand 'why' I felt like that. Once the daylight broke I was quite relieved to get up, and away from that door. Even if I didn't get any sleep. I never discussed that with anybody. Not even my sister, or the cousins that were my age. I certainly didn't tell my parents. I just pushed it to the back of my mind as the years went on.

Fast forward a few more years. We went to spend another weekend with my grandparents. A lot of other relatives came up, also. My Mom's older brother, Uncle Eddy, and Aunt Rosemary came up with 6 of his 12 children in a van. They brought the 6 oldest children, & the younger ones were left with relatives from Aunt Rosemary's family in Louisiana. 

During that particular time my sister, and Uncle Eddy's kids wondered 'what' was up in the attic that had the dreaded door in the guest room upstairs. Grandpa decided to take us all on a tour of the attic to explore its treasures. This was where the rubber met the road as far as I was concerned. I decided to face my apprehension, and go up into the attic. Ha! Grandpa opened the door, and I observed my little sister, and 6 cousins bound up the steps behind him like little chicks following mother hen. I went to put my foot on the first step, and 'bam'. I hit an ice-cold wall that prevented me from progressing any further. Seriously! I hit a wall of cold. None of the others felt it. Only me. I couldn't move. 

Meanwhile, they were all upstairs in the attic by then, and calling me to come join them. I made some lame-duck excuse; I told them I had a cramp in my leg, and I'd wait downstairs for them to come and tell what all they found up there. They came back down almost an hour later, and reported to me about the wonderful items up there. They, also, mentioned that there was a trunk with a collection of photographs in it. Amongst the pictures was a picture of a casket. Grandpa explained that was his son, Billy, who was killed by a truck in a bicycle accident many years ago. They held the wake/funeral downstairs in the living room in front of the fire place. Shocker! It was to them anyway! However, in 'those' days families held funerals in the homes. I imagine that is still being practiced in some other countries around the World. 

Grandpa said he was hit head-on by the truck, and they had to have a closed casket ceremony because he was so badly disfigured in the accident. I do recall seeing a large oval portrait of my Uncle Billy on the northern wall of the living room. Mom told me it was her brother Billy who died when he was 12. That was all my Mom told me of it.

That still does not explain my uneasiness about the attic until many years later when I was grown, & married. We were visiting my parents. Mom, and I were in the kitchen at the table just drinking coffee, and talking. My husband John, and Dad were in the living room talking. You know! The male/female schism bit. 

I don't know how the conversation got around to Uncle Billy, but Mom told me that due to the fact there were so many kids in the house that they slept crowded in the beds. Some slept down in the living room on a large sofa-bed. Space was pretty much compromised, and Billy wanted his 'own' room. Hence, the only room left was the attic. 'That' became my Uncle Billy's bedroom. Eureka! It all made sense. I surmised that my Uncle's spirit was up there, and possibly 'trying' to communicate to a 'family' member. I was it. Unfortunately, I was far too young to understand what was happening to me at the time. So, I reacted the way most kids would. I got scared.

I often wish I would've been much older when that took place. Once I got older, I began to understand my slight ability. I would not have been frightened, and I would've tried to find out what his message would have been to his other family members.

My grandparents passed on, and the house was sold to another family that is living there to this day. I often wonder about my Uncle Billy, whom I never got to know. I hope he's moved on since there are no longer any family members living in that house.

This incident is what made me realize that I was somewhat psychic, and could sense presences, or things at a young age. I've had other paranormal encounters after this. Not the least of which is 'The House on Erie Road', the first account submitted to this site. However, this occurrence paved the way for what transpired later on."
"Unexplained Noises/occurrences In The Spare Room At Night","Florida","Haunted Places","Thank you for reading.

I am hearing noises in out spare bedroom when I occasionally sleep in there. 

The most frequent (and I am positive 100% it is not rodents) is a distinct ""loud dripping"" noise that always sounds exactly the same. The best way to describe it is that it sounds like drops of water, at a rate of 2 per second, hitting wood. It always wakes me up out of a sound sleep. It sounds like it's just inside the sheet rock and/or right at the doorway (which is closed). It happens in like 3 different locations. 

The next thing is a couple different sounds at the window behind my head. One was very distinct. It sounded like someone was ""cutting"" the corner of the screen out side the closed window with a knife. VERY distinct. It woke me up and stopped, lasted just a few seconds. Last night, in the same location, again a very distinct sound like someone was using a spray bottle. Same location.

I heard sounds like someone was scratching the carpet a couple times. Again, all sounds are very distinct, they always wake me up. When I do wake up, all I hear (most times) is a very ""faint"" sound like someone is moving around the room. It doesn't last that long. A very quiet ""swooshing"" sound like someone clothes just making a ""soft"" noise.

THEN the scariest thing. I get that extreme eerie feeling someone is there. Very close and watching me. I get the most craziest chills running through my entire body. I even left the room a couple times because or it.

Finally, and this is the only thing I could ""possibly"" find a reason for is two times, I was woke up by being ""nudged"" moderately. I do have some spasm's sometimes but they don't usually happen when I am sleeping and they happened in a location where I really don't get them when I get them. Once in the knee, where it actually ""pushed"" my knee and once in the elbow, again, moved it.

I only go to this room when I am snoring because my girlfriend works early and I don't want to keep her awake. I am on a constant daily dose of tramadol (for years now) and recently take Adderall during the day but by the time I sleep, it should be well out of my system. These occurrences usually start after I am asleep for an hour (or less) and usually about the same time at night. 

OH! The biggest thing was the thing that woke me up around 6 am where it felt/sounded like a cat landed right behind my head! I swear it was as if I really felt the ""tap"" it made. Very distinct and made the noise and everything... Jesus. Now that I am writing all this I have to ask. Am I loosing it? Does any of this make sense? Should I do something? I'm living a decent life actually. I'm not really stressed. I was wondering if the meds are doing this and I don't drink (maybe I should lol) 

 Please write back if you can. Thank you kindly, Peter"
"Quasi-ouija Prediction","Ohio","Ouija Board / Seances","When I was in my early teens I used to spend a few weeks each summer at my grandma's farmhouse out in the country. The house was very old, complete with a root cellar under the kitchen, and a rickety staircase. The front part of the house was bright and airy and happy, but the back part was gloomy and creepy. We mostly used the back for storage and rarely went there. The house didn't generally have bad vibes, but I felt like the happy front part of the house was besieged by darkness lingering in the back and in the creepy root cellar underneath. I was never one hundred percent comfortable there.

One time my grandma was out grocery shopping or visiting a friend and I was left alone in the house. There weren't many kids my age in this tiny town and I mostly had to fend for myself for entertainment. TV reception was terrible (this was back in the 80s!), so I spent most of my time walking, reading and doing crafts. 

To break the monotony, I thought that it would be fun to experiment with an Ouija board. I didn't have one on hand, and since I was alone, I didn't think it would work anyway. Then I recalled that a friend once told me that instead of an Ouija, you could use a needle suspended over the alphabet drawn around a circle. The needle would supposedly move and point to letters in response to questions. It didn't sound very legit, but I was bored and decided to try it. 

I drew letters around a circle and suspended a needle on a thread over it. The needle settled pointing to the center of the circle (thank you, Gravity) and did not move again. But I wasn't going to give up that easily! I figured that if I rested the point of the needle in the center and tilted the needle a little by lowering its top, I could get the top to spin around while the tip remained anchored in the center, then the top was bound to settle pointing to a letter. This time I had the laws of physics on my side, so the needle did indeed point to different letters each time I gave it whirl. 

I'm sure I started with some silly questions about which boys liked me, and I'm sure I got some gibberish answers. It wasn't really working. I was ready to give up, but decided to ask what my profession will be when I grew up. The needle spelled the word ""shoe"". This freaked me out. I ran out of the house and sat out in the yard until grandma returned.

Once back from summer break, I told my friends about what had happened. We had a good laugh about me becoming a shoe. Several years went by and I had forgotten about the incident entirely. It all came back though, when I found myself working in the SHOE department at a large store."
"Confused About A Possibly Negative (or Neutral) Entity","Texas","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","These occurrences have happened recently, but they all tie into an older story/series of small events throughout the years that have been similar to these listed. 

To preface, I'll start a couple months ago, when I was in bed sick with the flu. On one of the worst nights in terms of being sick, I had this dream that I was out having a picnic mourning the loss of a family member out by the woods behind my house. I felt called to walk into a clearing that's there so I left my family, entered, and felt a presence within my dream lucidly. 

I was looking around trying to find who was there and telling whoever it was to come out. I saw huge black wings passing behind trees and disappearing, kind of phasing in and out of sight. Finally, the being stepped out towards me, and I was surprised to find it was a tall man with jet black hair, incredibly pale skin and golden eyes. It sounds weird but I'm just making sure to be descriptive in case any comments ask to describe him. 

He approached me and I instantly warmed up feeling this intense love and comfort and solace. I felt like I'd known him for ages and even walked up to him like I had, which is when he opened up his arms and hugged me. To be honest, it was really profound and I definitely cried because it felt so nice. 

After we hugged, he pulled away and I saw this phial in his hand. It was opaque white liquid. He held it up and offered it to me which confused me. He said: ""We could be together, you know. But make sure it's what you really want."" I knew he meant in drinking the liquid, however dreams manage that. I also knew he meant that if I drank the liquid, I would 'die"" and be transported to whatever plane he was existing on. I said no because of my family and I wanted to live. He respected that decision and stepped away, but I felt intense sadness coming from him. The dream ended when I left the woods. 

Fast forward to now. I've been seeing this same person in dreams here and there. I also saw a swirling black mass in the corner of my room a few weeks ago in my peripheral vision. Then I felt someone plant their hand on my upper back while I was up having fun gaming. It startled me bad. 

Just yesterday, I was taking notes at the computer for my history class (I'm homeschooled) when the stand holding my digital art pen suddenly and very clearly slid towards me. He'd mentioned my art before in some dream or some telepathic communication beforehand, I just don't really remember how. When the pen stand slid, I wasn't even alone - my family was there, too. Nothing like that has ever happened before so obviously right in front of my eyes. 

Last night I went to bed and was having yet another dream about this black haired man. The setting was bizarre and sparkly, kind of etheric, almost, but it was all really hazy and weird. I saw his face sort of fading in and out when I heard his voice, disembodied from what I was seeing, say, ""I've come for you. I'm here for you right now."" 

That startled me out of the dream. I looked around my room to make sure no one was in there, which there wasn't, nothing out of the ordinary happened. So, I went back to bed. But this morning, I woke up with a single thin scratch on my chest a few inches above my heart. It's too thin to be my own nails, I don't sleep with pets, and there was nothing sharp on my bed. 

I don't know what to make of all of this. Can someone help? I'm torn about what I should do. Any clarity would be appreciated. Sorry for the super long post, I just wanted to get it all out in one place."
"House On Erie Road, Willoughby, Ohio","Ohio","Haunted Places","It took me over 40 years to write about this account with a calm, & analytical frame of mind. Initially, every time my husband, & I 'tried' to write about it we'd get rattled & discontinue it. We wanted to send this account to the well-known parapsychologist, Hans Holzer to add to his files, but we never got around to it. I assume if you're reading this that you're a believer. So, here goes!

One of the most powerful experiences happened in my mid to late twenties shortly after my divorce from Bob, my first husband. I met John as a blind date, & amazingly we immediately clicked. He fell for me at first sight. It was a second marriage for both of us & it took us a few months to get adjusted to each other, but we were so very much alike it was spooky. Pardon the pun!

He was living in a house on Erie Road not too far from downtown Willoughby, Ohio. This particular house I was familiar with since I was a kid. The neighborhood kids, & I used to ride our bicycles past that house on Erie Road in the Summer months. Every time I looked at 'that' house I got the crawling scalp. I could just sense something wrong about it. My gaze was usually drawn to the 3rd floor upstairs window that I, later discovered, was an attic. I felt something up there to be looking back at me & letting me know ""yes, I'm here. Just keep riding on!"". I instinctively knew the house was haunted. Not just because it was a decrepit, run-down dwelling over 100 years old, but because I just 'felt' it.

Many years later I never imagined that I'd actually be living there with my second husband, & his mother, Mary. Mary was divorced from Tom her second husband & needed somewhere to live. John, & his sister, Jean invited her to live with them. John, & Jean are the ones who originally found the house & rented the upstairs portion. It was an old farmhouse that was converted into up,& down apartments. 

However, when John, & I got together Jean had married, & moved out. Mary was a wonderful mother-in-law, & on top of that, she was incredibly psychic. John was psychic, & I, likewise, was slightly psychic. Now, you get three psychic individuals in a haunted environment with an electrical power sub-station in a wooded area not even 80 yards behind the house, & you're looking at paranormal disaster. As we were later to find out.

It started out innocuous enough with very little drawing our attention. We'd just shrug those little things off. However, the more we settled into a home-life routine, the more things began to get noticed. Incidents like apports. That is to say, solid objects disappearing into thin air & turning up in the most unlikely places. When you put a coffee pot on a stove, leave the room for a few seconds, go back, the pot is gone, & cannot be found 'anywhere'. A day later said coffee pot turns up in the refrigerator. Gimme' a break! All sorts of items were going missing to be found hours, or days later. 

We'd hear our names called with no one there. Being touched with no one nearby. Hearing sounds that cannot be accounted for. Going away for a few hours, & coming home to the kitchen floor having 2 inches of ice-cold water on it. No water was left running, there was no rain, & the roof didn't leak. We began to doubt our sanity until we 'realized' that the house was, in fact, haunted.

Mary being Catholic sprinkled Holy Water around, but it may as well have been chocolate syrup. In fact, things escalated to a fever pitch. Outbreaks of millions of baby spiders swarming all over the ceiling of John, & mine bedroom. Later, there was the outbreak of millions-no exaggeration-of millipedes. Little wireworms crawling all over the inside, & outside of the house. Even spilling out into the front yard.

Super nightmare.

 Another time I was alone in the living room seated on the couch with the dog, Bumpy at my feet, reading a book. Suddenly she rose, stared at the ceiling, began a low growling with all the hackles on her back raised, & trembling against my legs. From the far end of the house, directly over the kitchen, I heard up in the attic, heavy footsteps. It sounded like a very large man with work boots on walking from that end to the living room right over my head. I even heard the boots squeal as they did a 180, and marched slowly back over the kitchen area. That was too much. I tore out of the living room, down the hall, through the kitchen, and into the imagined safety of the bathroom with the poor dog hot on my heels. Her, and I just waited in the bathroom for John to come back home.

 We burst out of the bathroom, and I excitedly told him what just transpired. He grabbed a bat, and went up the attic stairs. I followed him. Of course there was no human intruder found. I knew that there wouldn't be either.

In the attic directly behind the railing at the top of the stairs was a tremendous cold cubicle. It was about 5 feet wide, & 8 feet deep. In the Summer months the temperature up there rose to almost 120 degrees. Yet in 'that' one area behind the railing it was like a meat-locker. You could stick your arm in & feel the ice-cold & see your breath. We deduced that the 'thing' was concentrated in 'that' area for the most part. However, it still had the ability to make 'us' miserable.

 It began to affect our moods in the most negative ways. We'd fight for the most inconsequential things. Leave the house, and then wonder 'why' we fought in the first place. It even drove John to drinking and charging up the steps to the attic to do battle with it. I managed to sober him up, calm him down, and rationalize with him. We made the decision to sell whatever we could to earn extra money in addition to our work paychecks & get out. If something doesn't want you there you 'cannot' reason with it. Just get out.

 When we found a nice mobile home in West Park Cleveland we loaded up the car with all our belongings, and 2 dogs and left so fast that we left a vapor trail behind us. We never looked back. 

It took us the better part of a year living in the trailer adjusting to relative normalcy, to stop jumping at our own shadows. This is no Amityville Horror. This really happened. No one would live in the house too long after we left, & it was sold to a preacher that turned it into a Church. Eeeesh! I hope the religious influence has made a dramatic difference, but we wouldn't even 'drive' by that place anymore. 

To those of you that are skeptics no amount of convincing will sway you. However, to those of you that are dealing with, or have dealt with something like this, I'm sure you more than understand."
"Paranormal Encounters In Gettysburg Part 3","Pennsylvania","Haunted Places","Gettysburg, Pennsylvania is a destination of very high interest among paranormal researchers and enthusiasts due to record high instances of claims regarding otherworldly activity. My family and I were among the many others who claim to have seen and heard remnants from the town's disturbing history that serve to remind us that the past can never be truly buried or forgotten. 

In her lifetime, my grandmother had travelled to several fascinating destinations with her sister Valerie and her brother in law Robert. During the summer of 1990, they decided to spend a weekend in Gettysburg. They had spent the day exploring the town and enjoying the exhibitions that attract several hordes of tourists to Gettysburg every year. One particular exhibition, which has gained a fair amount of popularity, is the Gettysburg Cyclorama, a theater that contains a 360 Degree canvass screen. The screen depicts full motion video of a historical reenactment of the Battle of Gettysburg to give visitors a vague feeling of what it was like to participate in the gruesome battle. 

They checked into a roadside motel in the country at around three in the afternoon. The motel was constructed beside a vast field and was surrounded by a log fence with loopholes carved all along the perimeter. They surmised that the motel was potentially the remains of a historic fort Union soldiers were stationed within to repel Confederate advances. Their room was decorated with periodic elements to provide the motel with a sense of historic authenticity consistent with the 1860s. 

They decided to go to sleep at around ten that night. At roughly 5AM the following morning, my grandmother was abruptly awoken by a series of strange sounds coming from outside in the fields. They sounded suspiciously like several fifes and drums all playing together in unison. She silently stood up and opened the window, careful not to wake my great aunt and uncle. When she opened the window, the sounds grew even louder, thereby eliminating any possibility that it was merely her imagination. She listened attentively for a few more minutes and the sounds soon stopped. She then closed the window slowly and crept back to her bed once all was quiet again. She preferred not to wake the others and decided to wait until dawn to inform them of the incident. Even to this day, my grandmother still struggles to understand how my great aunt and uncle were not awoken by the noise. The only possible theory is that they had become far more exhausted by the day's events and this made it much easier for them to drown out the sounds. 

At breakfast, my grandmother described the sounds in the fields and they had no issues believing her. It was a major conversational topic between the three of them during the ride home. Sadly, after one hundred and twenty seven years since the decisive conflict during the Civil War, the spirits of those who became statistics during one of the bloodiest periods in American history were condemned to remain permanently upon the battlefields playing the same wartime music since the day they tragically met their demise."
"Hotel San Carlos","Arizona","Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels","The Hotel San Carlos was one of the first hotels built in downtown Phoenix. Construction began in 1927 and as of today, it is still an operating hotel. The movie 'Psycho' actually filmed some of the beginning scenes at this hotel. Several years ago I was invited to my niece's art show where her works were showcased in what was then called 'The Ghost Lounge'. This bar was located on the hotel's ground floor and unfortunately has been closed down and closed off to the public now for a while. The hotel was quite popular in it's heyday and many famous Hollywood icons stayed here, including Marilyn Monroe, who always requested a room by the pool so as to avoid the paparazzi who may have been lurking in the hallways. 

I had heard stories that there were reports of multiple ghosts residing here. This historic hotel is a favorite spot for ghost hunters and paranormal teams who choose to spend the night in a paid room (my understanding is where this is an operating hotel, they don't allow groups to come in and conduct random investigations, however, this may have changed). 

I arrived in the early evening and enjoyed seeing all the different art displays of young talented people. There was also a fashion show with some incredible designs being modeled. After the festivities I decided to explore the different floors and took the antique elevator up to different floors. Some of the hotel room doors have plaques displaying the famous people who have stayed there. Displayed on the hallway walls were enlarged sepia photos showcasing various scenes from Phoenix taken a century ago, when the streets were still unpaved. Horses pulled trolleys through the dusty streets. It was fascinating. 

After some exploring on the various upper floors, I made my way down to the 3rd floor. I started exploring the halls and their treasure of pictures from a bygone era when I started to hear what sounded like big band music. It was very static sounding and came in and out. I attributed it to an old piped in sound system. It would come in and fade out, then it would make a crackling sound. I thought this was very apropos given the age of the hotel and actually thought to myself, nice touch. I continued down the hallways on the 3rd floor and would intermittently hear this big band music that seem to be coming from the ceiling, although I didn't see anything that resembled a modern speaker mount. I didn't really think all that much of it and decided to call it a night and head home.

I had parked my car in the hotel's valet parking so went to the front desk to retrieve it. I happened to mention to the woman sitting there that it was a very nice touch having the big band music piped in on the 3rd floor. She gave me an odd look, slowly started sharking her head, and confessed that there was no music at all piped into the hallways. She said she thought I had an experience. This woman was so afraid of the 3rd floor that she confessed to me that she refused to go up there. It is reported to be the most haunted floor. 

I left feeling very perplexed. Did I really hear something ghostly? This was, after all, an operating hotel. Was it coming from one of the tv's in the guest rooms and maybe several guests had it on the same channel? What are the chances? After this experience I did a little research. Apparently there was a big band director many years ago that used to stay at this hotel when there was a performance at the nearby Orpheum Theater. I'm not sure what to think of this experience. It was interesting though that I only heard it on the 3rd floor."
"Shadow Darting Through Foyer At 235 In The Afternoon","West Virginia","Shadow People","Moundsville WV, back in the first week of December 2021, I stopped at my ex-wife, Lefty's house before heading home to Pennsylvania. She answered the door then turned and went 3 or 4 steps up and sat down on the stairs leading upstairs.

 Entering the house, stairs on right, a little dining like room to the immediate left with a small kind of hallway leading to the kitchen in the back with a tv room in between. In the tv room in said hallway is a door that leads to the basement, this hall way runs through the middle of the house. My back was to the front door talking with her for roughly 5 minutes, when a shadow came from the tv/kitchen area swung a left and shot upstairs avoiding hitting her on the steps.

 Now her and I have a 36 year friendship, we are divorced yes but have 2 daughters and 6 grandchildren together. We have had a handful of experiences in different homes we lived in, but this one was way different. I stepped back after the shadow darted upstairs and asked her, did you not just see that, she said what the shadow? I said yes the shadow. She then says good, I'm not losing my mind, someone else has seen it too.

 As I'm asking her how long has this activity been going on, off to my left in the front room, in the corner diagonal from the front inside corner nearest me, a shadow has started to form in the corner. I step forward towards the kitchen in the hallway spin around with my back now towards the kitchen and the little room now on my right. Using the front window reflection I tried to see this mass that was growing in the corner. Not realizing at the time the reason I couldn't see anything was that the thing in the corner was taking the light out of the room. I leaned forward looking to the right and could not see the white walls in the corner behind this mass, it was extremely dark and made me very uncomfortable.

 Not many a thing scares, intimidates or makes me uncomfortable in this life, this thing did all 3 fast. I asked her does she feel the cold coming from that room she just kind of said yeah it's always cold and walks upstairs for a minute leaving me in the foyer. I step forward towards the front door turn and put my back against the door looking into the room. Still dark but getting lighter by the second.

 I asked the wtf are you and why are you here into the room and got a bone chilling cold draft hit me in the face then listened to the stairs as if something was walking up them. She comes down a minute or two later and heads into the kitchen,. We are having some coffee and you can hear something moving upstairs. I asked again how long has this been going on at this level, this is intense. She says a couple years now. 

I have been gone working in Arizona, Florida, Louisiana, east Texas and now I'm back up around our daughters, they being WV me in Pennsylvania. I was shocked, I said a couple of years, she said yeah but it has picked up over the last 6 or so months. 

I have been back to that house probably 15 times since then and have not felt anything like that day,. Side note, she is getting divorced and has been moving back into her house in Glendale, a little town next to Moundsville.

 Whatever that thing was or is has attached itself or part of itself to me, or at least that's what I think has happened, abnormal things have been going on with me and around me. Coworkers watch and can't explain what's going on. They watch me struggle with something and not understand why it gave me such a fight, things moved right after I set it down, been different for sure. So um yeah that's one of my more recent encounters.

 At least with a solid black mass, it was kind of creepy how easy going my ex was about it, glad someone else had seen it but not really interested as to why it was happening. Ok if you got this far I thank you very much and have great week. I'll share more stories, they are older but good too with multiple witnesses in the house with us."
"An Unexpected Tug In The Night","Arizona","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","In 2014 I had been dating a guy who was a widower. While I didn't know the details of his wife's death, I did know it was a suicide. I didn't ask a lot of questions as I knew it was still very painful for him. He lived in the east valley of the Phoenix area in a ranch style house with a roommate and also several cats. Due to having said roommate and cats, he had a doggie door installed on the bottom of his bedroom door so he could still have privacy and the cats would be able to come in and out at their leisure. It was not uncommon to wake up and be surrounded by sleeping cats. 

One night we were watching TV at his place and I started to get tired. I went into his room and fell asleep, closing the door behind me. I was asleep on my left side in the fetal position when all of a sudden I was jolted awake in the middle of the night by what felt like a sharp tug backwards on my right shoulder. I immediately opened my eyes, completely expecting to see my boyfriend to my right. I said his name. No response. I reached a hand over to his side of the bed and he was not there. My eyes adjusted to the dark and I noticed that for once, I was not surrounded by sleeping cats, which was odd.

I laid very still and listened. My boyfriend was still out on the couch. He had fallen asleep out there and I could hear him snoring slightly. I didn't feel scared, just perplexed. I knew I hadn't dreamt that. Whatever it was woke me out of a sound sleep. In fact, I woke up with my shoulder still turned to the right. This was not a gentle shaking of one's shoulder to wake one either. This had been a full on tug, as if done with a sense of urgency or aggression. As I'm laying there, I suddenly felt as if someone had sat down on the edge of the bed next to me. I literally put my hand in the depression. Why I didn't go screaming out of the room, I don't know. I acknowledged the presence and strangely enough, I fell back to sleep. This time, without incident.

In the morning I told my boyfriend what had happened. He confessed to me that his late wife ended her life by taking a bunch of pills and going to sleep in that very bed. I had had no idea that's where it had happened. It never felt like one of those things I should ask for details on and thought he'd tell me when he was ready. I can only surmise it was her. He seemed to think that it was her spirit saying that she approved of me. I felt otherwise. 

While the relationship didn't last, I will never forget that experience. I moved out of state later that year and learned the following year he was tragically killed while out riding his motorcycle. It was heartbreaking to hear after the tragedy he had already been through. I really hope though that they are happy and have reunited on the other side."
"Phantom Sedan","Arizona","Haunted Places","Had an experience I figured was worth sharing as it left me a little spooked and perplexed!

I was recently out in Tuscon for a music festival with my close friend. We drove out from Colorado and unfortunately did so at night both ways and didn't get to enjoy the beautiful scenery along the way, but it made for easy driving. After the festival was over, we drove out to Mesa to see our friend from highschool and said our goodbyes as we prepared for the 12 hour drive home.

We left just after sunset and about 3 hours into the drive on a mountain pass (give or take around midnight) we were singing along to old 90's and early 2000's pop hits and cracking jokes and laughing so hard we had tears streaming down our faces. The moon wasn't full and we were surrounded by trees so it was really dark. As we hit a straight stretch of road on the pass, I could only see in front of the car as far as the headlights allowed and nothing behind us. There was nobody else on this road for miles but us, and I was suddenly hit with a weird feeling of uneasiness.

I had been checking my rearview mirror pretty often, as we were loaded down with camping gear and I wanted to allow faster cars to pass us, but at this point we hadn't seen anyone for nearly 30 minutes. I glanced in the mirror to the black void behind us and back ahead, and after a few seconds saw a light out of my peripheral vision and I looked up again. There was a small, dark sedan tailgating us, and really riding us close. Their driver side headlight was out and the other one was really yellowed and dim. I watched as they sped up and got right on my bumper, and I mean like less than 10 feet where it was uncomfortably close. I looked at my friend and laughed and pointed back with my thumb and said ""check out this ***hole, there's plenty of room to pass us!"" and when we both looked, the car was gone. Just the same darkness that had been there before and blur of tree silhouettes.

I told him what I had seen and described the car. He got goosebumps and said he had been feeling uneasy on that stretch of the pass too. Nothing else notable happened the rest of the drive, but it left a weird feeling in my gut until we made it into the next town. I have heard similar stories of ghost cars over the years but never seen it for myself until then. 

I wouldn't consider it to have been necessarily scary, but it definitely left me perplexed as I have no explanation for what happened and am curious as to the history of that stretch of road (if there were any fatal accidents, etc.) Can't remember exactly the name of the pass nor the road we were on but at some point I'd like to look it up and see if there's any articles about that pass."
"Something In The Basement","Alabama","Ouija Board / Seances","My home has an un-airconditioned basement that we use primarily for washing clothes, keeping the dogs, and storage. When it's not too hot or cold outside, I will go down there sometimes at night to do group chats with friends after my wife and kids have gone to sleep. One evening, while down there, an old Operation board game started making one of the noises over and over again. This was a version which had a funny sound for each of the organs to remove. It initially scared the crap out of me, but afterwards, I laughed about it and the guys on my group chat heard it and laughed too. It would do this randomly every so often for months at a time, using different sounds each time, over and over. I assumed that it was just the old board game slowly dying. My family all heard it as well.

Later, we began finding evidence of a rodent in our basement. I caught glimpses of it out of the corner of my eye and assumed, because of its size, speed, and ability to climb rapidly, that it was a squirrel, as we'd had them in the attic. It did a good deal of hidden damage, especially chewing up books or other research material, and we began to find nests all over the garage. We tried various means to get rid of it, including a variety of traps, poison and a sound emitter. Nothing worked. We eventually saw the culprit, which turned out to be a very large rat, but we could never catch it. It was able to climb vertically as fast as a squirrel; much faster than a rat should have been able.

It seemed to be abnormally intelligent, like, Rats of Nym, intelligent. It would get the bait from the traps without triggering them, and wouldn't eat the poison blocks. I put all the poison blocks in the rafters and ductwork to prevent the dogs from getting them. However, at some point, the rat pushed one of the blocks onto the floor, where one of our dogs found it, and we had to quickly take him to the veterinarian to induce vomiting and ensure he was okay. He made a full recovery.

During this same time frame, when I opened the basement door and turned on the lights, I would notice a shadow in the shape of a person at the bottom of the stairs, just for an instant before vanishing. Not always, but sometimes. I could turn the lights off and on again and it would not reappear. I assumed it was some weird electrical issue.

My daughter finally encountered the rat in the basement and killed it with her softball bat. I got rid of it and cleaned out the basement, and we thought that was the end of it. Only, another rat showed up in the next week or two and continued the damage and continued to elude death or capture.

Eventually, I started to think outside the box, as I had never really put any of the three phenomena (he rats, the shadow, and the Operation noises) together, but realized they had all occurred during the same time frame. I noticed that my old Ouija board was directly beneath the Operation game. I had not used it since high school. I researched Ouija boards and discovered that you are supposed to close sessions by moving the pointer to goodbye, and not to store the pointer on the board. I had never done that, although the board had not been used in more than 20 years, and I had never had any real encounters with it; just pushed it around to scare the other teenagers.

That evening, when I went home, I took it down and opened the box, and sure enough, I had left the pointer on the board, which I reckon left the connection open for all those years, until something found it and used it. I quickly moved the pointer to Goodbye, asking any presence to leave and not return, and saying a prayer. I then stored the pointer in the box, separated from the board. 

A few days later, we found the dying rat in a drawer, poisoned, and after cleaning the basement out again, have had no further rodent problems. The shadow stopped appearing at the bottom of the basement stairs as well, and the Operation game stopped making noises. I don't have any concrete evidence, or any real answers, but at this point, my hypothesis is that something found its way through the open Ouija board and somehow managed to manipulate the board game, the rats, and manifest as the shadow at the bottom of the stairs. Our home has been saged, and I grow sage in our basement as well, now. I have also done enough research to be able to respond if anything happens again."
"Illinois Lake House Haunting","Illinois","Haunted Places","It was the year of 2016 that I moved into a new home, a beautiful turn of the century brick mansion overviewing the local Decatur lake in central Illinois. This house was so large it was sectioned into a triplex, dividing it into 3 apartments, the main floor was my home. 

Soon after the move we noticed things falling and getting knocked off the table or couch when we weren't in the room. This happened a lot. I would walk into the kitchen and BOOM something fell in the living room. It was strange but we didn't really think much of it. About a month after moving in, I took a shower in the middle of the day, just as I finished and flung open the shower curtain my hair dryer across the room turned on simultaneously. 

How weird, I was slightly creeped out by this, but figured... Maybe it is the old house having electrical issues, maybe the moisture of my shower sparked something? Maybe static electricity? I was definitely creeped out but still did not feel the need to tell anyone and brushed it off as a coincidence. 

2 days later at 2 am, my boyfriend got up to pee while I was dead asleep, I was woken by a horribly LOUD rattling clunking sound that only lasted about 4 seconds followed by my boyfriends loud cursing. I shot up in bed, yelling ""WTH was that!?"" My boyfriend was panting and noticeably spooked. He said he was just taking a leak half asleep when out of nowhere his electric travel razer that was sitting on top of the porcelain water reservoir turner on. The vibration and rattling on the tank was ear numbingly loud at 2 am in the morning. ""Damn near gave me a heart attack, I didn't touch it or anything, I was just peeing and it just started buzzing, look! It isn't even plugged into the wall, how the hell does this even happen!?!"" 

I immediately had shivers down my spine, the hair dryer... I haven't even told him yet. 

The hair dryer turns on for me, the razor turns on for him, how creepy is this? My boyfriend and I were not really into paranormal things or believed in ghosts but here we were, THOROUGHLY creeped out in this old brick building. To make things more eerie, we found swastika and iron cross tiles imbedded around the old fire place which was a very strange thing to find in 2016. 

During one night at around 2-3 am we were both dead asleep and woken by a extremely loud BANG inside our room. It was so loud, my boyfriend shot up in his sleep and had his gun in his hand within a few seconds (he is a Marine). If I had to describe the bang, it sounded as if someone had a large stack of heavy books and dropped them from the ceiling to the floor. It was LOUD. The light switch was right above my head and as I switched it on I was expecting to see disarray, something broken or fallen on the floor or something knocked over, but there was nothing. Absolutely nothing. Not a thing out of order, we could never figure out what in the world made this loud bang. 

As the months passed my boyfriend and I broke up and I lived there alone, at night I frequently noticed that right at the moment I was drifting into a sleep, I would be woken by what felt like screaming directly into my ear and it was accompanied by what felt like electric jolts in my brain. It felt very wrong, violent and as if I was being attacked. 

These electric jolts almost felt like seizure activity and I started to worry that maybe I have developed a seizure disorder or a brain tumor. A month or so later, I had a date over for the first time, we were sitting on the couch talking when he suddenly interrupted me and said: ""I'm sorry, I don't want to seem weird or freak you out but I can't focus like this, do you by any chance believe in spirits or ghosts?"" 

I looked at him with this blank stare. 

He didn't know any of the weird things that have happened since I moved in. So I answered with ""well, not really, but since I moved here some weird things happened that kind of make me wonder"". He smiled and said ""I really really hope I won't deter you or make you think I am nuts, but I have been able to see spirits since I've been little and you definitely have one here, female, she is standing on your porch right now"" he looked uneasy and pointed at the screened in porch.

I think all the blood has drained out of my face at this point. I was so shook at what this stranger in my house just said. 

He continued to tell me that she is wearing a bathrobe and she used to live here... 50s maybe 60s, he said. ""She died here, in the bathroom, suicide in the bath tub""

I was just flabbergasted at this point. So as soon as he said all that I started telling him about all the things that have happened since I moved in and he validated all these occurrences as most certainly her doing. 

Shortly after, I moved out of the house and into a small 1 bedroom lake house across the lake. 

I never felt the strange electric jolts in my Twilight sleep again, and never had electric objects turn on or off or have things constantly falling to the floor. 

This only occurred in this house. 

The same guy that told me about the female spirit came and visited me about a month or two after I moved out. He told me how much he liked my new place and how it is such a better healthier place for me to live in. He continued to tell me, that he didn't want to make me uncomfortable or anxious at the time, but he is so glad I am out of that place, there was a darkness at this old house and the female spirit was NOT friendly, she wished me harm. 

I was never a believer in ghosts or spirits, but after this experience, I am 100% sure the place was haunted."
"My Mom Said The Next World Was Amazing With A Single Word","Ohio","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","My mother passed in 2001. She had always been interested in paranormal phenomena, like me. I had quite a few dreams after her death and they continue to this day, although increasingly rarely. An old dream dictionary I have says that the departed can reach us in dreams for up to 50 years following their passing - at least this is what the Ancient Greeks believed, evidently.

But what I want to write about here will be the first and only time I ""heard"" from her from the other side - literally heard her voice. 

Many kind relatives had come to the home we shared once she had died, to visit while attending the funeral. As is the tradition, they brought food. This made for some dishes to clean. At one point, everyone had left, to their respective hotels or the like, and I went to do the dishes. I had the water running when, momentarily, I heard my name called, in a cheerful, enticing way: ""Hon-ney!"" (Forgive me for substituting this for my actual name:-) Ah, one of the family members must have come back or forgotten something. I turned off the water and went to see who it had been. No one was there. Then it dawned on me... That had been my mother's voice. 

I had heard this excitement and encouragement all in one in her voice before. It meant she wanted to show me something really fun and amazing when she spoke in this tone in life.

My mom knew how curious I would be about the next world and how very concerned I was about her well being, first and foremost. To me, in this single word spoken in such a characteristically encouraging and inviting way - she let me know that all was well. And even better than well...amazing."
"Table Tapping In Gifted Science Class After School","Ohio","Misc","In 1976, I had been placed in a science class in middle school for gifted students. Our teacher presented a unit about the psychic sciences! As it turned out, he was a gifted automatic writer. I remember that various students in the class who studied foreign languages tested his automatic writing abilities and he got the short answers right in German and Spanish - languages he had never studied. 

One day after school, the teacher offered a sort of extra-credit activity where we could try table tapping. He placed a card table in the room, the desks had been put back along the walls to provide for some space. He began with three of us. There was a girl named M, and another girl named C, who happened to be the niece of a very famous French-Canadian actress, the teacher and I. Sure enough, one edge of the table would rise and fall gently in answer to questions! I do not recall what we asked but it always seems that when presented with such remarkable opportunities to ""ask anything"" no one can remember anything important to ask! So perhaps have such questions in your mind, beforehand. 

Our teacher left the table, as we really were incredulous about this phenomena, even though it was happening to us, and before our eyes! I think he wanted to show us it was not he, playing some sort of trick. His absence did not diminish the phenomena in the slightest, in fact, it seemed to intensify! At one point, the table began to move toward me, which caused me to back up, slightly. Then the table continued to move toward me and I found myself walking ever more quickly backward as it pursued me! The teacher then decided I might be doing this, intentionally, somehow! I wasn't, and I remember saying in response to his accusation, ""It's not me!"" 

Whatever had the table seemed more interested in chasing me than answering any questions we couldn't remember or were too embarrassed to ask in front of our classmates. Soon the experiment was over. I do think the teacher thought I had done something, but I truly had not! I never tried table tapping again and I really don't think I ever will!"
"My Parents Saw Me, But It Wasn't Me","Texas","Misc","I'm sorry this story will be quite short, in a way scary but most definitely curious.

Years ago when I was a teenager like many I lived at home with my parents. One night I got home after visiting with friends. I went to my parents room to let them know ""I'm home"". My father woke up and asked why I told them I arrived a second time, and added I had notified them I was home at least a half hour earlier. I asked, how could that be, I just got home.

Several years past and I was now an active duty soldier stationed in Ft. Drum, NY and living in Pulaski, NY. My parents were visiting since my wife and I had a new born and welcomed their help even for a little while. One morning I was heading out to my vehicle and went to work. My uniform was the standard issue woodland's cammo. My parents watched me get into my vehicle and leave. 

My father said they were still looking out the window and saw me again walking outside in a white uniform, I was never issued white uniforms and there were no other soldiers living in that building... Much less anyone else who looked like me.

Has anything like this happened to anyone and would anyone know what that could've been?

My father has had strong spiritual ties and has claimed to have been involved in spiritual warfare, he can't explain what they saw. He didn't feel threatened by it in either instance.

As a child I've traveled the astral planes through mirrors and have shut myself off from those gifts years ago. Could it be possible I may have brought something back?"
"Kids Of Ghosts","Texas","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","This is my first time writing about my stories. I always told to people I was close with, but none believed me; saying I'm crazy and it's just overthinking. I don't know if I'm really overthinking but I want to share my experiences on this platform and know the truth about them from people who believe in this. 

I was in Pakistan back then and my family was complete, but things started messing up. My parents fought daily, my grandfather got horribly sick, and my studies were affected of course. My dad thought my mom attracts spirits and she isn't normal. That she is psychic and purposely calls for demons. They fought mainly on this matter. He felt danger from her later on. He used to always tell me to stay away from her. I never understood that time and favored my mom more. 

Then, when my grandfather just got out from his recovery and came back home from hospital, we were all having a nice dinner (not really nice seeing there was rare communication between each other) but anyways, he pointed at our front door and said he can see someone. A girl. Then later two of them. I was beside him and I got up and stood with my dad because I was scared. Well, they disappeared then.

 Some weeks later, my grandfather got sick again. He was taken to hospital and passed away at night. He believed in ghosts and spirits a lot. I guess he used to communicate with them when he was a young adult. 

Then, after he passed away, I used to see shadows going all around the home. And it did freaked me out. They weren't shadows of birds or anything, but little kid figures. And one time I was with my friends in my room, we were total 3 and playing games on our phones. One of them turned around to look a bit outside the room, she heard something, then I also looked there, a little child wearing sort of red ran into my grandfather's room. He was no doubt really fast and neither of us could see his face. I thought its the neighbor's kid because they were same height and that kid mostly wore red too. I called his name and went to my grandfather's room. My friends followed me and told me to not explore so much because it can get worse. So we shrugged it off, well at least tried to, and then continued playing. 

Hearing kids noises, rhymes, footsteps running around the house was kind of creepy. Also, I was 12 or 13 that time."
"First Unexplained Phenomenons 2","Missouri","Shadow People","It has been a few years since I've updated on the occurrences I experienced in the apartment. I have moved to a house since then, and unfortunately, this has not stopped the the shadow figures/creatures from making themselves known. We're currently living in a three bedroom home with a single hallway leading to all of the bedrooms. When we moved here, I didn't feel any negative energy or the need to run up the stairs after turning off the light behind me (if you know what I mean). It's rather peaceful. I will say, however, that I'm still plagued with these nighttime shadows.

The first thing I experienced was about a month after we moved in. Our new bed is placed against a wall, and I sleep on the outside. There's a nightstand next to the bed and a small yellow lamp that sits atop it. The shape of the lamp is quite round, and I say this for visual effect on what I'm about to tell you. I awoke in the middle of the night, around three in the morning, and focused on the outside of the bed, facing the nightstand. There is some light that leaks through into the room from the streetlight outside. After my eyes were adjusted, I noticed something moving on the nightstand. What I can only describe to be a snake was coiled around the base of the lamp and was moving out of sight as I watched it. Its tail disappeared behind the lamp just as I jumped out of bed to turn on the lights in the room. Nothing was there, as usual. This was one of the most vivid ones I'd seen, as though I could reach out and touch it. It sent me reeling for a few hours. I really don't like snakes.

The next occurrence is something I've personally experienced a few times in my life. Some years back, I awoke to the feeling of my bed shaking. As odd as it sounds, this was nothing new to me, as I'd felt the sensation before and assumed it was a part of my dream leaking into reality. It turns out that we'd had an earthquake in the middle of the night, so ever since then, I've been more aware of when this happens. Because of this, when I woke up to my bed shaking a few months ago, I made sure to really take in my surroundings, in fear of it being an earthquake again. To my confusion, I heard two male voices in the hallway outside of our bedroom speaking in such low tones that I couldn't make out what they were saying. It almost seemed like they (or whatever they are) were aware that I was listening and didn't want me to hear them. The bed stopped shaking and I turned on the nightstand light, and as I did this, the voices seized to exist. There is no one else that lives with us in the house, and my husband was sleeping next to me. I found it odd, but it didn't frighten me so much.

Around the same time, I had another nighttime occurrence. I woke up on my back facing the ceiling. When I was able to focus, I saw what appeared to be an enormous wasp or hornet bouncing against my ceiling. It was summer, and honestly, it would make logical sense for something like this to happen. I watched as it bounced a few more times and then turned on the light in order to run out of the room away from it; but when I looked up as the room was well lit, the bug was gone. I searched the entire room, because I have a huge fear of bugs that sting, but could not find it. There's no way it could have escaped that fast, so I concluded that it must have been another shadow creature.

The last and most recent thing that happened involved a snake, yet again, to my dismay. When I woke up in the middle of the night, I was facing outward towards the room. I looked at our sliding closet doors and saw something. This is a bit difficult to explain, so bear with me. The snake was caught between the two sliding doors, and was defying gravity by sticking it's body out horizontally from between them. It was hissing and moving as though it was floating in air and only its tail was attached to the doors. Even my brain couldn't make sense of it. As usual, once the light was on, the creature disappeared.

There is a large part of me that thinks this is something to do with my dreams leaking into reality still. That, or I'm haunted by creatures that frighten me, which is a nightmare in itself. Of course, I would love to hear your opinions, thoughts, and ideas down below. Please feel free to ask any questions and I will try to monitor the feed this time! 

Thanks for reading!:)"
"Gettysburg Ghost Experience","Pennsylvania","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I've had numerous paranormal experiences in Gettysburg. This is one of the scariest. 

I was near the Rose Farm, off of Confederate Avenue, looking for the location of a New York Artillery Battalion. It was August, hot, muggy; just typical summer weather... It wasn't super windy, but there was a nice breeze blowing. As I walked through the trees, I could hear leaves rustling, birds singing; just normal summer sounds. I followed a narrow path leading to the cannon site, which is about 150 feet into the woods. At first, I didn't notice anything strange, but suddenly I realized there was absolutely no sound AT ALL. Even though I could see the trees moving in the breeze, it was dead silent. And COLD, like I had stepped into a freezer. I stopped, unsure if I should keep going or turn around and leave.

 I should point out here that even though I've had many paranormal experiences in my life, I don't scare easily, but what happened next sent me running like a scared rabbit.

 I saw a flicker of movement out of the corner of my eye, but when I turned to look, there was nothing there. At least nothing I could SEE. I heard the sound of a match being struck, smelled tobacco, and a voice said clear as day (and very close to my ear), ""You don't belong here. Get out!"" At that moment, the silence broke with the sound of a cannon firing and I took off like the Devil himself was chasing me. I sat in my car, shaking, trying to gather my wits and process what had happened. Once I calmed down, I drove back to town and talked to one of the Park Rangers. I don't recall the gentleman's name, but he told me I wasn't the first person to have that experience.

A couple years later, in 2008, I went back to the site with a friend. This time, we both experienced what I had 2 years before. We have been to Gettysburg several times since that day, but neither of us went anywhere near the Rose Farm again."
"Noises And Unexplained Happenings In Old Victorian: Year 3","Massachusetts","Haunted Places","Side note: I have many photos of this house which I can post if anyone is interested to see any of the rooms in the house, up and down, if you have read my other installments. 

This is a continuation of a three-part story. I neglected to write this when I wrote the other two installments because many of these events did not happen to me personally, but to various guests whom had stayed over in the house.

So I was in my final year of graduate school, and I was renting a room in an old Victorian house, built around 1890. This would have been the third year in which I lived in this house. The first, I lived downstairs. The next, I moved upstairs. This final year, I moved back downstairs. 

During my first year in the house, much of the activity had centered around the staircase, and the rooms directly underneath it, which consisted of two closets separated by a partition wall and my old room. I now lived in the large front room of the house, which had two beds in it, and I had one roommate in the front room. My old room had one person, and the tiny cramped closet under the stairs was converted into an extremely cramped bedroom for the final roommate.

That closet was where much of the activity seemed to be concentrated my first year in the house. But ever since the creepy closet was converted to a ""bedroom"" (if you can even call it that), and nearly every inch of the space was taken up by a mattress, television, and clothes, the negative energy in the house moved toward the bathroom and laundry room directly off the living room, which was located only feet away. It's as if the entities were forced to relocate! For some bizarre reason, the door to the bathroom had two glass panes, which would ordinarily have made it possible to see directly into the bathroom from the living room, but to provide privacy to people using the bathroom, a bedsheet was placed on the inside which hung over the window, blocking the view.

I worked very late on most evenings, and walking into the house from the side door, which opened into that same living room, was creepy. The room has four doors off it, and many windows on all sides. It felt as if at any moment something could jump out from behind a door or from the dark corners of the room. When I would come home I would quickly run to my room and shut the door, and try not to come out until morning for any reason. 

When I would leave the front bedroom and walk into the rest of the house at night, I would have a persistent feeling of being watched from that bathroom. I felt as if I had a microscope on me, being watched from all sides. As I ran through the living room back to my room, my heart would be racing and I had the feeling as if I was being followed closely behind, and even though I could not hear nor see anything, I felt as if something was right behind me, only centimeters away. The feeling was frequent and oppressive. Sometimes I would quickly turn around, wave my arm in front of me as if trying to swat an invisible entity away, and I would be directly facing the door to this bathroom, and on a few occasions, I would see the bedsheet covering it rustling back and forth as if someone had been in the bathroom peering at me. 

One night as I walked back from the kitchen grabbing a glass of water, I swore that I saw glowing yellow eyes at ground level in the corner of the living room behind the television, staring out at me. But when I blinked and looked again, I no longer saw them. I know what I saw, and I tried to come up with any explanation for this, but there was nothing which could've cast such a shadow. This was very unsettling and made me feel sick. 

My one roommate, who lived in the front room with me, had only just moved in this year. He regularly complained of a sensation of being watched from the front closet off our room and from the windows outside, and that on several occasions, he would wake up randomly in the night feeling as if he had been shaken awake by an unseen entity, but that when he would open his eyes, I was asleep at the other end of the room and there was no one else there. This roommate ended up leaving halfway through the year for study abroad. 

About one month after he left, I purchased an expensive perfume, which I opened and tested, but then placed back into its box. I placed the box on the mantle of the fireplace in my room, since my room had a fireplace and I used that to arrange my perfumes, lotions, body sprays. One day when I opened the box to use the perfume about one week later, I was shocked and upset to find the perfume bottle completely shattered down the middle, all of the perfume evaporated, but the box was exactly where it had originally been placed. I asked every single roommate if one of them had knocked it off the fireplace and was too ashamed to tell me, but they insisted they had not. What was even more shocking was that the bottle wasn't shattered in a way you'd expect if it had fallen. It was cracked exactly down the middle. 

Other times, items would go missing, and some would never turn up again. Toward the end of the year, when I was applying for jobs, I had a folder of all of my paperwork which I might need. I had my Social Security card, various copies of my IDs, etc. I placed the folder in a locked cabinet in my desk. When I needed its contents, I checked to ensure everything was in there, but my Social Security card was missing. I distinctly remembered it being in there, I put it in there and had just checked several days prior, but it was missing. No one else had the key to the cabinet, and there was no sign of the lock being tampered with. I never found the card again, and I had to quickly order a replacement.

Another frequent occurrence, which never occurred my other years living in the house, was the water in the shower getting excruciatingly cold when I was in there. It happened to all of us. I called a plumber, but his inspection of the hot water heater revealed no issues, and the upstairs tenants did not report anything similar. This happened repeatedly and it was very annoying. I would end up taking very quick showers in hope that the water would not suddenly go cold. 

There was also a regular smell of cinnamon in the downstairs, as if someone had lit a cinnamon-scented candle. But no one had. The smell would randomly appear, and then disappear. This did not bother me, as I love the scent of cinnamon, but I always wondered where it was coming from and could not locate the source.

My roommates all insisted that none of these things were happening and it was all in my head. Whenever I tried to persuade them that there was something not quite right about the house, and that something strange was happening in our apartment, they refused to listen. They had begun doubting my sanity, and so had I. It took one event to rattle them and at least raise their suspicions. The final event which was relayed to me by others, which I was not present for, and took place during spring break. One of the roommates had returned early because he had a job interview, and was woken up early in the morning by what sounded like a smoke detector coming from the upstairs apartment, which although was not in close proximity, was loud enough to wake him. He ran out the front door to knock on the upstairs tenants' door to make sure everything was okay. They stated that there was no smoke anywhere, and that although the smoke detector had gone off, they checked every room and there was nothing amiss. Within minutes, the smoke alarm downstairs began to sound, despite the fact that they are battery-operated and not connected to a centralized electrical source in the house. My roommate checked every room but what puzzled him was, the sound was not coming from any of the detectors on the ceiling. If it had been, it would have sounded louder when standing directly underneath. It was emanating from an unidentified location and seemed to be equally loud in every room, and seemed to get louder, and louder, and louder. My roommate said that the noise got so unbearably loud that he put his hands on his ears, buried his head in his pillow, and began feeling like he was about to pass out... And then suddenly the noise stopped. He never heard it ever again.

We only had several weeks left in the house, but nothing else happened apart from the feeling of being watched, and just an overall sensation of darkness lingering over the house. I think about the house often and wonder who had lived there before, and what the entities wanted. I do not think they were particularly malicious, but they were clearly trying to get my attention. I just believe it was a very haunted house, with a lot of residual energy and spirits who enjoyed playing pranks. Maybe the constant influx of college students into the home was unsettling for them as well as all of the renovations over the years, I cannot say. I drive by the house often and wonder if anyone else has experienced anything similar, or if it was just me."
"The Rocking Swing","Texas","Haunted Items","I had a paranormal experience that I shared on this site 5 or 6 years ago (I think the title was ""The Thing By The Shed). I was cleaning up around my storage shed and bent over to pick something up when I saw something that looked like a stick laying on a cement pad. I didn't look directly at it but when I reached down whatever this thing was popped into an arc-like shape and made a cracking sound at the same time. Then it seemed to jump under the storage shed, which is on piers. I was like WTH just happened? I ran to get a flashlight but when I returned I didn't see anything under the shed. To this day I have no clue whatsoever as to what that was. But after that nothing strange happened at my house until 2 years ago.

 We had a large covered swing we had bought from Lowe's in our yard and one day I was walking towards the swing when it started swinging very hard all by itself. It swung about 3 times and stopped. For some reason I pretended that nothing had happened as I walked by. I don't know if I ignored it thinking that I didn't want whatever it was that caused it to swing to know that I was acknowledging it or if I just wasn't surprised after the first experience several years earlier. Anyway, nothing else happened until several months later. One day I was walking towards the swing and it did the EXACT same thing! Again I pretended not to notice but inside I was pretty stoked! I'm hoping it was the spirit of my elderly neighbor who I was close to that had passed away about 10 years ago. I feel like she was letting me know that she was watching over us. If it wasn't her then I'm thinking maybe it was another spirit that was just passing through. I don't know...

 But what does worry me sometimes is that we buy a lot of antique and vintage items and figure one day we will buy something with a Spirit attached to it."
"A Visit From Two Legs","Iowa","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","Around the year of 2010 a friend of mine called me asking if I would be interested in house sitting, and watching his two cats as well, for about a month as he was going into the hospital for medical treatments. I accepted immediately. When I first entered his place I felt a heaviness but kept that silent. He gave me a tour of the place. I refused the basement and his bedroom. Both had a horrible sense to me. 

After he left I proceeded to work on a list of things I wanted to help him out with in his home. Later on I worked on settling a bit in the spare room he had for me to stay in. One day as I was organizing some of my things in the spare room both the cats came bolting in by me and hid under the bed. I knew they got wound up but that was fear. So I looked up towards the living room where they had ran from and there walking across the floor in the sun's rays from the window, was a pair of man's legs. Just the legs. They had mechanics pants on, plus old boots. They walked slowly towards the front door. I didn't leave the room for a while. Now I'm not afraid of Ghosts/Spirits but this one had a very uneasy feel to him. I'm guessing this may be what I sensed from the start. 

After my friend returned from the hospital we sat and chatted about what happened. Which brought up the basement and his bedroom. He himself was very hesitant to go into the basement. As for his room, he indicated that when he moved in there were strange writings all over his walls. Which he painted over. I sure wish he'd taken pictures."
"Has This Pair Of Earrings Provoked A Haunting? - 2","New York","Misc","Since I first noticed the paranormal activity taking place in my house and at my workplace, I've had a few more encounters.

 In my last post with this title, I referenced something I termed ""the draft"" which may or may not be the manifestation of my grandma since everything started after I began wearing a pair of her earrings. When the draft first started, it seemed to be erratic. It came and went randomly; there didn't seem to be a pattern, but that has since changed. Recently, it's been coming to me every night at anywhere between 2:00am and 2:30am. It wakes me up but never for long. When it comes to me during the day, it's always in the same room of my house when I'm studying. As a student, I spend quite a bit of time studying, and it can cause quite a bit of stress. When I'm stressed and studying, I tend to feel the draft touch my right arm in particular. It doesn't feel like it has an actual shape to it like a hand or anything, but it is concentrated on my right arm. 

On January 20th, I was woken up at 2:00am by the draft like I am every night. But before then, I was having an odd dream. I was home alone, and I heard someone walking down the stairs, so I consciously made the decision to go investigate. (I'm prone to lucid dreaming so I can often control what I do in my dreams). When I got to the stairs, I saw one of my mom's shirts, a pair of her pants, and a pair of her shoes just sitting there at the bottom. There was no physical person. I then heard someone turn on the shower, so I went to investigate that. There was no one there, but sure enough the shower was on. I texted my mom to tell her, and she came home a few minutes later. We looked at her clothes on the stairs, and she was just as confused as I was. When I woke up, I didn't see anything, but I felt the cold draft sensation on my right cheek. I don't know if this dream was some form of communication. I generally dismiss dreams, but I've never had one like this. Any thoughts?

On January 23rd, I woke up at 1:07am. My dad had been out late the night before, so I checked outside to see if his car was there. It was, so I went back to sleep, but didn't stay asleep. I woke up at exactly 1:37 and my door was open a crack, so I could see my dad come out of the bathroom and go into his bedroom, but there was someone else there. There was a short, hunched over figure following him. He didn't seem to be aware of it. It was short and female, but definitely not my mom. I couldn't make out any other features. I wasn't really alarmed by it, but I was wide awake. I stayed awake for a while after that, and at 2:15ish, there was the draft again touching my right arm. I immediately felt calm and more tired and fell asleep again shortly after. I'm not sure if the dream and the figure are related to the draft or not. It seems to be an ongoing situation."
"Saw A Ghost, Alarm Going Off, Flickering Lights","Ohio","Haunted Places","I am just looking for some answers or just some help with these few things I have experienced. So I would really appreciate any feedback that you guys have.

 I just moved out of my old house less than a week ago. I had a few things happen in that house. I had a lamp in my bedroom that was constantly turning on, whenever I turned it off.

 My parents are also divorced so whenever I wasn't at that house, the alarm clock in my bedroom would go off. It would go off all hours of the day. My dad was constantly having to go and turn it off. We had no idea what was causing this.

 I also had two things happen in the middle of the night. One night I woke up and I was freezing. I rolled over to get a blanket and I saw a ghost-like figure standing in the middle of my room. To this day I still remember exactly what the ghost looked like, it has been about a year since that happened. Then the next night after that, I woke up freezing again. I rolled over and saw the ghost laying in bed next to me. I was so scared and just hid under the blankets and went back to sleep. 

We recently moved into our new house, and the renters in our old house have been telling us about all these things happening. They said that in the living room the curtains were swinging back and forth, and the strings that hang from a fan were swinging back and forth hitting each other. This was shocking because we knew there was something in that house but had never experienced anything that big. Another thing that happened was that a locked door opened. Also in the middle of the night, one of the women woke up and felt someone brushing the top of her head, parting her hair. 

It hasn't even been a week since we moved out, and it's shocking that they are seeing things this quickly. 

I decided to submit this story just to see if anyone could help, or had any explanation for these things"
"Warn Bobby","California","Ouija Board / Seances","When I was about 10 years old, my mother and a next-door neighbor named Margaret Lowery, in Palo Alto (alleged to be a medium) were on the Ouija together one night. We'd often go over to our neighbor Margaret's house to do this, and my older brother would also attend, and several of his friends as well. 

Most evenings, we'd have a regular spirit contact that the participants would reach named just ""Kim"", who had all sorts of interesting things to say. 

On this particular evening, a different contact came through, instead of our usual contact named ""Kim"", and spelled out its name as simply ""John"". Nothing else. Just ""John"". 

After a pause, a remaining message came through, and was in retrospect rather chilling, for at the time we didn't know what ""John"" meant when

He said these two words...""Warn Bobby"". We didn't know anyone in our immediate family named ""Bobby"", so we were rather puzzled by this ""John"" contact, and what it had to convey to us all. 

It would become very clear that this ""Bobby"" that ""John"" was referring to was not a personal contact for us at all, but one personal to himself, and was also well-known to the entire United States, if not the entire world. For about a week later, we'd learned that a man called Sirhan Sirhan had assassinated Bobby Kennedy. 

We were stunned, however not immediately, at the time of the contact from ""John"", for at the time it had no particular meaning for any of us attending that Ouija session, but when the news came out of Robert Kennedy's assassination, we were left with a sinking feeling, for how could we have told anyone to ""Warn Bobby"", even if we had known who ""Bobby"" was at the time? With so many ""Johns"" and ""Bobby's"" in the world, were we contacted by John F. Kennedy, warning us of his younger brother's imminent demise? We will never know for certain, but will always wonder.

At Death's Door Paranormal Investigations"
"The Picture Frame","North Carolina","Haunted Places","This story is completely true. It happened when my family and I lived in a house that had A LOT of paranormal activity. This is one of the many reasons we decided to move. You have to know the entire story to understand, this is just part of it. 

I have a husband and two girls. My girls were pretty young at the time. I would say 4 and 8. We had went on vacation and were returning home. Upon arriving, I decided to get the girls in the bath and cook dinner. I was walking back and forth between the master bathroom and the kitchen. That's when I saw it. 

A picture of our youngest on the top of our bookshelf had been completely turned around. Now, this wasn't like it had been tampered with and somebody just put it back haphazardly. No. This picture frame was deliberately turned around to where the picture of my little girl was facing the bookshelf and the back of the frame was facing outward. Perfectly. I mean it was neat. Straight. Placed back in perfect symmetry to the rest of the pictures and in the exact same spot. Just completely backwards. 

When I saw it, it took my breath away. My beautiful baby, there amongst all the other pictures, but hers turned around. It seemed so dark. I tried not to over react. I thought logically. Ok. Obviously, it was the kids. But the kids couldn't reach that high. Not without a ladder and they had not been on a ladder. And I mean I'm with them ever single minute of every single day. 

Next would be my husband. I found him. And brought him to look at the bookshelf. His reaction? He gasped too. I don't think he meant to. He's not one to over react. But like I said, it just seemed dark. He said he didn't do it. And I mean what motivation would a loving father have to do that to a picture of a child?

I know it wasn't like that before we left for our vacation. It didn't take me long to spot it. It would have stuck out like a sore thumb. No one had been in our house. We had a security system so we literally knew no one had been in our house. 

We had been feeling paranormal things for a while. It had literally gotten to the point that I would shout and say, ""Stop It!"" when something paranormal would happen. Pictures fell off the wall All. The. Time. Footsteps could be heard All. The. Time. My kids were crazy scared All. The. Time. Dreams, visions, sightings... You name it. 

I began to think that whatever it was, was targeting my kids. And I was ready to get the heck out of dodge. This was my final straw. I finally talked my husband into it and mixed with a few other things going on, we decided to sell. 

Since then, nothing. My kids are happy and aren't terrified. There have been almost zero paranormal issues (aside from the lights turning on twice which could have been caused by nearly anything electrical). My house is peaceful. I never really realized how terrified I was in that house until I got out. I'm so at peace here it's amazing. 

Have you experienced anything like this? Where your kids were targeted? I've always heard that places aren't haunted, people are. But that place is definitely haunted. I also forgot to mention that the people we bought the house from have a YouTube channel where they tell their own ghost stories about that house. We, of course, had no idea when we bought it!"
"Across The Miles","Ohio","Misc","It's been awhile since I've submitted anything. Not that there hasn't been activity in my home or experiences that I could share, it's just YGS and my paranormal life had to take a backseat to my real life. The following is one experience I have been meaning to share for a while. 

Saturday morning, March 9, 2019, I was laying in bed trying to convince myself I really should get up and start my day. I'd been awake since 7:30 but had no desire to do anything other than lay there. Being productive was not on my list of things to do. 

At 9:10a, I heard and felt the word ""dammit"" from underneath my pillow. I've been experiencing similar things since 2015 and have become accustomed to hearing a word or two come from under my pillow so this didn't freak me out. Kids were asleep; no one else in my home except our non-living housemates. 

While waiting to see if I could hear anything else, the thought ran through my mind that I needed to check with Manafon, one of our members who had shared a similar experience with me (https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=25921). I got up and sent an email to Manafon asking if he had experienced anything close to the same time. 

""Well, I've been staying at a customer's house and the dog I'm taking care of was being REALLY bad at that time. If you picked up on a guy in America being really angry at a dog, that was me. What did you experience? I did hear what sounded like footsteps coming down the hall to the room I was staying in last night. I think you may have tapped into my anger too."" I didn't hear the footsteps and if I had, I would have just assumed it was one of our non-living housemates. 

Manafon and I both realize this could be coincidence; however, considering we had a shared, albeit long-distance, experience maybe it's more than a coincidence. I have also had shared experiences with other YGS members: Zzsgranny, cosmogal, BadJuJu, and ausiedazz. Those experiences I wouldn't share without their agreement."
"Lady In Blue","Oregon","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I was at the church in the ghost town of Golden, Oregon yesterday (Jan.7, 2022). At 12:26pm I walked alone through the church door and nearly bumped into a woman to my right, whom was wearing a calico dress of light blue flowers. I jumped and made a sound, which my husband (who was right outside) heard and saw. She was tall like me. I noticed her long sleeved, high necked blue dress, but she disappeared before I could see her head and face. At first I thought she was another visitor whose presence I was merely unaware of at the site. But she disappeared instantly when I jumped. I snapped a photo of the pulpit, then went outside & told my husband & the curator who were standing there. I was unaware of any ""ghost sightings"" at Golden, and have never seen a ghost anywhere before yesterday! I went home and started researching. I would be interested in any story of a similar sighting, especially at the Golden Ghost Town.

I only have 1032 characters, so I need to type a bit more before my story can be published. I mentioned I have never seen a ghost before, but I AM sensitive and intuitive. I have seen large, male hands superimposed over mine when I was driving alone at night, and when I rubbed my husband's shoulders in the hospital a few days before he died.

5 years ago in Houston, Texas I saw a flash of light in my friend's kitchen the morning of her son's wedding. Then I heard (telepathically),""I'm Grandpa Joe! You can hear me?"" He started talking very fast, so I said aloud, ""Slow down. I'm going to take notes. I am new to this and not very good."" Moments later my friend walked in and confirmed she called her maternal grandfather ""Grandpa Joe""!"
"Recycled Spirits/the Old Refrigerator Of Doom And Stuff!","California","Haunted Places","Did you like the title? I thought that it was clever. This ""ghost story"" or whatever you want to call it has some laughs in it - particularly at my expense. There's definitely some spookiness to it though, too, so don't worry. It won't keep you up at night, though. Unless you spend your nights trying to explain it away like I did. Now you're probably asking ""Explain what dammit?!?"" so let's begin.

A few years ago I was a security guard. A ""night watchman"" as it were. If you read about ""real"" ghost stories or watch YouTube videos on the subject then you've probably noticed that a lot of that stuff comes from security guards. I blame the internet and stupidity on night guards thinking everything is haunted. 

In my six day work week, I guarded three different locations from 2 p.m. To 12 a.m. Each with its own warnings of haunting from my co-workers. No post was more notorious than the recycle yard that I watched on Fridays and Saturdays. 

By the time of my eerie encounter I had already been at that post two days a week for six months. Countless guards had come and gone. Some asked for day shifts, others refused to continue the assignment and a few quit outright. That was the most ""haunted"" place I'd heard of in my years as a night watchman. The stories were also the funniest. 

""The motion detecting lights turn on - "" some guards would say ""but when I go to look for who is there, nobody is there!""

Duh. That's because it was a recycle yard in the open air. There are cats and rats and birds and skunks and all sorts of suburban wildlife running around there at night.

""I saw a strange looking thing in there one night. It was like a man, but it was decrepit and sickly looking. It made weird noises. It was like a zombie!""

Yeah. Welcome to Southern California. In the ghetto. That's a drug addict. It's a really big part of your job to keep them off of the property. You didn't do your job very well.

My absolute favorite ""haunting"" scare didn't I didn't hear directly from one of my co-workers. I heard it from my boss. I got a call one Sunday - my ONLY day off - and she asked me to cover the 10 p.m.-6 a.m. Shift. The new guard quit her shift after one night because when the sun came up, the SPOOOOKY GHOSTS CAME OUT! The containers started popping and everything made noise and there was nobody there and she cried and hid in her car to save herself from the evil spirits! Let me remind you that this was a recycling yard. Metal was everywhere. The metal to be recycled was kept in containers that were themselves metal. Night is cooler, day is warmer. The sun rises, the metal expands and creaks and pops. I knew that, my boss knew that, but the now retired 8 hour night watch veteran didn't know that. So, I got stuck with a seven day work week.

That Sunday night was a frightening one for me, though. I remember being in the car and on the phone with my boss pleading with her to just let me stay in my car. The company assigned had patrol tracking devices to every site and she called because I hadn't hit any of the checkpoints in over an hour. I was refusing, she was threatening to fire me. I said to her ""If they just kept the copper inside the building in the middle of the place they wouldn't get robbed so much. If they didn't keep the copper outdoors in big, opened containers with the word ""COPPER"" painted on them in giant letters, they probably wouldn't even need a guard! But they do those things, so I feel as though I am possibly in mortal f*cking danger!""

There was a massive thunderstorm. I was a new father and I was worried that the copper would attract the lightning and that I would die if I happened to be passing by. My boss and the client agreed to let me avoid going near the copper for the duration of the storm. Lightning never did strike the yard that night. You thought that I was talking about a ghost or something, huh? Got ya. No, that wasn't until later. When I was on my regular shift.

I went in on a Saturday afternoon at 2 p.m. As per usual. I did my patrol as per usual that afternoon. I fed the junkyard cats some tuna. As per usual. There was something unusual in the yard, however. In between two of my checkpoints lay a small refrigerator and what looked like a giant pocket watch the size of a wall clock. I didn't like the feeling of being around them. 

There was an orange and white kitten who used to follow me around for a while after tuna time. I named him Rebel, because he was the only one of the junkyard cats who would get close to me besides his mom. He got really close. Never close enough for me to pet him. He'd run if I tried, so I stopped trying. He was following me that afternoon as I was passing by that refrigerator and clock. I stopped there. Being around those things scared me. I couldn't admit it then and I can barely admit it now. I hate the idea of admitting that I'm afraid. Being afraid of inanimate objects for no discernable reason is the height of humiliation. That's why I decided in that moment to inspect the objects and reassure myself that there was nothing to be afraid of. I was so steadfast in my resolve that I wasn't sure why I was still standing there several feet away. 

""What do you think, Rebel?"" I asked the kitten standing near me. Unsurprisingly, he didn't answer. ""An ice box and an old clock."" I said dismissively as I walked away without laying a hand on the objects. I continued to feign indifference toward the fridge and clock throughout the afternoon. It wasn't until shortly after dark that I no longer needed to pretend. 

There were voices in the yard that night. That wasn't out of the ordinary. I'd often have to confront the addicts, the homeless, the thieves, the hooligan teenagers and, on occasion, the thieving, drug addicted homeless, teenaged hooligans. (TDAHTH vs. TMNT. I smell a franchise!) The encounters were usually very casual and respectful. I'd find an intruder and say ""Sir/Miss, this is private property. I'm going to have to escort you out."" At that particular site, that worked all but one time. A young man who I caught trying to steal the battery from a forklift in broad daylight charged at me with a pry bar. I picked up a rebar and ran straight back at him while screaming like a crazy person. If you're thinking that I shared that bit only to illustrate that I don't scare easily, you are correct. 

I followed the voices back and forth on my patrols for hours that night. I couldn't catch where they were. It sounded like two men whispering, so I assumed that I was dealing with very sneaky and clever thieves. The yard was sort of ""U"" shape. There were walls all around. There was a building to which I did not have access in the middle and high walls all around. But, there was scrap everywhere. Any time I lost the voices, I would try to worm through the junk to see where they'd lost me. 

I was doing my best not to collapse onto the ground and throw a toddlerish tantrum as I squeezed my body between two stacks of pallets and made my way back to my car to sit and sulk like a grown man does when he is out-smarted when I heard the voices again. I had them this time. The voices were coming from near the pile of car bumpers which I guess were somehow recyclable. No, not the pile near the entrance gate. Not the one by the mobile container full of copper which had ""COPPER"" (i.e. ""come and steal this"") written on its side in bright orange letters. It was the pile underneath the solar-powered yard light. I had them! And by God, I was going to use all of the power granted to me by the bottom tier security company for which I worked and the yard owner who couldn't just buy a f*cking dog to very politely ask them to leave!

I approached the bumper pile slowly - mighty flashlight in hand - and saw nothing. But, I still heard the men whispering. I circled around the mass of junked bumpers, anxiously awaiting the moment that these intruders realize that I outsmarted them and prepare themselves for a stern asking of when finally... I saw that I was back where I started. I circled the whole thing and I didn't see them. But, I could still hear them. It was at that moment that I realized that the voices weren't saying anything. Not in any language that I know.

""Sp ssp ha huh ha ss ss sssee ssah""

""Kah kuh sah sah vlenimeno mino"" is the best that I can do to transcribe what I remember hearing all those years ago.

""Uh-"" this was me and requires no guessing or translation ""You can't be here.""

It was quiet for a few seconds. Or minutes. I don't know. It got quiet after I spoke. The silence was eventually broken by a tumbling sound and a very un-manly yelp by yours truly as the bumper pile fell and three (yes, I counted) of them flew out in my direction. One from the middle, one from bottom and one from the top shot toward me like daggers as I jumped backwards and landed flat on my *ss. I sat there with aforementioned a*s and hands on the dirt until I caught my breath and felt confident that I could pretend the whole thing didn't happen.

After what felt like an eternity, I pushed myself up off of the ground and dusted off my uniform. It was gravity+cats×birds- a statue of John Wayne on every street corner that made that happen, right? Because I'm an American and this is America dod gammit and we aren't afraid of any what! That's just science! Yeah!

Except maybe ""nah"", because I still felt really uneasy. And I didn't want to look to my right. I also didn't want my kids to find out that I was afraid, which I was sure they somehow would have, so I glanced a bit that way. There was no way - absolutely NO WAY that I could see what I saw and be where I was. That's what I told myself. However, the only person who lies to me worse than my youngest daughter is me, so I didn't believe that *sshole. I yanked my eyes away from my shoes and saw that I was standing right next to an ice box and an old clock. I had been trying so hard to stay away front that area that it was actually a little difficult to believe that I had got so caught up in chasing invisible intruders that I didn't even realize that I was there. 

""No. Nobody. F*ck no. No way. Nope. No."" I remember exactly what I said when I saw that the refrigerator was open and the clock's face was on the ground. I was actually scared beyond fear. Despite the chill running up my spine, I had to go see that this wasn't real. I stomped toward that old refrigerator and got my hands all over it. I looked it over inside and out and I found nothing unusual. Except for the fact that I was trembling the entire time and I couldn't stop it. I glanced over at the bumpers near me every now and then. The ones that were blown over by an isolated gust of wind that I couldn't hear or feel and that effected nothing else. They were very still, as I always knew that they would be. There were also no voices, because there never were and I was just sleep deprived or hungry or something. Obviously. 

I moved on to the clock. That's when Rebel showed up again. He popped up out of nowhere onto a nearby concrete block and stared at me, as was typical. 

""Nothing here, Rebel - "" I said to the cat and definitely not as a way to reassure myself. Not at all. Shut up. "" - Just an old WHAT THE F*CK?!?!"" I dropped the clock and ran away. Rebel ran alongside me toward for a second or two when I broke for my car. I lost sight of him before I made it to my little safe place, but I thought that was interesting. It was like he and I were human and cat bros. 

Oh, yeah, you probably want to know what made me freak out. The hands on the clock were spinning. They were just going crazy. That probably doesn't seem too SpoooOOOOoooOooKY, but it scared the hell out of me. You had to be there to feel the fear. 

You may not have been, but someone else was and someone else felt it. The next week I saw that the clock was still near where it had been before, but it looked as though it had been bashed in with a hammer. The refrigerator was tossed over the East wall.

The lesson that we can all learn from this is that you should not be a bloody security guard."
"My Interaction With A Ghost","New Hampshire","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I was younger when this happened, so it's been a good while. I apologize in advance if I get any details wrong or don't quite remember some.

This took place in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Just a quick google search will show you that this place is old.

It was around evening. My Mother was making dinner in the kitchen, and I was playing Minecraft whilst my younger brother watched. I had suddenly felt a cold hand being placed on my shoulder, then another hand traveling up the back of my neck, lightly touching the back of my hair. I whipped around to see who it was, but no one was there. I then asked my younger brother if he did it, but I knew his arm wasn't long enough to reach around our desk chair like that, and the hands were too big to be his. 

Our house was newer than other houses in the area but still older definitely and creepy, so it wasn't the first time that something that could be labeled as paranormal had happened, it was just the first, and last time I had been physically touched by the ghost here. 

I would see shadow figures on the walls, feel as though I was being watched and simple things being moved or falling. It was especially prominent in the basement, which makes me think that maybe our house had been built over something. Though, this ghost never seemed unfriendly. They had never tormented us, just did little things to get our attention. 

If I'm being honest, it felt more like this ghost was watching out for us. I never felt like I was in danger when in their presence, just more not understanding what was happening. 

If you're willing, let me know your thoughts in the comments. I'm genuinely curious as to what more experienced people have to say on this.

"Has This Pair Of Earrings Provoked A Haunting?","New York","Haunted Items","It initially just seemed like a series of coincidences until I took a closer look at the timing of everything. 

It started about a month ago with objects around me, that were in no danger of falling, just falling. I watched a loaf of bread fall off of a counter in my kitchen from a perfectly secure position away from the edge. The countertop is level, and the windows weren't open, so I was truly unable to locate the source of what made this thing fall. Similarly, a few days later, I placed an empty square container on my kitchen table away from the edge. I turned around for a few seconds when I suddenly heard it hit the floor. I turned back around, and sure enough it was on the floor. I checked if the windows were open, and again none were.

 That weekend, I went into work for a few hours and saw a binder fall off of a table with no force that I could identify. These are just a few of these instances. It was like someone was trying to get my attention.

At work, we have a break room, and there's a piece of metal on the floor in the doorway that makes a specific noise every time you step on it. My coworker was already in the breakroom when I got there, and we were the only two in that day. I stepped on the metal, and it made the noise. As I was unpacking my bag, I heard the noise again even though no one had stepped on the metal. 

I turned to my coworker, who has been there longer than me and seen a lot of strange things at our workplace.

Me: Did you hear that?

Coworker: Yeah.

Me: Has that ever happened without someone stepping on it?

Coworker: No. 

Then we started our day at work, and we have four doors that lead into this particular room from other parts of the building. At three different times, these three doors opened and closed without anyone being there. They didn't open all the way but widely enough for us to see that there was no one there. The two doors that open to the outside weren't open so it couldn't have been wind, plus the doors are pretty heavy so the chances of wind blowing them open anyway are slim. 

Me **after the third time**: What the hell?

Coworker: I don't know. 

Me **after telling him about the things falling**: Am I going crazy?

Coworker: We might be going crazy in sync.

Honestly, I wouldn't be too surprised if we were going crazy simultaneously because we've been through a lot together. But these are clear physical phenomena that we probably wouldn't both conjure up at the same time. 

A few weeks went by, and all of these things stopped until there were new incidents. Two days in a row my family and I heard noises in my house we couldn't find the source of. The first was a whooshing noise in the next room over from where we were sitting. The second was a popping noise in another room. The problem with both of these was not only could we not find the sources, but everything in both rooms was exactly the same as before we heard the noises. We thoroughly inspected both rooms both times for a solid fifteen minutes.

Lastly, I began feeling a draft coming from my right in my bedroom. I checked the window to my right because when that window is open and I'm sitting in that particular spot where I was, I can definitely feel wind when the window is open. It wasn't open which wasn't surprising because it's winter, and I didn't remember opening the window. I don't recall ever feeling any kind of significant draft from that window before when it was closed. Obviously, some cold air is always going to come through, but this was significantly more than that. 

I thought I was only experiencing this in my bedroom until I felt the same thing in my living room. This time not only were all the windows closed, but my right side wasn't even facing a window. 

I then considered the timing of all of this and have developed a hypothesis of sorts. About a month ago when this all started, my mom and I had gone through her mom's belongings. Her mom died nine or ten years ago. We went through her jewelry, and my mom told me I could keep some things if I wanted, and she would take some and the rest would go to other relatives. I took this pair of earrings that my grandma wore almost every day. They're probably the thing I remember most vividly about her. I now wear them almost as often. 

I'm not sure why my grandma would be following me around, but it's the best guess I have right now. Everything started right after I got the earrings, and I've never really experienced anything like this before. The draft always being on my right side in and of itself might be a sign. For whatever reason, in all of my prominent memories of my grandma, she was sitting on my right. 

Anyone have any thoughts as to whether I'm being followed or going crazy?"
"The ""polterguest""","Texas","Haunted Places","When I was in fourth grade I went off to a Christian summer camp for the summer and when I came home, I discovered that we had moved. Our new house was much larger than the house that I left behind when I went to camp. It was a two-story brick house with a modern-styled interior. The house was built sometime in the late 1800s to the early 1900s however the specific date is lost to history. It was remodeled in 2004 and sold in 2016, and we finalized the purchase in the summer of 2017. 

My bedroom was the old master from before the remodel, making it a very spacious room. It is right above the current master and has the biggest closet in the house. I shared with my sister for a while, before she moved rooms. At the back of the house, directly down the hallway from my room, is a guest bedroom with two small closets and a small attic door that is about the height of my foot to my knee. I am around 5'6, if that gives you any reference. Point is, it was small and I was in fourth grade so it became my new ""house"". I was playing in here one day when I discovered that there were children's drawings along the top border of the wall. Immediately after seeing the drawings, I felt extremely creeped out. 

I am not one to get creeped out easily. I fall asleep to American Horror Story and my favorite books are The Shining and Coraline, so this was an extremely weird feeling. I ran out of the room and downstairs with my family. For years, I refused to go into that room by myself because it gave me bad vibes. 

One night, I was having a sleepover with my friends. I am not using their real names, so let's call them Amelia and Kyla. Kyla was an athletic basketball player who wasn't scared of anything and Amelia was the fearless comedic relief of the group. I was sleeping on a twin bed at the time and I couldn't fit all three of us, so we decided to sleep in the guest bedroom which had a king. Immediately after laying down and turning off the lights, something fell in the closet. I was already starting to get bad vibes again and Kyla asked if anyone felt cold. I then noticed that it was freezing cold in this room that was normally pretty hot. Amelia said that something didn't feel right and we all ran back to my room and slept on the floor. 

After that, doors would slam and things would fall but nothing as extreme. One time both of my dogs got stuck in there and were whining and yelping as if both were hurt. The door was locked from the inside, which was impossible, and they were hiding when we found them. 

I am still living in that house and I am almost a freshman in high school and I am still terrified of that room. We have since dubbed the ghost ""Polterguest"" My sister sleeps in there and says she has weird dreams, but that's it. We've had it cleansed and prayed over several times, but nothing works. Someone told me to cuss out the spirit and ask it to leave, so I am going to try that. 

Is it the wandering ghost of a child or something more sinister? Did those drawings have anything to do with it?"
"""imaginary"" Friend","Ohio","Haunted Places","I am a lover of all things paranormal. It has interested me my whole life. However, I have not had many first-hand experiences or encounters with the paranormal... Besides one. 

I was young, maybe about 5 years old at the most. I lived in a two-story apartment in Dayton, Ohio with my mother and father at the time, before my sister was born. I am going on 26 years old now, there isn't much of my childhood that I can clearly remember. It seems over the years every thing becomes more and more fuzzy like I am trying to tune the static out of an old T.V. But I will always remember this about living in this apartment; I had an imaginary friend. 

I remember having an imaginary friend. Very distinctly. My imaginary friend was a boy. He didn't have a name that I can recall. I remember locking myself in my room for hours and playing. Jumping on the bed, playing with dolls. Talking to him. But that is the extent of what I can remember about him. 

It wouldn't be until years later after we moved from that apartment and I was older, that my parents would share a story with me that haunts me to this day.

They knew I had an imaginary friend. That was all I did day in and day out. I developed this imaginary friend after we had moved into this apartment. According to my parents, I started doing bad things. Things that I normally did not do prior to having this imaginary friend. I would have accidents on myself and pee on the floor in my room like a dog. I would lock my cats in the trunk that sat outside of my door in the hallway. My attitude and the way I talked to my mother seemed to get worse too. When confronted about my actions and the things that I was doing, they said I would blame it on my cousin Amber (who had never even been over before). 

My mother in particular has always told me that she hated my room in that apartment. She hated to be in my room by herself, as she would always feel as if something was watching her. 

There was one day in particular, where things got really strange.

My father was working a third shift job at the time. He had worked some over-time that day and came home and wanted to go to sleep. He walked up the stairs, past my room where my door was shut, and into his room across the hall. My parent's story about what happened has never faltered or changed as many times as I have heard it. 

My dad could hear me in my room playing with what seemed to be another kid. He heard two voices. I suppose I could have easily been replying to myself in different tones to give my imaginary friend a voice, except he claims there were times our voices over-lapped and he could clearly tell he was hearing two different children. Laughing, playing, being kids. 

He called for my mother to come to their room so that he could tell her to go tell me and ""that neighbor boy"" to keep it down so he could sleep. My mother insisted that she did not hear anyone else with me, and that there was no other kids in the room except me. Sure enough when they checked, I was alone. 

Not sure when we ended up moving from that apartment, but we did. My parents claimed like flipping a switch, as soon as we moved out, I no longer had an imaginary friend. I can not sit here and tell you that yes, it was ghost! Because, well, I just don't know. I for sure know, and remember, the imaginary friend. I can't ever re-call that anything weird ever happened to me during this time, like hearing him, or seeing him. I only remember the act of acting like there was someone with me to play with, and speaking at this thing that I could not see. But to my parents, there was definitely something more than just a child playing make-believe.

To top it all off, a few years later, a friend of my dad's moved into the same apartment with his daughter and son. They knew nothing of the experience we had in the home. Imagine how my parents felt to learn that this friend's daughter took my old room, and a few weeks upon moving in, she had her very own, imaginary friend. She continued to have an imaginary friend until the day that they too, moved from the home.

This story is one of my most prized-possessions. When the topic of ghosts is on the table, it is the one I whip out. It is eerie, and some-what unsettling. But it one-hundred percent, true.

This apartment is relatively close to where my grandparents currently live and have lived for many, many years. Over all these years there has been a handful of occasions where we have drove, or walked, past it. I find that every single time, I find myself looking up into the window of what used to be my old room, wondering if he might be looking back at me and remember me."
"Dad Will Not Vacate His House","New Mexico","Haunted Places","My Dad passed away in September 2017 after getting out of bed late at night. He fell down and hit his head on walk-in closet door frame and didn't regain consciousness even after he was taken to the hospital. I believe that his spirit was thrown from his body at that point. He had no spiritual beliefs and didn't seem to believe in any kind of afterlife. He was very attached to his home that he had built himself and lived in for about 28 years. His health had deteriorated as he got older, and he was frequently not very happy and in a lot of pain. So, he had basically passed away very unexpectedly and without warning or preparation.

 At his funeral I got up and read some Holy Bible verses. It was very quiet in the room or chapel and as I was reading there was a very loud popping like sound in the walls or ceiling. I pretty much knew right then that his spirit or ghost was there watching. Afterwards, when I would go and visit or stay in his house, I would often sense his presence and hear popping, clicking or thumping noises in the house, particularly late at night when it was quiet. It was a little disturbing to say the least, and it took some time to figure out that he had become a ghost or earthbound spirit.

 In the month of March 2021 after installing some home security video cameras, I started hearing those sounds again and seeing white shapes or very fast- moving orbs at night when it was dark inside the house. Sometimes, it had like a face on the front or tip of the fast-moving orbs or shapes. I have figured out that he is still residing in his house and have captured many videos of him moving about in different parts or rooms in the house. In other words, it has become a haunted house.

 I have tried to communicate or talk to his ghost or spirit in order to try and get him to move on or leave the house. Because some other members of my family want to sell the house soon. But I think it might not be such a good idea to sell it as long as his ghost or spirit is still residing there. Unless of course, any prospective new owners are made aware of it being a haunted house.

 So, after trying numerous rituals or methods to get him to move on or leave this house, he still remains or is perhaps, stuck or trapped in some way. He was a very stubborn person and has become so it seems a very stubborn ghost or spirit. I will keep trying to get the ghost out of there, but it does seem to be somewhat difficult to get him to vacate or leave his house."
"Paranormal Encounters In Gettysburg Part 2","Pennsylvania","Haunted Places","During our second night in Gettysburg, I met with my brother and sister and together we strolled through the fields to occupy some time before another tour. Our second tour lasted for about three hours, in which we were informed of a few encounters past tourists claimed they allegedly experienced. One included a cocky tourist who spent a night at the renowned Farnsworth House and was confronted by the spirits of two Confederate soldiers he at first mistook for reenactors playing a practical joke. 

We met another tourist visiting from Niagara Falls, New York and we began conversing about cultural differences as well as debunking amusing Canadian stereotypes. Particularly the excessive use of the expression ""eh"" and the mispronunciation of about (aboot). The tourist began taking pictures as we wandered around the fields. The shots on her digital camera depicted the image of what appeared to be four distorted orbs arranged in sort of a diamond shape. 

Of course, being incredibly superstitious at the time, I immediately interpreted these images as the result of paranormal activity. Residual energy from spirits of those long since departed. The sight of orbs is reportedly a common occurrence among paranormal enthusiasts who explore such historic landmarks. To this day, I still feel an outstanding sense of awe when reminiscing about these events. 

Are these orbs truly the leftover energy from the tens of thousands of unfortunate souls, who even to this day, have yet to find peace? Or are they completely natural occurrences which can be explained using logic and rational thought?"
"Kentucky Dream Turned To Nightmare","Kentucky","Haunted Places","So upon many just awful life circumstances in a particular region of the United States, I decided to take my two children and move to a more rural and desirable location for all of us to live in. When I told my children that we would be moving to Kentucky, and showed them photos online of the deer, snow, large fields, farms, etc... They were so excited! I could barely contain my excitement as well, just seeing how happy it made them. 

A couple months had passed and we were moved into our new apartment in Kentucky. Taking walks on the trails in the evenings after school and work, enjoying seeing wild deer run along our apartment complex, and even snow, just as we had waited for. We had spent all of 30 days in our new apartment when the Governor of Kentucky shutdown all public brick and mortar schools for COVID and switched to online learning, which meant I was now out of work. 

Although I was feeling defeated, like I had just made this huge change for my family and it was beginning to crumble already, I kept my spirits up and we went about our days as normal as we could. I stuck with our morning routine, and same evening routine, but throughout the day we were home now, and I began to notice small things that I dismissed as my kids not being honest with me.

One afternoon after completing lunch and finishing the dishes, I stepped out of the kitchen to serve my children lunch in the living room where they were doing schoolwork. I then went to use the restroom about 10 footsteps away from my kids location in the living room. When I reemerged from the restroom, the children were in the same location in the living room and I walked straight to the kitchen to pour a glass of tea. I found all the plates in the dish drainer, turned in the opposite direction as I had just put them in. 

I stopped in my tracks. I asked my children what they came into the kitchen for, and followed that up by saying I would get them something in the kitchen because they need to be focused on their studies. They both were very serious and said they hadn't gone into the Kitchen. I completely dismissed them, and said please don't do it again, they professed they had not been in the kitchen. I had almost begun to scold them for lying, but I refrained, and said, ""ok, listen, let's just get back to our work, which problem are you on right now? Can I help you if you need help?"" So the rest of the day went as planned. 

Another time I noticed my screens in the back windows had been pushed out of the window. I went out back to put them in. I also asked my children who had opened the windows to do such a thing, they said they hadn't. I sat them both down, and I brought in one of the screens and said, ""Do you see this? This is the indent from the inside of the screen being pushed outward, I KNOW one of you pushed them out."" They both repeatedly denied it. Neither tried to blame it on the other which is their usual fashion if they are guilty, so I should have suspected something else being wrong.

Then, just over 35 days of living in the apartment, we settled down for sleep that night and we all fell asleep very well. My children woke up in the middle of the night and asked if they could sleep with me, so I said, let's all go sleep in the living room, so I can watch some TV to get back to sleep. We lay on the two couches. Myself and my daughter on one couch, my son on the couch angled facing ours, and watching TV we all began to fall back asleep. As I began to drift off, I turned off the TV and rolled over. I do recall rolling over several times more in the middle of the night and going back to sleep, before I suddenly, and for no reason (like, I did not hear a noise or anything) I awoke, and not groggy, but I awoke and felt fully rested, which was odd for me to feel in the middle of the night. I sat up, the room had light from outside filtering in through the blinds, and as I looked at my surroundings, I could see my Son on the couch moving to the left of the couch. I could see him moving, but not his arms or legs moving. So I squinted my eyes and moved my head an inch or so closer to his direction and I looked more closely. It wasn't him moving, but rather him being picked up by his armpits, by nothing that had any shape or form, as he lay on his back, and being dragged toward the left of the couch. I swore that my eyes must be seeing this wrong, I rubbed them right away, and as I finished rubbing them, I waited even a brief moment before opening them again expecting NOT to see what I had just seen, but in fact, just then, the nothingness that had hold of his armpits, dropped him and his body fell about 6 inches back onto the couch, which I saw with my eyes. 

I then jumped up quickly and ran for the lights, and I turned them on, then, I turned all of them in the entire apartment on, and my children awoke. I was scared, but I could not tell them why as I didn't want to frighten them, so I told them we were waking early today to get a head start on the day. An hour or so passed by before it even turned 5am and both my children were questioning why so early, so I said I would take them for a nice morning walk when the Sun rose, which we did. This day would be the last day we spent in the apartment, but did not know it at the time.

The afternoon went well, nothing funny in the kitchen, nothing else noticed that day, although I did feel several times that day distracted by what I thought I saw first thing when I woke up. I would then focus on my days tasks again, and try not to think about it. Soon, it was evening routine after dinner, bath time, teeth time, and then bedtime. Don't ask me why, but I felt we would be closer to the front door to run out of if we slept in the living room again, so we laid down on both of the couches again. Except this time, I moved the couch my Son was sleeping on closer to ours. I wanted us to all be close to one another and sleep with the TV on all night. My Daughter and I were watching TV as I noticed my Son had fallen asleep. After another episode had played on TV I looked over at my Daughter and she was still awake, 30 minutes had passed since my Son had fallen asleep and I asked my daughter to close her eyes. She said she wasn't tired.

 I was soon glad she asked for one more episode, because right after I agreed and it started to air, my Son started shaking all over... Not like a chill sort of shake, but a violent shake, arms and legs. My daughter and I sat straight up on the couch and watched for a brief moment, when as a Mom, I felt paralyzed for a moment as to what to do. I slowly got off the couch and stepped toward him still his arms and legs flailing and now his head was also starting and I reached my hand to him and right as I touched him he not only stopped shaking but his eyes opened right away to look at me and he spoke and said ""Hi, Mom"" I stood back, because I could see his eyes were as if he had been asleep. My daughter sat on the couch and screamed ""Are you ok?"" I asked the same, and I told him he had just been shaking, he said ""I'm ok, I'm Ok"" and rolled over to go back to sleep. I pulled his covers up that had shaken off of him, and he rolled over.

No sooner than I lie back down with my daughter on the couch, JUST the blanket, not my Son, began to shake violently. My Son was lying completely still this time... Again, we sat straight up, I yelled to my daughter in freight, ""DO YOU SEE THAT?"" she answered ""OH MY GOD MOMMY WHAT IS HAPPENING?"" I once again, took the step toward my Son and reached out my arm and just before I was to touch the blanket with my hand, the blanket shot directly up into the air, as if pulled up by a corner of the blanket and lifted, but nothing was in the room that could be seen. I was terrified, my daughter was screaming and screaming. My son however was fast asleep, until I touched him directly, and that is when without hesitation he jumped to his knees and hopped over to our couch and I again turned all the lights on.

A few more terrifying occurrences that night as we were packing, however nothing more terrifying as that. We packed our bags, which were some clothing, and went to a motel, and have never been back. All the rest of our belongings were left there, I wanted nothing to do with anything from that place, in fact, if I ever see anything resembling anything I left there, I might shrivel in terror. We had such wonderful plans for our move to Kentucky, but it seems that something did not share in our enthusiasm. We have never looked back and have never seen anything like that before nor afterwards, thanks be to GOD!"
"Paranormal Encounters In Gettysburg","Pennsylvania","Haunted Places","In August of 2007, I traveled to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania with my mother, brother and sister for a weekend in order to visit the renowned historic sites and learn more about the town's many supernatural occurrences. We attended a series of tours to learn more about the town's outstanding history and see if we could potentially catch a glimpse of one of its spectral residents. 

We toured the interior of the Jenny Wade House, observing the many holes in the doors and one of the bed frames left behind from the many bullets fired from snipers during the horrific battle in 1863. As we looked around, gazing at the many historic artifacts, mostly books and furniture, I, along with some of the other guests, became bewildered, as we noticed drawer doors opening on their own and a rocking chair in the corner slowly moving back and forth, despite it being unoccupied. Or so it appeared. 

Our first tour continued up until eleven that night. We stood together in a vast group while our tour guide was in the middle of describing the events leading to the battle. Our attention was briefly diverted to a stretch of forest area in the distance. We could clearly hear the sound of rifles firing in unison. 

Though it would be easy to dismiss the occurrence as either a reenactment, or perhaps fireworks, the proximity of the noise was close enough for us to notice that no reenactments were taking place. We found ourselves alone in the fields and were also completely aware of the absence of smoke or the sulfurous odor the antique rifles leave behind. In addition, there were no signs of fireworks, especially since we were close to a forest, which would have been set ablaze if any fireworks were set off. Incidents such as these are reportedly very common among other enthusiastic visitors."
"Observed On A Crosswalk","Connecticut","Orbs / Lights / Mists","It's been some time since I had an experience to relate, and this one will require a little context.

My wife and I work together in the English department at our school. Since we bought our house five years ago, we have saved money by doing without a second car and sharing one nice, affordable vehicle. Because I can become impatient when I'm driving, my wife tends to drive when we are travelling together; I'm adult enough to concede that she is the safer driver. 

Driving home at the end of the school day, when we cross the border into our hometown there are two different routes we can take to get to our house. The left-hand route appears to be shorter on the map; in fact it is slower because it is congested with rush-hour traffic and four traffic lights in close proximity. The right-hand route veers away from the right direction, but loops back around quite close to our house and there is far less traffic on that road. My wife favors taking the right-hand road almost every night. 

On Thursday night (December second), just about sunset, we were taking the customary right-hand route. After we cross a bridge, there is a crosswalk for pedestrians about 30 feet away. Though there were no pedestrians on the crosswalk, nor any approaching it, my wife slowed down to almost a complete stop. I looked out of the windshield to see a roughly pyramid or cone-shaped mist, about two-and-a-half to three feet in height, standing/hovering on the crosswalk about a foot away from the curb. The mist was a pale, translucent grey that lingered for 5 or 6 seconds as we watched it slowly evaporate. It did not appear to be moving in any direction, it was visible both in our headlights and the headlights of the vehicle behind us, and it did not have a shadow that I could see. The grey mist did not ascend like smoke, nor did it roll away like fog; it became more and more pale until it was invisible. Once it had disappeared, my wife accelerated away from the location at a reasonable speed. 

I asked her, ""did you see that, too?""

She responded, ""what, the grey thing?"" When I described it as I have in the above paragraph, she added, ""I couldn't have given you that much detail, but yeah. What was it?""

My reaction was that it was one of two possibilities: first, some sort of optical illusion, though how it was created, how it was maintained, and what made it disappear were in no way consistent with the environment in which we saw it; or, second, that it was some sort of paranormal entity or object. She stated, ""well, I'm not in any way psychic, so I think it was an illusion. I've never seen a ghost.""

I pointed out that the fact that most people haven't seen one is the reason that seeing one frightens them. I did not mention to her that my ""supernatural sense"" was active while I was observing the object, as I did not wish to alarm her; also, it wasn't a full-blown atmospheric vibe that I normally experience, more of a dull tingle that something was ""off"" about the whole situation.

Has anyone else here on YGS seen something like this? The last narrative I posted about supernatural objects (""Metallic Manifestations"") that I saw described items that appeared to be solid objects; witnessing a translucent, almost transparent, object is a new experience for me. The fact that my wife saw it, too, is highly unusual. I'd appreciate any feedback from the forum on this, and I'll try to respond in a timely manner to any questions you might have.

Best,

"Experimenting With A Home Made Ouija Board As Child","Virginia","Ouija Board / Seances","About 10 years ago, I experimented with a home made Ouija board with my friends. This was the start of my paranormal activity fascination. (I'll tell you that I don't remember much of this story but thank god this was the time I actually wrote down my experiences, besides school experiences).

In the summer of 2011 (July 19 I think, all the notebook said was July). 

My friend Maddie invited me and my other friend Faith over for a sleepover. It was late at night somewhere around 9:30pm. We were all bored.

We had watched about half of the movies Maddie owned (which was a lot) and it was only after 9pm. We had started watching movies at around 5pm so it was about 4 movies we had watched that night. 

After a while of chatting and eating snacks Maddie's parents brought us earlier, the topic of ghosts came up. I was interested in paranormal activity at the time (I still am) along with Maddie, who found it fascinating as well. Not much of a surprise that sneaked in the conversation.

Faith was a different story.

She actually had phasmophobia (fear of ghosts). Me and Maddie never got bothered by this and sometimes would try to help her overcome her fear.

Anyway as we were talking about ghosts and stuff. Maddie suggested that we should play the Ouija board. Since I was an dumb and careless child I agreed with her.

The only problem here was that Maddie didn't own a Ouija board and didn't know anyone else who would have an Ouija board. Faith sitting on Maddie's bed said we could make one. I could tell she wanted in on the action too.

We agreed with Faith and went straight to work. Maddie didn't have any good supplies we could use so we had to make it out of construction paper. Faith helped and did all the drawing since she was good at it, I was searching up the rules, and Maddie was making the planchette.

After everything was set up it was around 10 maybe 11pm. So it was dark out. Kind of a perfect time to play.

So we set the board in between us (Me and Faith were up against Maddie's bed and Maddie was by her dresser).

I learned that if you do it in figure eights that'll get the energy going. I tried it out by doing this moment 5 times with all of our fingers on the planchette. After the 5 time I asked if there's someone who would like to talk to us? The planchette moved over to yes. 

Me and the girls all looked at each other. We're now communicating a sprit? The energy in the room felt no different though. We just went a head asking questions, Faith staying close by be because she was freaked out.

Maddie: ""Are you a good sprit?""

Answer: ""YES""

Faith: ""what's your name?""

Answer: ""Sadie""

Me: ""Sadie how old are you?""

Sadie: ""7""

Maddie: ""I don't mean to be mean but when did you die?""

Sadie: ""1998""

Faith: ""Where are you in the room?""

Sadie: ""She has Blonde hair""

Maddie: ""you mean me?""

Sadie: ""YES""

We all looked at each other then Maddie said she felt a strong peaceful like energy right on her left. I just went a head and asked a question.

Me: ""Sadie, do you mind knocking some thing over for us?""

Sadie: ""YES""

A couple minutes later we saw one of Maddie's stuff animals fall off the shelf. Then there was laughter of a little girl. Seconds later the planchette moved again:

Sadie:"" that was funny but I must leave ""

Faith: ""I wish you could talk more""

All three of us said goodbye and then I moved the planchette to goodbye.

It was a really interesting night for us and I'll never forget about it.

Till this day Maddie hasn't experienced anything odd in her house which made us sad because the girl was so nice.

If you have questions don't mind asking! Bye."
"The Red Crayon Followed Me?","Virginia","Haunted Places","Alright hear me out. Everyone here is probably going to think this is fiction. But I want to share this with all the YGS readers. So I'll just start at the beginning. (This was a period of 5 days) 

November 22, 2021

At around 12 pm my mom and Alexa left the house to get stuff for Thanksgiving. We were inviting most of my mom's family over like we always do every year. So my mother wanted to get lots of food for the about 20 people, plus us she was inviting. So when she had came home it took about 15 minutes to get all of the grocery bags on the table.

Now in the time she was gone which was maybe 1 hour and 30 minutes. One event happen that involved my younger sister, Sophie.

Sophie is about 14 years old almost 15. So she's a lot younger than me and Alexa.

 (If you spent a day with her not knowing her age you'd think she was 10 or something) 

Now for this story to make sense. I was in the living room that had the door to the backyard, if you were standing in the kitchen you'd be able to see the living room I was in perfectly. Now the steps to upstairs were right by the front door so when you'd walk in on your right would be the steps, in front of you would be a bathroom on the left and the entrance to the living room, and on the left would be the second living room. 

As I was just sitting in the living room I noticed a red crayon rolling on the ground and right to my foot. As it stopped rolling I heard a girl yell for me from upstairs possibly around 10 years. I thought it was Sophia even though she said she was going outside. But maybe she snuck in the house without me knowing. Besides she was the only other girl in this house so it made sense at the time for the voice to belong to her. So I just got up and headed to the stairs. As I reached the first step I froze, the same red crayon was there just laying on the first stair. I ran back to the living room where I found the red crayon rolling to my foot. It was gone. I ran back to the stairs and the crayon had moved to the second step. I heard the same voice call for me from upstairs. Just then the back door opened, and Sophia walked in. This is what we said:

Sophia: ""umm what's wrong?""

Me: ""Are you playing a trick on me with this red crayon?""

Sophia: ""No, I wasn't even in the house this entire time.""

I froze to clear my self up. Obviously something in this house is playing a trick on me. But I didn't know what it was was.

That night I had a dream that I was looking at the crayon and out of nowhere it moved to the next step twice. This happened every night until this night it made it's way up all the stairs. All of a sudden things went dark and I heard a girl the same voice that had been calling my name say:

""I'm coming for you, so you better watch out""

I swear I could've seen the smallest outline of a girl just sitting there on the top step.

Ever since this happened I've been doing loads of research. But I could barely find anything to help my experience. Although I happened to come across some urban legends and creepy pastas but nothing about a little girl, considerably a ghost.

Now I'm obviously not going to a conclusion yet. I want to find more information on this before I even insist to jump to conclusions. Most likely looking up the history of the house.

I'll keep you guys posted if I can. Bye, hope you enjoyed this odd story."
"Spirits Are Very Real","California","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","My name is Randall, 

 It was the spring or early summer of 1973. I was fifteen years old at the time, living in the coastal town of Pacifica in central California, with my three siblings, my father and his new Hawaiian girlfriend that also had several children. The three youngest lived with us.

I'd just gotten home from school, and was anxious to sit down and read a book that I'd gotten from the school library. Not that I'm a big reader. It was just one of very few books that actually ever caught my attention. Since no one else was home at the time, I sat down at the kitchen table and started reading. I quickly got so into the storyline of the book that I was soon visualizing the scenes and characters, and seemed to even become consciously unaware of the words on the pages.

Then without warning, a young Indian woman stepped into the doorway of the kitchen, in my peripheral vision. She was dressed in an all-leather buckskin outfit with leather tassels. I could clearly see her long braided dark hair, which had thin strips of leather tied at the ends of the braids. I could also see she was wearing some turquoise jewelry. 

The event didn't startle me nor scare me. Though it was something that I never expected to actually happen. You see, up to that point in time, I'd had several very brief encounters. So brief and illusive that I questioned that maybe, my mind may have actually just been playing tricks on me. Also, when we'd first moved into the town of Pacifica, some of our neighbors told us that our neighborhood had been built over an Indian burial ground. 

The neighbor woman from across the street even stated that she'd walked into the bedroom to check on her infant and saw an Indian woman standing at the crib looking at her child. At the time, I totally thought those stories had most likely been provoked by people's fears about the burial ground. Yet, here I was having a similar event, at a moment when I hadn't even given the subject a single thought, and was preoccupied with a book that I'd been reading.

I hesitated to look right away, because I'd learned from previous events that when you just look, nothing is ever there. It's as if engaging your physical senses blocks the receptibility of your soul, which is what I think is seeing the image and not your eyes. Anyhow, even when you don't look quickly and try not to activate your physical senses and brain, the event is still quite brief and illusive.

I couldn't help but ponder the whole event and its detail, questioning why it might have happened, and especially to me. I questioned, that if it was a ghost of someone that has passed, then why could I see its body? And more than that, why was I able to see her clothes and jewelry, since they're inanimate objects. With that, I drew what I considered to be a more rational conclusion. That most likely there was a spirit there with me, simply trying to get my attention and wanting to gage my reaction or receptibility. I believed it chose the image of a person, knowing that I was there alone, thus, knowing it would be a bit more alerting to my consciousness. And chose an Indian woman to get me to think ghost, thus also knowing that I'd then think spirit, especially after seeing the inanimate objects. 

 About a week later, I had a test to do at school. One that I was very concerned about doing well on. The day of the test. I arrived on the school grounds just a few minutes late. I was walking briskly with books under one arm when the bell rang for everyone to go inside. My classroom was the one at the far-left end of the building. As I was walking briskly that direction, a ball came rolling out towards me, as if someone had kicked it. I didn't want to take the time to get it, but just knew that one of the yard-duty teachers was most likely going to ask me to get it. Knowing that I wanted every minute possibly to do my test, I avoided looking or going towards that ball. But to my surprise the darn ball kept rolling at an angle towards me. And ended up rolling right up to me, to the point that I shifted my books from my right arm to my left, bent over and started to put my hands around it to pick it up. As I then put my eyes directly on it, it vanished. I quickly stood back up, looked around to see if anyone had just witnessed that embarrassing event. 

I then walked to class to do my test. I quickly realized that the spirit that I'd pondered, just a few days earlier, might have had the ability to project images of people and inanimate objects at me, just proved it boldly by projecting only an inanimate object at me that was so real that I tried to pick it up. That told me that both events were in fact very real, and that that spirit was in fact reaching out to me for some unknown reason. A reason that I'd learn much more about years later."
"The Bingham Light On Halloween Night","South Carolina","Orbs / Lights / Mists","I haven't posted on this site in a long time, mainly because I haven't had any recent experiences aside from maybe one earlier this year or last year I think.

However, that changed just this past Halloween so I just wanted to give an update on another experience with the Bingham light! (Read my previous stories for back information.) 

I went out to the community of Bingham to attempt to see the light this past Halloween. It was obviously the perfect time to go. 

I was expecting to see a crowd of people out there given the occasion, but to my surprise I only saw 1 or 2 other cars and they were only driving through the location and then left. By time I had gotten down the mile long dirt road (S. Butler road) I was the only one out there.

Nothing spectacular happened that night. I just got out of the car and did the usual call, ""Bingham Light, come out!"". As always, it was pretty creepy out there but I had been out there so many times that I became quite accustomed to it by now. I think the scariest part about being out there is the darkness itself along with the remoteness of the area. The light in and of itself is nothing scary. It's just knowing what it is that gets to you!

The crops in the field was grown up to maybe a foot and I noticed there were 2 cotton trucks parked on opposite sides of the field.

I stood out there maybe 20 something minutes (estimate) calling the light and looking around me at all times. I asked it to reveal itself in a way that wouldn't scare me.

It wasn't much long after that when I noticed right dead in the middle of the field I saw a faint flash low to the ground. It took a second for my eyes to really adjust to what I was looking at, but given my previous experiences I quickly realized that was the light! It was moving towards me at a fairly quick pace in it's usual side to side motion. Within seconds it was only a few yards away from me. I quickly ran to my car and tore out of there!

The thing about this light is that it's so faint that you really don't realize what you're seeing until it's nearly right up on you. That's the scary part about it. A lot of people (and I do mean A LOT) have exaggerated the appearance of the light over the years, but on the handful of occasions I've seen the light it showed itself as a soft faint blue-ish illumination that flashed side to side. Never anything like hard and bright light - like car lights or a flame. It's not even as bright as a firefly illumination and there ARE tons of those out there in the warm months, so that alone has unknowingly confused many I'm sure! But I digress at this point...

Anyway, I left S. Butler road and took a left onto Hwy 34 to drive another mile or so around to Reedy Springs Ct - which is another dirt road. The whole area is connected, so Reedy Springs Ct runs parallel to S. Butler road (imagine something along the lines of a big rectangle and you sorta got the picture).

I got down Reedy Springs Ct, turned my car around and parked at the point where the two dirt roads intersect. At first I got out of the car and made the call but it began to dawn on me just how creepy that area was. I thought the area around the crop field on S. Butler road was creepy, but Reedy Springs Ct is just outright dreadful on a dark night!

I couldn't stand out there any longer. I quickly got back in my car and rolled the passenger window down and made the call to the light. I made sure to look around me at all times as that particular area is where the light is known to come up on you close and FAST... Though it never happened to me yet.

After several minutes I didn't see anything and I wasn't about to wait around much longer either. I was getting creeped out by the minute so I had to go!

Although not much happened that night, I can say that I did finally get to see the light again after so long. After all, considering I had over 50 something visits, I've only seen the light maybe 5-6 times in the span of 10 years.

I'm glad to know that the ghost light of Bingham still exists!"
"Thing That Follows Me","California","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","Recently on November 1st 2021 at about 6am I woke up from a nightmare. I usually only have nightmares and I know that the thing that haunts me is around when I get woken up from a nightmare. Usually I feel like I am being strangled or my bed shakes. But this time I woke up in a cold sweat and saw this thing standing in the room. I had never seen it outside of my own home and during this time I was at my mom's, watching the house while she was out of town. 

When I woke up it was standing there no sound and it didn't move at all. It was black, tall, slender as if it were stretched, and it didn't have an ""outline"". What I mean is it looked like it was dissipating one the edges of its body but not like it was actually dissipating. Almost as if the dark part of it slowly turned to fog or smoke. 

I didn't know what to do so I stared at it for about 5 minutes. I knew it was at least that long because of the security hub on the ceiling. Every 30-45 seconds the hub has a blue ring that turns on faintly that illuminates a small area. The thing was right underneath it and would not get illuminated at all. 

The dog never woke up and no one else was in the house. The scariest part is it was in full view. I had seen it before from time to time but only out of the corner of my eye or just a piece of it. Before this the most notable time was when I shined a flashlight in my room and when I pointed it at the ceiling corner it stayed pitch black. Now it is bold enough to stand there 6 feet from me. 

I don't know what it is and I don't know how to get it to leave. I used sage in the room afterwards and then on myself. If anyone has any idea what this thing is I would love to know and if anyone has had a similar experience I would also love to know. Whatever this thing is it has been around me a long long time. 

Also I asked my mom if she had ever seen anything like it and she said no. She is a very spiritual person and believes me but she has never experienced what I had."
"A Collection Of Experiences From My School","Virginia","Haunted Places","So basically back when I was around 8 I had lots of paranormal experiences at my Elementary school, which started my fascination with the paranormal activity. I forgot the name of the school because that was back when I was living in Ohio and I have moved to Virginia about 3 weeks ago. So technically these are things I've noticed at my school that I kept a notebook of so I hope you enjoy. (Back then I named this experiences so yeah). 

Footsteps in the bathroom

On October 5, 2017 I was going to the restroom. There was multiple girls bathrooms in the school but I went to the one I found the creepiest. It was the creepiest because that's were most of the experiences happened. So I went into the stall and after a minute or two I heard footsteps. I thought that it was just someone else. Till I realized if it was someone else, you I would have heard the door swing open and noise from the halls and classrooms. Although I never did. When I got out of the stall I turned to the door and realized it was open. When I mean open, it was just standing open not moving anywhere. The door I'm talking about are the ones that don't stay open they'll just close and you'd have to hold it for it to stay open. But no one was there, although yet again I thought someone was holding it from the outside of the bathroom and I just can't see them behind the door. For this very reason I said hello but no one answered and the door closed, I ran over to the door as quick as I could and pushed it open. No one was there, there's no possible way to hide in a second. I don't know what I experienced but I know it wasn't normal.

Laughing in the gym

On December 13, 2017 it was after school. I was doing a play tryout for my school, it was around 5pm so things got dark real quickly. Me and my friend were talking and practicing lines when we both noticed a child's laughter, possibly belonged to a little girl around 5 years maybe. We looked over at everyone else who looked confused. We heard the child laugh again, now we knew it wasn't anyone here. I heard a few 6 graders talking quietly to one another and pointing to the stage, I noticed the curtains on the stage oddly moving. Some 6 graders went over to the stage, I followed because I wanted in on the action. Someone moved the curtain a little to see if it was someone playing a trick on us. The child's laughter started again and I could almost see an outline of the little girl. We walked away from the stage quite confused on what we saw.

A lady's scream

On March 3 2017 I was alone walking to the office with a note from my teacher that she had asked me to give to the office. This will be short and weird but for reasons I'll explain that in this school we have a basement that is right across from the office. Now basically as I was walking to the office, I noticed the scream of a woman coming from the basement. The scream was dreadful and when I went to sleep that night I heard a woman scream from outside my window."
"Did A Ghost Follow Me Home!?","Virginia","Misc","Two weeks ago I and my sister were exploring the woods behind our new house. It was pretty boring but breath taking in a way. There was a little creek that ran from the front of the woods to the rest of the houses and beautiful Willow trees. Me and my sister dipped our feet into the cold water and had lots of fun. But this is only the start of when things got weird.

It was 7pm and getting dark so my sister decided we should head back for the house. I agreed so we started walking back. I'm not sure why, but I felt like we were being watched. I looked behind me and far in the distance I could make the shape of a human but like a shadow figure. I couldn't tell if it was walking to us so I asked my sister to stop for a second. I explained to her that I think we're being watched. She, quite startled by this asked me why I think so. I pointed out in the distance where the figure was still standing. Alexa (my sister) told me we need to get to the house and she'll explain it. I didn't know why we were in such a hurry but I ran with her to the safety of our house. We locked the back door and sat in the living room.

A minute later of hard breathing, Alexa explained that the thing we saw was a ghost that we possibly led to our house. I shrugged my shoulders, honestly I didn't care all that much. Just a sprit wandering around our house, I didn't mind. 

I'd like to say my sister was right! The next day was very weird. My family woke up at around 6am hearing a woman scream ""help"" although no one was there that we knew of. Basically We all experienced something that day.

Our mom was cooking breakfast and went to the restroom when she heard a loud bang and came back to see pots and pans all over the floor.

Our dad was listening to his radio while drinking coffee and the radio oddly kept changing channels although no one was touching it. My younger sister, Sophia was watching tv and the tv kept changing channels oddly enough but she claimed to not have done anything. The when my older twin sister Alexa went outside she said that there was a floaty in the pool moving by itself. I was alone in the dining room the lights flickered but no one was around.

Ok so I hope you enjoyed this weird story, if you have any questions don't mind asking me."
"Anomaly Moving Through Our Conversation","Idaho","Orbs / Lights / Mists","Late September 2021

 Outside in my front yard this afternoon, sun is out I notice neighbor is out across the street and his garage door is open. My neighbor is retired, younger than I and I rarely see him. He is yelling from his driveway to me saying he likes the look of my yard.

 I took up all the grass in my yard 4 different colored rocks now and more flowers, no more mowing the front yard and have got a lot of comments. Instead of yelling I walk across the street towards his driveway. I am about 7 ft away from him (COVID) and he is in front of me and to my left. He says with all the Industrial building going on near our neighborhood he has noticed mice moving around in his home. I told him I have trapped a couple and have some roaming in my back yard. Did not mention Black V. He is telling me that he seen a mouse running in his hallway and it ran into a room with some clutter. Mice could really have fun in there so he found some sticky traps and set them all across the opening of that room and got a mouse. His garbage cans are next to him, to his right and he is very happy getting that mouse and kicks the garbage can and said he's in there.

 We kind of move to my right, he is on the sidewalk now, still to my left and we are looking at his dead grass. Due to his surgeries and broken sprinkler system, his yard was not watered all summer. I am still 7 ft away standing in the street looking at his front door, straight ahead of me.

 We were talking, and as I look towards him, I notice the air between us is distorted with an odd cloud-like energy moving between us, it's moving slow like walking speed. It is distorting all the colors in the yard and the red and white bricks on the the front of his house, but it seems to have small square grids to it? Very trippy looking, not a heat wave but controlled, like it was pixelated. It's about 3 ft wide and a little taller than me, and in front of me radiating? Like firing off different squares and now I am looking at its head area, and I know I smiled at it and it flowed past me slowly. I wanted to say DID YOU SEE THAT, but I held it in and he said nothing.

 He tells me that the maple tree I planted is going to get as big as his and could crack your foundation, and while he's talking, this energy seems to have returned and leaned in from my right side (with a head shape/space bigger than mine) and is now right in front of my face not 2 feet away suspended there for about 4 seconds, distorting, firing off little spots. I felt it was like HEY YOU SEE ME DON'T YOU? And it slowly went right and disappeared. That kind of blew the heat coming off asphalt debunking theory when it leaned back in.

 I was really struggling with this encounter. I told the wife I had to ask him if he also watched this move through us but also did not want to say anything. 

It's Halloween at 4:20 pm and I finally get up the nerve and go and knock on his door. I knock many times, finally door opens and he said he was napping, WHOOPS! He is a little irritated and I ask him if he also noticed anomaly moving between us last time we talked and this sounds a little crazy. He said no, didn't notice anything and you do sound a little crazy, and YOU DO KNOW IT'S HALLOWEEN raising his voice (I forgot it was Halloween). Anyway I told him I even wrote it on my calendar and said, take care, see ya, bye bye now. Boy I feel like a real BONEHEAD right now for bothering him, but I'm glad I asked and cleared that in my own mind. Thanks for reading and Good luck out there. Typed by me not her."
"Got What I Deserved","Florida","Haunted Places","Recently I was asked by a friend if I had any ghost stories. I had forgotten about this experience and thought where it is so close to Halloween I would relay it here. About a decade ago I was away with 2 friends for a girl's weekend at the beach. A family member owns a condo there and had kindly agreed to let us use it for a few days.

One of the nights there, we were sitting in the living room drinking wine and talking about events from our childhood. We had been out earlier in the evening and were winding down the day after hitting the beach and a few bars. Myself and a girlfriend, Amy, decided to play a joke on my other friend, Susan. Off of the main living area was a half bathroom. Susan was sitting in a chair with her back to the bathroom. One of us would get up to walk into the kitchen and would turn the water on in the bathroom. Then sit back down. Yes, I admit it. We were terrible for doing this. 

Each time Susan would hear the water running, she would get up from her chair and question us about it. We denied knowing how the water had mysteriously gotten turned on. At one point I said out loud, ""If there is a ghost in here, move that lamp."" There was a floor lamp located next to the sofa in the living room. After a few times of us pulling this prank, Susan got up, got her shoes on, and was going to leave. We finally told her it was us messing with her. I felt horrible because she was clearly scared. 

After apologizing profusely to Susan, the three of us went into the kitchen to get some wine. The kitchen is fairly small but has a cut out that allows you to look into the living room area. As I was apologizing to Susan, who had her back to the living room, I hugged her. As I faced the living room something caught my eye. The lamp (I get chills just typing this) that I asked to be moved if there was a ghost in there, was now rocking back and forth by itself! Now the only one somewhat scared was me. I had received my just desserts.

As we still had a few days left to our vacation, I did not mention it to either of my friends. I waited until we left and were traveling back to the Tampa area before I brought that up. I was clearly the only one that noticed the lamp moving. Thankfully Susan has long since forgiven me but I will never mess around like that again. Lesson learned."
"Exit 40","Texas","Misc","In 1999, my mother and father were on a trip from Oklahoma to visit us in California. Along the way they pulled over to change drivers. 

My mother called me, and told me that he had a heart attack and died along the road side in Albuquerque.

My brother and sisters picked me up after I finished working all night in Sacramento. We travelled East in three cars.

I remember getting to Albuquerque in the morning, I had just woke up and was ready to take my turn driving.

I looked around thinking this was the place my mother said my father died.

Our three cars continued East, as we were all chattering back and forth on the two way radios.

Occasionally we would stop for gas or a snack.

We were cruising along at 70 mph per hour as we approached Amarillo, Texas. I was driving the last car, when at speed the engine just stopped. I repeatedly tried to call on the radio, but couldn't get through the chatter. The other vehicles were soon out of range of the radio as I coasted off the freeway and into a Love's Gas Station at Exit 40.

After some time the other two cars doubled back and found me, so six of us were together at the station.

My brother and I looked at the engine, there was nothing obviously wrong. We had gas, oil, and the car was a fairly new car.

After some time we were able to restart, after doing little more than inspecting the engine.

We continued our trip to Allen, Oklahoma, arriving that evening. We apologized to my mom for being later than expected and told her of our break down at Exit 40 in Amarillo.

She told us ""That's where your father died.""

""What? I thought you said Albuquerque?""

She said "" I may have, when I called you I was kind of out of it""

I look back now at this and think, ghosts? Coincidence? Out of all the exits between Sacramento, California and Allen Oklahoma, why this one. The only trouble going there and back. The event brought most of my brother and sisters to the very spot where my father died.

WHAT ARE THE ODDS?"
"Ghost In Our Home","Tennessee","Haunted Places","My husband Alan and I bought an old house outside of Murfreesboro, TN. We had to beg, borrow and nearly steal enough money to buy the property and hire the contractors to get the house habitable.

 We knew nothing of the history of the house, other than the fact it hadn't been lived in since the early 1900's. The house was 2 story and had obviously experienced major renovation. The front of the house was older and of a completely different architectural style than the rear.

 There was no animal life on the property. It was on 5 acres 14 miles northeast of Murfreesboro. This part of Tennessee is lousy with all manner of wildlife. Coyotes, racoons, possum, and deer in particular. There was a constant stream across the back of the property with easy access. There was no reason why we shouldn't have seen animals on a regular basis. There weren't even tracks at the stream. We didn't even have birds on the property.

 The team working for the contractor reported they constantly felt like they were being watched. As time wore on, the workers began to complain their tools were coming up missing, only to be found later, always inside the house. 

Through all of this, we had never gotten upstairs to the 2nd story. There was one stairwell behind a very heavy wooden door. Try as we might, we couldn't get the door open. The only thing we could do would be to ruin the door by taking it off the hinges. For some reason this was unacceptable to me. A friend of ours, Scott, who was helping us with what work we could do ourselves to save on repair cost climbed a ladder and looked down through the window in the stairwell. He saw a couch and several rolls of carpet leaned against the door, blocking it.

When the workers were done with the main floor, Alan, Scott and I were to finish off the remaining work. This was mainly painting the walls and baseboards. We were almost done. Alan and Scott left to go to the hardware store and to get dinner for the 3 of us. They would be gone for about 2 hours. I had the last baseboard left, then planned on taking a well earned hot bath before the guys got back home. 

I wrapped up my work, went to the bath and ran the water for my bath. The last thing I remembered was sitting on the bed and lying back for a moment. 

The next thing I remember, Alan was waking me up. I guess I had been sound asleep. I vaguely remembered running the water for my bath. Alan mentioned something about the water still being hot, so I must have just run the bath. This sort of confused me because I'd started the bath well over an hour before. The water should have been cold by then. I didn't remember even turning the water off. I shook off the sense of confusion because I was struggling so much to try to wake up. 

 I sat down at the table with the guys. They'd grabbed KFC for the 3 of us. I realized then I still had my gloves on from painting the baseboard. I slipped the gloves off, not even bothering to wash my hands. I remember being famished. I was starving and felt, for lack of a better description, drunk. I'd just loaded my plate with dinner when something caught my eye. My wedding rings were missing. I can count on one hand the number of times I've ever taken my rings off. They're not anything special, nothing gaudy. It's just that they're my wedding rings. I rarely wear much in the way of jewelry. It's just not my style. The sentimental attachment I have to them is so important to me. And they were gone.

At first I though Alan and Scott were playing a joke on me. For minutes I believed they were pranking me. When they finally convinced me they had nothing to do with it, we began searching the house. The 3 of us spent over an hour tearing up the first floor, trying to find them. We had no luck.

I spent the next several weeks constantly on the lookout for my rings with no success. Alan only once mentioned buying me a new set. Aside from the fact that we didn't really have the money for it, I refused to give up on finding MY rings.

All during this time I began to feel a constant presence in the house. Alan said he never felt anything. Scott, our friend, who is very attuned spiritually, said he also sensed a presence, but only briefly then it would go away. 

After a couple of months Alan and I finally managed to build our nest egg back up to begin working on the upstairs. I still insisted that we not damage the door, so Scott and Alan went back up the ladder, slipped in through the window in the stairwell and dropped in. The 2 of them moved the couch and carpet rolls aside, allowing us to open the door. Scott's wife, Alex was there with me, helping me open the door. The 4 of us went up the stairs and began exploring the 2nd floor. We had to be careful as much of the flooring was rotted. We each sort of went our own way. The rooms were covered in dust, dirt and cobwebs. What light there was came in as sunlight through the windows. 

After a few minutes I heard Scott call for us. The room he was exploring was down the hall, around the bend and at the end of another short hallway. He was standing in in front of a bureau, basically a fancy desk with several small drawers. One of the drawers had been pulled open. He looked at me and told me to look inside.

My wedding rings were in the drawer sitting on top of a dingy old journal wrapped in a ribbon that was probably red a long time ago. I accused him of doing this, again saying he was pranking me. Alan and Scott's wife, Alex finally convinced me Scott would never do such a thing. But what other explanation could there be?

The workers we hired to repair the upstairs reported the same sort of incidences the previous workers had. They claimed to feel like someone was always watching them. Tools would come up missing, but would always be found on the main floor.

 For his part Alan began to get impatient with all of this going on. He insisted there was nothing going on except overwrought imagination. Even when the work was done Alan was feeling more and more upset on the subject. By then I had a constant sense someone was watching me. If I brought the subject up Alan would get angry with me. Our entire lifesavings was tied up in the house. I was the one that wanted the house at the outset more than him. Now that we had it, I was the one who was constantly ""complaining"". It got to the point I wouldn't even bring the subject up to him anymore.

For the next year plus I began to feel more and more alone, isolated. I wasn't getting enough sleep anymore and would nap off during the day. When I would nap I would have intense dreams that I wouldn't remember when I awoke. The only thing I could recall was that someone or something was touching me. Over time these feelings became more and more intense. I would awake from one of these naps and find my clothes had been moved, altered. Since I worked from home I could dress casually, usually jeans and a t-shirt. When I would wake up from one of these intense dreams I would find my t-shirt lifted to my shoulders and my jeans opened. Sometimes my panties were pulled down with my jeans. 

My energy level was at a constant low ebb. I couldn't talk to my own husband about any of this. I was spending my days just going through the motions. 

The dividing line was the night I am convinced I was raped by whatever was in the house.

It was night. Alan and I were in bed. He was sound asleep. I was watching TV, basically zoned out and barely aware of whatever show I was watching. I heard footsteps coming down the hallway. I was accustomed to this. I was so worn down by all of this it no longer bothered me anymore. The footsteps stopped at the door, like they always did. As always, I expected to hear the footsteps walk away, as though someone was walking away from the door. That didn't happen this time. The door to our bedroom began to slowly open. I heard steps entering our bedroom and stop by the bed. This time, because this had never happened before, I was focused wide eyed at the space by my bed. I was suddenly frightened. This had never, ever happened before.

 I reached over to shake Alan to wake him up. He didn't budge. He was out cold. I whispered his name, begging him to wake up and help me. He wasn't snoring, he just wouldn't wake up. The sound I heard was something between a growl and a chuckle. I wasn't alone and whatever it was, it was laughing at me? The covers slowly slid down my body and off the bed. Alan still didn't wake up. I wear sweats and a tank top to bed. I felt a ""hand"" tugging at my sweatpants, pulling them down. I punched Alan, yelling at him to wake up. Nothing happened. I tried to roll off the bed to get up, to get away. I felt a hand at my throat slamming me against my headboard. My sweatpants were pulled off and something grabbed my left ankle and pulled me down, forcing me onto my back on the bed. Whatever assaulted me marked me up.

 The pain of the attack was nothing like I'd ever experienced before in my life. It wouldn't stop. I felt a clawed hand at my throat, holding me in place. The other hand alternated between squeezing my breasts, raking it's claws over my stomach and occasionally was playing with my wedding rings, twirling them around my finger. At one point I felt it tugging at them. I passed out at some point during the rape, the pain was that bad. When I woke up I was laying naked on the bed. Some oily substance covered me from my inner thighs to my crotch. I had scratches on my face, hands, fingers, legs, chest, shoulders and over my stomach. My legs were draped over the edge of the bed nearly touching the floor. Alan was still sound asleep.

We had several guns in the house for home defense. I'm not saying I was thinking remotely clearly, but I grabbed my 9mm from my nightstand and ran to the office nook off the den. I can't tell you why, but I felt safe there. I guess because nothing ever happened to me when I was there? I finally dropped off to sleep. Alan woke me up when he was leaving for work. All he could say to me was to ask why I tore the bed up. I literally sat there, just blinking at him. 

During the day, whenever I felt at all that something might be happening I would run to my office nook. Even when I didn't feel like something was going on, I stayed in the nook all I could. The longest time I was away from my safe place was when I showered. I kept scrubbing myself, scouring my inner thighs and crotch. Even when I'd washed away the goo, I could still feel it. When it was time for Alan to come home I ran out of the house and waited for him by the driveway. 

We were going to have a talk about what had happened to me. I hadn't imagined it. It wasn't a bad dream or a nightmare. It wasn't some messed up wet dream. Someone or something was in the house and it had raped me. I needed my husband to believe me and help me.

He blew me off and told me it was my imagination. I asked him to explain the scratches on my body, going so far as to jerk my t-shirt up to show them to him. He said they were self inflicted. When I grabbed his arm and demanded he pay attention to me, he wheeled and glared at me in a way he'd never done before. Like all married couples, we've had our arguments. They'd never gotten physical, but Alan had a temper and I knew what it looked like. This was exponentially worse. I swear he looked at me like he was ready to kill me. All he would say was that I needed to ""get over whatever horny dream I was having"" and ""leave him the hell alone"". He yanked his arm away from me and marched into the house.

I had never felt so alone and abandoned in my life.

Nothing happened for the next several nights. On the 6th night after my rape I heard the footsteps again. I grabbed my pistol, knowing full well it was useless but I grabbed it anyway, and ran to the nook. I could still hear the footsteps but nothing happened. The same thing happened the next night and again, I ran to the nook. If it's possible to sense frustration and anger, it was virtually palatable. Whatever this was, was angry with me. Nothing happened the eighth night after my attack. Alan had gotten into the habit of not even waking me up when he left, whether I was in bed or in the nook. 

I had a bunch of errands to run that day, so I woke up with Alan already gone. I was so pissed that he was ignoring me and it was very much affecting our marriage. Our plan was always to get the house, save up our money then start our family. I could still work from home even with a baby, so things SHOULD have been going according to schedule. Problem was, Alan and I weren't having sex. At all. That had never been an issue before. We were always so active sexually when we were dating and when we first got married. Since we moved to the house the frequency was getting less and less. By the point of my attack it had been months since we'd even been interested.

I got in the shower and started scheduling my daily itinerary. I never heard the footsteps. I never knew the danger I was in until it was too late. The shower curtain jerked aside. Before I knew what was happening I felt a clawed hand at my throat slamming me against the shower wall. I hit the wall so hard it knocked my breath out. The clawed hands pinned my wrists above my head. I was raped a 2nd time. The pain was just as bad, but this time I wasn't lucky enough to pass out. That's how I looked at it anyway. The difference this time was I smelled it's breath, or what I assumed was it's breath. It was so awful, I can only describe it as noxious.

 It made no sound while it was assaulting me, but again it played with my wedding rings. There was no sound until it was done. I collapsed into the tub when it was done and let me drop. I swear I could hear it laughing. 

When I could collect myself, I barely took the time to get dressed and fled the house. When I felt like I was far enough away from the house to be safe, I pulled over and started crying. I couldn't stop. Some people took mercy on me, came over to me to see if I was ok. I just told them I was fine. I couldn't talk to Alan because he didn't believe me or seem to care. I'd been progressively cut off from my friends, but desperately needed someone to talk to. With no other option, I called Alex at work. She left work to come to basically rescue me. That's what it felt like anyway. We met at a park where we could talk without being interrupted. I told her everything. I left nothing out. I suddenly realized just how crazy my story sounded. I felt like an idiot.

 Alex was just the best. She didn't interrupt, had plenty of tissues ready for me and just listened. When I was done she said we were going back to the house just long enough for me to collect a few things and she was taking me to her house. I dreaded walking back into the house. Even Alex said she'd never felt so much anger or aggression. I was there long enough to throw some things in a bag and we left. Alex wouldn't leave me alone for even a moment. We didn't talk, didn't say one word. 

I called Alex from my cellphone after we left. I told him what I was doing, where I was going and why. He had a fit. He yelled and screamed so loud Alex could hear him clearly. I was embarrassing him. I was having a nervous breakdown. When he was done yelling at me he hung up on me. I cried for the rest of the night. Unbeknownst to me, Alan called Scott and yelled at him because Alex, Scott's wife, was interfering in his marriage. Bless his heart, Scott knew nothing about it and took a verbal chewing for me. 

Alex insisted I tell Scott everything when he finally got home. Scott was just as patient with me as Alex had been. When I was done Scott said I wasn't to go back to the house until he checked it out. Alan could just get over his damn self, per Scott. This was Alan's friend. 

First thing first, Scott began to dig into the history of the property. He wasn't going back to the house until he had some sense of what he was walking into.

 When he was done with that, Scott went to the house, but didn't go in. He was there for Alan. My husband put up a massive fuss, but Scott finally convinced him to stay with him and Alex, just for a couple of nights. It was the weekend, so work wasn't going to be a problem.

Alan changed almost immediately. The first night at Scott and Alex's house he easily slept for 10 hours. I probably slept longer. When he woke up he acted like he'd just had his first real night of sleep in months. It took a couple of days, but Alan and I started talking. Alan wasn't still sure what to believe, but at least he was listening to me. I was crying a lot around this time. It just felt like such a weight was being taken off my shoulders.

Then Scott finally wrapped up his investigation into the property's history. 

Briefly, the original house had been built in 1850, about 11 years before the Civil War. Murfreesboro was the site of a major Civil War battle, the Battle for Stone's River. Just prior to the battle there had been smaller skirmishes.

 It was during one of these skirmishes that 4 Union soldiers deserted their unit. They came upon a family to the south and west of Nashville. They raped the owner's wife and killed the family. Their unit commander discovered what they'd done and immediately placed them under arrest. With Stone's River upcoming, there wasn't time to have a court martial just yet. Instead the company commander ordered one of his officers and 2 enlisted men to escort the prisoners back to Nashville. 

When the weather turned ugly, the officer came upon a house, OUR house. He arranged with the owner to keep the prisoners in the barn and they would wait out the winter storm. The weather kept up so the officer sent one of his men to Nashville to notify corps command where they were and why they were there. The next day area residents reported the house, OUR house, as well as the barn, was burned down. The family and all the Union soldiers were dead. The Union closed the case as all involved were dead.

 Scott speculated that any number of things could have occurred:

The prisoners got loose, killed their captors, attacked the family and burned the house down. There was something to this as all 4 prisoners were found inside the house, not the barn. The officer and other guard were found in the barn, also burned to death.

The owner, known to be friendly to the Confederacy, killed the officer and guard and the prisoners got loose. Unlikely but possible.

Local citizens, also friendly to the Confederate cause, attacked the house and killed everyone in an effort to kill the Union soldiers.

Scott knew an empath, Leigh who was willing to do an onsite investigation with him 2 weeks later. If I have to mention it, we were still staying with Scott and Alex.

What Scott and Leigh were able to deduce was even worse than he'd speculated.

There were only 2 spirits in the house. Ana Rose Hastings, the wife of the owner, and her only child, her son Hiram. Hiram had virtual free run of the house and attacked Leigh several times. Per Leigh, Hiram was afraid of Scott and cursed her whenever Scott was interfering with him. Ana Rose, Hiram's mother, was chiefly located in my office nook. 

Hiram was the spirit who attacked me.

His mother, Ana Rose, protected me whenever she could. 

Hiram was so much more powerful than his mother. 

Ana Rose finally relented and told Leigh what happened.

Hiram had been hanging out with the prisoners. He was 16 years old at the time. Somehow, Ana Rose wasn't sure, Hiram freed them and helped them kill their captors. Hiram was going to run away with the prisoners. They wanted to go into the house to finish waiting out the storm, grab enough supplies for their journey, then they'd leave. Hiram's father, Cyrus, got into a fight with the prisoners. He killed 2 of them.

 Cyrus grabbed his belt and began beating Hiram for his actions. The other 2 prisoners turned on Cyrus and killed him as well.

 Ana Rose sobbed as she told Leigh that, not only did the 2 Union prisoners rape her, but Hiram did as well. He killed his mother when he was done with her. Then the prisoners turned on Hiram, knocking him unconscious and setting the house and barn on fire. Somehow the fire spread too quickly and the Union prisoners were caught in the fire and perished.

Per Ana Rose, the house sat empty for so long. Only she and Hiram wandered the property. She gave the name Jenkins, no first names, as the next residents.

 Scott's research indicated the Jenkins family bought and renovated the house in 1879. Spiritualism was popular at the time and the Jenkins family and friends began invoking spirits, reaching out to the netherworld for contact. This turned Hiram loose once and for all. Ana Rose said Hiram assaulted Mrs. Jenkins and her 15 year old daughter. The family abandoned the property in 1895. 

The county seized it for back taxes and it sat empty until 1909. That's when Javier Colon-Issa bought the property. He tried to renovate it again and wanted to make it a hotel. The effort failed and Colon-Issa abandoned the property 14 months later.

 We were the next official residents. Unofficially, both Scott and Leigh discovered that in 1975 teens began hanging out there. Satanism was popular among teens and these were no different. They began holding seances, invoking demonic rites and holding Satanic rituals. Ana Rose claimed it was all she could do to keep the property safe from demonic presence. Hiram was working to invite demons to aid him.

Ana Rose blamed herself for what happened to me. She was so afraid of her son and the damage done.

Scott has worked with 3 teams that have cleared properties of poltergeist and demonic possession. They have had mixed success. He got no where trying to get Hiram to leave peacefully or otherwise. When he made this attempt, it was the only time Hiram actively engaged with Scott. Seems like it was more out of fear and defense than anything else.

Alan had finally had enough. He ultimately agreed to sell the house. We basically lost our savings and were wiped out as we still had bills to pay to a couple of the contractors. 

Our marriage suffered and it's still not the same and at this point it never will be. We never got around to having kids, largely because I had no interest in having a physical relationship with Alan. We have even gone as far as separating twice and discussed divorce. We always got back together, but we're almost more like friends than husband and wife. 

The guy who bought the house knows the history. Tennessee has some interesting laws. Among them, if you have reason to believe your property might be haunted, you have to disclose it. The buyer actually seemed to like the idea. He had no wife or family, so there's that. I have no idea if he's had issues with the house or not. Alan and I occasionally check to see if the house has been sold or abandoned again. The buyer is still there, apparently."
"My Grandma's Ghost (part 2)","South Dakota","Family / Friends Visits","So I am back hello once again everybody. This is in kind of the same vein as my last story, as you can tell by the title, but this one is about my other grandma, my mom's mom. She died when my mom was 20 of ovarian cancer, so I never met her. So let's get going, shall we?

So earlier this year (May of 2021, I don't know when this'll be posted), my family went to south Dakota to visit my grandpa and step grandma because they're old and we go to see them every once in a while just to see how they're doing, you know? Well, we were sitting at the table, eating lunch, and all of a sudden, my grandpa starts telling this story. He was napping in his chair, in his den (that's what he calls his office), and all of a sudden, this woman shows up in his doorway. She doesn't say anything; she just smiles, and then she disappears. Instantly, I think that could be my biological grandma. I think my mom thinks it could be her mom, too. My step grandma kind of brushes it off, because I don't think she believes in ghosts, and she's used to him rambling, because he's old. My grandpa's in his late 80s, and you know how old people are. They kind of like to ramble about random stuff. Also, she's a no nonsense kind of person.

 Anyway, I didn't ask him about it in the moment for a couple reasons. First off, I didn't want to remind him of my biological grandma, because I thought it might make him sad. Second off, I didn't want to talk about my biological grandma in front of my step grandma because I didn't know if she would like it. I don't know why but I thought it might've made her angry. You know the whole thing about not talking about your exes in front of your wife/girlfriend? Yeah. Anyway, we kept on talking, kind of glossing over that, but obviously, I kept on thinking about it. 

So later that night, I was in bed, in our air bnb, when I felt that same feeling I was talking about in my last story. I knew it was my biological grandma. I didn't even have to think about it this time. Who else would it have been? I could feel her standing over me, just looking at me. Just like last time, I couldn't see her, but I could feel her. I got up and went to go turn on a little light in my closet, because her presence was a little unsettling, but she didn't go away like my other grandma did, which I thought was interesting. She just sat down in a chair in the corner of my room and continued watching me. I thought it was really comforting and peaceful. Just the two of us, sharing a moment, you know? Eventually, her presence started to fade away. It wasn't like I felt her presence one moment and then the next moment I didn't. It was very gradual. I just felt her fade out of my bedroom. Again, it was extremely sweet and I loved it. 

A couple days later, we were heading back to Colorado, and we stopped at this motel in Nebraska. Side note here, but it literally looked like that motel had not been renovated since the 50s. It was kind of cool actually. Anyway, the first night that we were there, my grandma showed up again. I first felt her presence by my bed, and then she walked over to my parents' bed, which was in the same room. I have a theory that the reason she did that was because she wanted to see my mom. She hadn't seen her daughter in so long, so I think she just wanted to see her again. Then she just stood by the door for a little bit. I didn't feel her presence fade this time, though. I think she might've faded out after I had gone to sleep I don't know.

I loved this experience, just like I loved the last one, but I'm a little concerned. If you remember my last story (you can go read it if you don't), my dad's mom showed up on Christmas, and within a year, my aunt died. So I'm worried a similar situation is going to happen here. I love my grandpa and I don't want him to die yet! Another sign that's kind of concerning is the fact that my grandpa actually saw her. I don't know for sure if that was my grandma, or if it was just a random woman, but it would make sense that it was her. If he is going to die soon, at least he got to see her one last time."
"Haunting Beachfront Playground","Hawaii","Haunted Places","In 1954, I was a 10 years old tomboy who likes to play rough games with boys and never afraid of anything. I lived in a small countryside town on the west side of the island on Kauai which is Kekaha-""ThePlace"". My house was on the beachfront. I have many childhood playmates from next door neighbor & neighborhood. They are boys and girls ages 4 years - 11 years old.

On weekends, when no school, we all run down to the beach to play in the sand, sun and surf. There is a big sandy area where we all play which is an old Hawaiian graveyard since the 1800s. There are no markings or headstones, but some barbed wire fence enclosures. On this one Saturday, the weather was beautiful with clear blue skies as usual in Hawaii.

Upon playing and running on the sand towards the highway, the sand caved down on me and I fell through a wooden coffin.

When I looked in, it was a tall skeleton intact remains with its both hands crossed below its belly button. One of the boys said to me to give him a front tooth which I did. Then he wanted the skull, two arm bones & 2 leg bones. I passed them up to him.

Later, I ask them to help pull me up. After gathering skeletal remains, the boys say let's play baseball.

I was the pitcher holding the skull and the 11 years old boy was the batter. I pitched the skull under hand. The boy missed hitting the skull. Then when I pitched again he hit the skull & it cracked on the forehead area with a hole.

A few minutes later dark clouds gathered with light thunder then started to rain. We all grabbed the skeletal remains and started to run home across the Highway. Suddenly Drums sounded BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! The Hawaiian Warriors plays drums during ceremonies. 

We all ran so fast to my next door neighbor house. We put the skeletal remains on the old Hawaiian man's porch. It was pouring hard and the thunder stopped, but the drums continued. Then Tutu (old Hawaiian man) came out and saw the skeletal bones & Yelled to us kids by saying; What you kids did? TAKE these bones back as they are Kapu sacred!

 Then the other Hawaiian man came out after hearing all the commotion. He then told us kids we all going back to the place to bury the bones. He put the bones in a burlap brown bag and drove a grader to dig a hole across where the gravesite is. We pray & ask for forgiveness.

When me, and my two sisters went home, we got scolding from my father. That evening while we were having dinner in the dining room, the lights flickered in & out! My father explained to us three girls about Hawaiian graveyard & to respect.

For us innocent kids did not know better.

That night me & my two sisters got sick with fever which subsided the next day. Our dogs were HOWLING for awhile!

The following day us kids went back to look at the place where the brown burlap bag was buried. To all of our dismay, the hole was opened. We all walked across to where I fell through on the gravesite & seen the hole covered with the brown burlap bag of bones empty on the sand. Suddenly a strong wind blew down on us. We all looked at each other! SPOOKY!

Later we walked toward the beach to sit & talk story. This tall Hawaiian bearded man approached us kids & said behave kids & no be Kolohe (Troublemaker). He walked away & disappeared & never see him again there.

We all had a very haunting weekend! Now we are older & have our own family & lives, but we connect with each other time to time.

Whenever, I do go back to my hometown of Kekaha, Kauai, I do visit that Hawaiian gravesite for respect. I noticed that there are Real Estate for sale signs posted. I later put in a call to one of the Realtors to meet with her regarding the property sale across my old home. Upon giving her details of that beachfront property, she decided to remove the sale sign.

Private Property- Hawaiian Graveyard."
"Friendly Ghosts At The Hospital","Hawaii","Haunted Places","In the year 2000, I encountered Chicken skin experiences. I was a Secretary in the Employee Health Department at The Queen's Medical Center in Honolulu.

One day I had to retrieve a former employee record which is in storage on Tower 6th floor of the main hospital. The records are stored in boxes. Upon opening the box, I heard boxes shuffling and I asked is anyone there? The shuffling stopped.

 When I walked toward the elevator after locking the storage door, I felt like someone following me to the elevator. Upon entering the elevator, I pressed the #1 button for first floor. Suddenly as the elevator door was closing, it was held back to open. Then I saw this huge, tall, bluish human figure enter and press the # 5 button! I put my head down and it became so very ""Cold"" and smelled of Moth balls.

 The elevator door opened on the 5th floor & I saw this bluish human figure exit. My hairs on my head and arms stood up.

 When I reached to the 1st level and the elevator door opened, this Mail room employee saw my eyes wide open. I grabbed him and he said you saw it too huh? My face was white like a ghost & clammy hands he said to me. He told to Calm down & he walked me down to my office. My colleagues asked me what happened Pat? You look like you saw a ghost! The Queen's Medical Center is built on a Hawaiian graveyard. That was a friendly Hawaiian Warrior ghost. No harm to me done.

The following day while walking to my office in the morning, a pure white dove approached me within eye level & flapping its wings with piercing golden eyes in slow motion. I was awe struck & put my both arms up to protect my face. It suddenly flew away. Employee's witnessed my motions of holding my arms up & did not see the white dove flapping before my face. They say we believe you Pat!

Thereafter, I walked up to the 3rd floor to a break room before heading down to my office. I sat down in a chair to read the local newspaper. Someone passed the break room so I stood up to see who it was. I seen a half human white figure moving towards the opposite end of the floor. It suddenly disappeared. I rushed myself out of the break room when the rocking chair started to move back & forth with no one sitting on. I could feel my hairs standing up! I heard from what I encountered in the break room, that Registered nurses lived in that building when it was a Nursing quarters called Harkness building. Nurses died during their residence there.

Ever since all my Ghostly experiences there at the hospital, I never had any encounter's thereafter."
"Former Skeptic Incident 9/26/2021","New Jersey","Misc","It has been along time since there has been any incidents in my home. Since my last entry many years ago things have been really quiet. It's almost like everything just stopped. Since my last entry there has been many changes in my life. Marriage, job, new family members, dogs... Something happened today that definitely spooked me.

 I was sitting on the second floor of my two-story home in my comfortable easy chair. On the arm of the chair was my cell phone. It was plugged in and charging but at about 50% battery. I checked a text, press the Apple home key, and set the phone back down on the arm of the chair.

 Since my last entry other than being married I have now two small dogs. It was getting late and I wanted to take the dogs out for their last bathroom break. I scooped up the heavier older one, carried him downstairs and into my backyard. There I waited while he did his business. I came up the stairs, put him back on the couch, and scooped up the other dog. The entire time my wife is sitting next to the dogs on the couch. As I am carrying the dog into the room with the harness and leash my landline rings. The caller ID talks and says ""call from my last name). Just my last name, not my first. I assume the call was from a relative. My wife gets up and hands me the phone and I look at the number and it's my cell phone number. The cell phone that is sitting on the arm of my chair plugged in. I told my wife this and she runs over to my chair to see if there is a call going on. It was really kind of shocking to see that.

 I finished taking the dog out and came back in to examine my phone. My cell phone does not have the landline at my home listed anywhere in the contacts. I have no idea how or why my cell phone randomly dialed my landline when it should have no business knowing what my landline number is.

 After that my little dog who is a few years old trots into the dining room and begins to half growl and bark at the wall. He put his tail between his legs and he continues to growl. This is not like him whatsoever. He does not do this behavior ever. This went on for about five minutes until I had to scoop him up and take him, the other dog, and my wife into another room. This just happened maybe a few hours ago and I've decided to quickly post it here before I forget all the details. If anything more happens I'll edit this story. If nothing happens then you won't be hearing from me for a while. Be well."
"Spirit Voice On The Beach 2","California","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","This is a short, but very interesting update to my previous experience at Arroyo Burro Beach in Santa Barbara California 'Spirit voice on the beach'. Please read that experience if you haven't yet.

I have researched known ghosts of Santa Barbara several times over the years to try to find the ghost I heard that night. Now I think I have, the Eling's Park ""Queen Maab"" ghost.

Search this book in Google books, pg. 117- 'Spooky Trails and Tall Tales California: Hiking the Golden State's Legends', the link is much too long.

Also;

Map of Eling's Park just north and basically attached to Arroyo Burro Beach Park-

 Https://www.google.com/maps/search/santa+barbara+eling+park

I'm surprised I never found this before now. She fits my experience quite well, I think, with the 'whispering in the ear' part from the book in that first link and other aspects of the Eling's Park ghost descriptions.

I was reminded of this experience and looked into it again because I've gotten back into painting, and I'm working on a piece that I started several years ago depicting my brother and I on the beach one night getting a rude awakening when we fell asleep in our sleeping bags too close to the incoming tide, lolol!

I'm planning to paint a small figure representing the ghost lady up on the cliffs above us. Yes, I slept on the beach once more after the ghost experience, I guess I felt braver with my brother. We didn't have any paranormal experiences that night, just a very cold and unexpected soak in the ocean!"
"Fiddler On Church Steps","Missouri","Misc","First of all I have to put the obligatory ""long time reader, first time submitting"". I have been reading this website on a near nightly basis for a long time, I love it. Second, I'm not really positive that this was a spirit. It could have just been a person, but it was supremely strange and definitely had a supernatural air about it, and I cannot be for sure if it was a ghost or not!

I used to work at a movie theater and would sometimes get off of work between midnight and two o'clock in the morning. One such night I was driving home and was in the suburbs nearing my home. It was dark and very quiet because, after all, it was quite late at night and there weren't many cars out and no pedestrians.

I slowly drove by a church on my passenger side that I was pretty familiar with. This was my home town and I had passed the church countless times, and had even been inside several times. There was a stop sign right in front of the church, so I had to come to a halt, but as I was approaching the church I noticed a figure on the front steps. This was a little strange because of the time of night, but as I drew closer and I could take in more details things got even stranger.

The front of the church has just a small set of wide steps that lead to double doors. Above the doors is a large circular window that is made of stained glass and is illuminated beautifully at night. Standing at the top of the steps was an elderly man, wearing a ""newsboy"" type cap. What I found to be peculiar, however, was that he was playing a violin. I had my windows rolled up so I couldn't hear the music, but even so, as I slowed to a halt at the stop sign, he slowly lowered the fiddle from his chin and looked right at me. Eventually he had the violin and bow down at his sides and was following my car with his head (it was too dark to make out his face or eyes).

I didn't stick around at the stop sign to take a closer look. I was seriously creeped out! It was like something out of a folktale. Again, I don't know for sure if it was a spirit or a live person or WHAT but it stayed with me to this day and I kind of wish I could have stopped to talk to him or just listen to the music. As spooky as it was, it was kind of magical at the same time.

I can't promise I will get back to any comments in a timely fashion, but I would love to hear if anyone has a similar experience. I love it when people respond to stories with similar experiences they have had or folkloric references, I think its fascinating. Thanks for reading!"
"Bubble Lady Took My Daughter","Arizona","Haunted Places","We went to stay the night at my mothers house. My husband and my 4 young children were already asleep on the pallet we made on the Livingroom floor. I was still laying there trying to fall asleep. Down the hallway I see what looks like a bubble in the shape of a woman. She is slowly moving down the hallway towards the Livingroom. At first, I think I am just seeing things and just need to get some sleep. But she keeps getting closer and closer. As she enters the Livingroom I start getting scared and start shaking my husband to wake up. My 6mo old baby girl is laying next to us on her back with one of her legs bent. The closer this bubble lady came to us, the harder I am shaking my husband. I yell his name and right as he jumps awake, my daughter starts getting dragged across the Livingroom floor by her leg! My husband jumps up and grabs her right before she gets to the hallway. We just sat there for the rest of the night, wide awake holding our children tightly in our arms. 

That house has always had a thickness in the air and paranormal things happening. My 3 year old daughter use to wake up in the middle of the night and start playing with her ""friends"". We would hear her talking to someone and then see her run by on the baby monitor then see 3 little shadows running after her on the wall. She even told us that her ""friends"" were dead and they would tell her to go with them. We asked her where they go and she went to the back bedroom and pointed into the closet and said, ""they go in here""."
"We Are All Connected","Oregon","Misc","I was talking with a friend that told me she didn't believe in coincidences, that there really are no accidents and every thing happens for a reason. As I sat alone and pondered this thought I came to the conclusion that things are meant to ""go wrong"" on this planet to teach us something. 

It's getting close to the time now for everyone that knew Judy to go to her funeral service. I found some beautiful poems about life and death and put a different one in cards to Judy's husband, son, and daughter. We will always love and miss Judy.

For some reason I have an aunt that passed away years ago too and she's been on my mind a lot. One of the last stories I wrote on another website I added memories of her in it. I try to remember the dates they have all passed away, and light a candle for them then before I go to sleep. I will do that on their birthdays too. I couldn't remember her birthday but knew I wrote it down somewhere...

I was watching TV this past weekend when I saw a movie about Mars. It was one of those ""B"" flicks that everyone laughs about. I told Mr. C I read somewhere ""real happenings"" are added to these made up movies to get the public's reaction. Hmmm, interesting. As I was watching the show and wondering if a big reveal will happen soon about aliens and other things hidden from us, a scene came on TV where a couple was walking underneath the sign of a movie theater. It listed the movies that would be playing and the actors. One of the actors name was JUDY WEST! That's my friends name that we were about to have a funeral service for?! 

I've always remembered when my aunt Cora passed away but have never remembered her birthday. I was on Face Book looking for family that is left. I don't go on there often. Each time you log on they will show you some past memories of years gone by on that date. There it was, a memory of me talking about how I missed my aunt Cora and had been thinking of her on her birthday on August the 13th! The memory was from 2010, what are the odds that I happened to log on to Face Book that particular day?! I had just missed her birthday by five days.

So when these two events just recently happened I didn't take it lightly or dismiss it. When I saw my friends name on TV I laughed and yelled out ""hi Judy!"" Then just days later finding a post from 9 years ago on face book about my aunt Cora, I said ""I'm so happy I know your birthday now and will write it down so I don't forget again."" Do I believe they were talking to me from the other side? YES! Everything truly is connected!"
"Man In The White Suit","Texas","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I saw a man appear beside my bed when I was about 6 years old. I lived in Texas on Ashley Road, I believe it was near Katy, Tx. His hair was black and slicked back. He wore a white suit with a red rose in the front pocket. It reminds me of a prom outfit on someone from the old days now that I'm older. He glowed so bright it lit up my whole room. I remember being terrified and paralyzed. I was trying to move, but it felt like every part of my body was being pushed down on the bed. I opened my mouth to scream but nothing came out. I think he may have tried to speak to me but I was so terrified I have no recollection of what he said. He vanished after what felt like forever but was probably no more than a few minutes. And it was as if I had been screaming the whole time because as soon as he was gone my voice was so loud it was like I had been screaming the whole time.

 My mom rushed in once she heard me screaming but he was already gone. It was like he had froze the noise while he was there. She was freaked out but dismissed it. He was young. Maybe teens or in his twenties and had sharp features. He may have been beautiful but I've never felt such fear.

 Side note while I lived there at night sometimes giant roaches would start flying in my room. Like large amounts sometimes 20 or more. I have no idea if it's related but my mom had the house fumigated and it was always only in my room. I have only seen him the one time but have never forgotten and often wondered if anyone else has experienced something similar or seen the same man. Any help would be greatly appreciated."
"Grim Reaper Smelled Me","California","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I travel once in a while for my job. I had flown to California and was back at the hotel after work. 

At about 3am I woke up to the grim reaper standing at the foot of my bed. He was very tall, in a hooded black as night cloak. I could kind of see some shape of a skull underneath the hood. He walked towards me and stopped right about at my waist, then bent over and smelled my body as if I was a roast. I could feel how pleased my scent made him, as if he had been waiting for along time to get his hands on me. That was when I started screaming but it only came out in desperate muffled sobs. He continued to take big deep breaths in while moving up and down my body from my waist to my head, each time raising up after and exhaling out in pleasure. It was horrible. I continued screaming until he just vanished. I felt as if I was close to death that night, and he was there to collect my soul.

 I had taken a prescription benzo that night along with alcohol to fall asleep. I think I almost died from that combo. I was not asleep while that happened, the minute he vanished there was no transition time from being asleep to waking up. I was def awake the whole time. He was not there to pleasantly transition me to the other side either. I felt as if he was the hunter and I was the prey. Yes I've heard of sleep paralysis but this was not it. He was hungry for a soul, and seemed like some are more delicious to him than others. It sounds silly now, but at the time it was horrible. Why he would smell me up and down like that drawing in my essence gives me chills to this day."
"The Ghost Man?","Tennessee","Family / Friends Visits","Hey everyone I am new to your ghosts stories, call me Jaylen. Anyways I'm going to be sharing a story that happened when I was 6years old. I believe 16 or 15 years ago. I don't really remember much but I'll try to write down as much as I can remember.

 This was in the summer of 2004 I believe, It was a sad day because my grandmother's brother died of old age in the hospital. We had his funeral about 3 days later. Also a little thing I realized at the funeral, I saw one of the candles go out on its one a little bit after my great uncle's wife lit it. I've come to believe that the sprit of my great uncle blew it out. Ok but back to the story. After the funeral he got buried a few hours later next to his mother and father who both died of old age as well. (Before I get into the creepy part like to point out that my grandmother as 3 other siblings.) 

About 4 days later I was playing in my room like a normal 6 year old and wanted to get a snack. Here's when things start to take a turn. I was about to go out of the room in until I saw someone! He was a tall man with blonde hair that looked to be a shadow figure but more like a real person. I zoned out for second then realized that it wasn't my imagination. I was about to scream until I heard the man speak in a soft voice ""hello dear"", he said. I was still stunned about what I was seeing, although he seemed nice so I talked to him. About hours of talking the man suddenly disappeared saying ""I have to go"".

About a week of the man showing up he didn't come anymore. Now to this day I still have questions on my mind like was the man the sprit of my great uncle because he looked like him. But I don't think anyone would know.

Ok guys I hope you enjoyed my story.

If you have any questions feel free to ask!"
"Someone Sitting Next To Me","New Jersey","A Haunted Life","I lived alone in a two bedroom mobile home located in the woods. I lived there for about 4 years and nothing ever happened to me. I went to bed one night and I started to feel someone sitting next to me like in the middle but edge of the bed. Nothing was there. Then things started to get worse.

 One night I was sleeping and I woke up to the sound of my TV making scary growling noises and I felt my body crawling on my bedroom ceiling trying to get me out my bedroom door. 

When I came home from work the next evening I ate dinner and laid in my bed and my kitten was laying by my feet and she bounced up and starting looking over my head growling as her head is going in circles, she ran out my bed room door and never came back in my bedroom after that night. She would come as far as my bedroom door and look inside but would not enter. This happened every night to the point were I was exhausted and couldn't function at work no longer.

 I went to work and felt stupid but I told a co-worker whom we will call Ron. He believed me and told me to buy night lights and I did. My home was lit up every night like a X-mas tree. What ever it was just would not go away. Nothing worked!

 I moved out after a year of hell to my new home and things have not changed. I have moved several times and I am still being bothered by something in the middle of the night.

 I do have to say its been not an every night event anymore, now it's more like twice a month. It still scares me and I wish what ever it is that feels the need to bother me would just go away. I can't take anymore!"
"Touches And Things Happening Around Me","Michigan","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I have some concerns about some encounters I've had, so I'm posting here to maybe get suggestions?

Let me tell you a little about me. 

I am a recently turned 16, but have been having things happen to me since I was about 5. I was raised religious, but I'm not all that religious anymore. When I was younger, it was mostly lucid dreams, with me waking up with sleep paralysis. It was fine for a while, until I got older. 

As I got older, I've noticed things only happening around me (Which is odd, because I have a large family). Light flickering and stuff moving (Small stuff). I got use to this, because I didn't really know what to do anyway. Then it moved on to physical touches. Not anything violent, but it wasn't entirely pleasant to me because it freaks me out. It mostly happens at night when I'm about to go to bed. Normally I'd pass it off as my body hair brushing against me, but it feels different than that. It feels very ticklish, almost electric, as if the touches are under my skin rather than on it. Body hair simply feels uncomfortable to me. 

Sometimes it feels comforting and helps me sleep. Other times, I feel a choking-like sensation. Not like something is suffocating me, but like something has its hands around my neck loosely. It's unsettling, but I'm never scared when it happens. All of the above still happens to me, but I haven't had sleep paralysis recently. Just strange touches and lights flickering with stuff moving as of date.

I would go more in depth about the nature of this spirit, but those stories aren't allowed, I'm a minor, and it's incredibly embarrassing. So I won't do that. But any advice? Should I be worried? I'm not exactly worried because it's been happening for nearly half my life, but I want others' opinions. I'm also willing to answer questions if you need more information. 

Thanks for reading!"
"Ghost Mimic Voices","Illinois","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","Early in the year I woke to my son saying MOM in a urgent tone. His room is far enough away so I can only hear if he is inside or by my door. When I got up to see what was wrong, he wasn't there. Checked his room and he was asleep. Mentioned this to my boyfriend ans he just laughed about it and thought I was dreaming or something. 

A couple months ago it happened again, but this time sounded like my younger son, a toddler scream cry. Like he was in distress. Woke up and turned lights on, and he was fast asleep. Checked other son and he was also. Mentioned to boyfriend, but didn't think about it much.

Last month it happened again, I woke to my son saying WHATS THAT. Again checked him and he was asleep. Went back to bed and was woken again to what sounded like a yelling (unsure from who). Checked again everyone asleep. 

Told my boyfriend the next day, again he just thinks I'm dreaming or something.

Last week I was at work and came home. Casually my boyfriend said when he was napping during the day while I was at work he heard me say his name. One thing he said is it sounded urgent, which is something I didn't tell him. 

Been in this house 4 years, never anything until now. 

Thinking of doing some cleansing with sage. Curious of what it could be. Baby is 19 months now, oldest son is 12.

This has happened once before when oldest was a year or two. Heard what we (ex boyfriend) thought was my son crying. He was in another town that night with sister. That time I saw a black figure by bed. Rolled over and attempted to sleep once it faded."
"3 Horned Bull Headed Man With Horse Legs","South Carolina","Haunted Places","I have always felt the presence of spirits, they often come to me as a dream like vision while I'm awake but almost asleep. In my youth I got flashes of scary gory horrifying imagery then I would feel a presence. I learned to communicate with mental imagery and found if I allowed the spirits to pass through me they could finally rest. It's been many years since I've tried to communicate.

 In the last 4 or so years I've had a new experience with visions becoming more than a flash of a dead body or decapitated bloody car wrecks. I started feeling a very heavy negative energy around me at home. Like I'm being watched. It's strongest just before bed. This entity isn't interested in communicating or trying to get my attention to pass on. It feels content to stay and lurk around me in my bedroom.

 One night a vision came to me unlike any other; a goat head with horns and woman's chest with goat legs. After some research I discovered Baphomet, this was an image I'd seen before but it scared me so much before I put it out of my mind. Eventually I performed a sage rubbing, read aloud from my Bible the Lord is my Shepard... I lit a white candle fanned the smoke and made ash crosses above the doors. I tried imagery of me cutting the head off this beast with a sword. Since I've gotten a new vision a 3 horned bulls head man's upper body and lower legs like a hooved animal. Visions of a cliff with grey naked bodies holding onto each other pulling each other down. I feel worried, scared and nervous. This entity won't leave and I'm scared. Any thoughts,advice?"
"Objects That Move, Disappear And Reappear","Alaska","A Haunted Life","It was 11:00PM and I was home alone. A grown man, who has had several paranormal encounters, I don't scare easy. 

It's a normal occurrence for household items to disappear and later reappear. It's also normal for lights to flicker around me, regardless of where I go. 

I'm living in a home where the previous owner died of cancer in the house. Neighbors told me the old woman spent all her time gardening outside; but as cancer took its toll, the weeds gained ground amidst the flowers and things that needed to be done didn't get done. I smudged the house with sage and placed salt across window sills and doors. I also explained out loud, as well as telepathically, that she had passed away and that I had purchased the home and would take good care of it. 

Before moving in, I repainted the interior of the home and I had the old carpet and padding pulled out and I replaced it with new padding and carpet. I also remodeled my bathrooms and built a hearth for my living room fireplace. I made many more improvements to the interior of the home, so much so that it was obvious I was taking good care of the home. The ghost of the previous owner should see that and leave me alone, right? 

Despite this, I heard sounds in my attic, like someone walking over rafters above, quietly murmuring to someone or something else. It was common place for me to experience cold spots in the house, especially my own bedroom. I was also used to smelling rotten smells now and then, without any logical reason, so I assumed I must have passed the gas without realizing it. It was likewise normal for me to lie in bed and feel the mattress compressing at the foot of the bed, and feel the slow denting of footsteps on the bed coming closer to me. I was used to being tormented in my sleep (the subject of another article perhaps). Whether it was the previous owner or someone or something else, I know not.

What I can tell you is that as I was lying on my couch, alone at night, one of my dvd racks, which was fully loaded with dvds, toppled over. It was four feet high and two feet wide, weighing at least 20 pounds. Only by applying force to the dvd rack could it topple over. Yet it did. Why? Who?

This is what terrified me. Why? Who? Something invisible to me knocked over my dvd rack and made a mess. Why? To illustrate it had the power to do so, at any time. Why? To terrify me. To let me know that I am not alone and I am powerless against it. 

At the time, I was living a life of sin, with the worst sins imaginable being part of my past. I could not simply pray to God for help. I needed to have my spiritual filth scrubbed off of me before I could even pray to God for help. I resolved to 1) Get married, so that I wouldn't be fornicating, and 2) Get baptized, to cleanse me of my past sins in order for my prayers to be heard when I asked for help.

I contacted a psychic to cleanse my house. She came to my house, walked around it, before asking me for a ladder to get into my attic. She looked like she was mustering all of her courage as I fetched the ladder. She went up and I waited with my wife in the living room. When she returned, she said that I must have had some serious protection during my life, because this thing attached itself to me in my childhood and brought about misery, depression, and evil in my life. The psychic said it was gone now, but that this could be only the beginning. I paid her $200 for her service. 

To be on the safe side, I contacted a different psychic, a man. The man did not charge me anything to cleanse my house. But he asked me many questions about my life and personality in order to get a feel for who I am. Afterwards, he told me that my soul - or my spiritual aura - was really, really dark. Darker than anyone else he'd ever seen. I told him nothing about my past that would lead him to draw that conclusion. But I knew he was right, and only someone with spiritual insight could know it. He said he cleared my home and my aura of the darkness. 

Between both psychics, the problems at my home stopped. 

At work, however, another object moved. A nitrogen bottle, fully charged, weighing 30 to 40 pounds, had been sitting upright on a steel welding table. There were others in the room but nobody close to the nitrogen bottle. All of a sudden, this steel bottle tipped over and began rolling towards the edge of the table. Had it of fallen and the bottle head became damaged, it would have turned the bottle into a missile and potentially killed someone. Seeing the bottle tip over, I ran towards it and stopped it from rolling off the table. Again, it took force, considerable force, to tip that steel bottle over. The table was perfectly level.

There were strange happenings in my former home, the home from which I fled, and as a result found the home I'm living in now. At this former home, my roommate asked me if my girlfriend (now my wife) was into any weird or dark religious practices. I asked him why he asked and he told me that things changed once she moved in. That his own wife, and their kids, hear things in the home, specifically a whistle whenever the girls used the upstairs shower. I said maybe it's water pipes. He said it was the kind of whistle that sounded like a boy getting a girl's attention, and it only happened when the girls took a shower, just the girls. Downstairs, he said the family would be watching TV when the dogs (a pack of Pitbulls) all looked up toward the ceiling, with their hackles raised, and they growled deep. The dogs did this with another hot spot: the pantry closet. While the family watched TV, sometimes the lights would turn off or on, and sometimes the TV would turn off by itself. 

I told my roommate that my wife wasn't a witch or a devil worshipper, that she was a sweet, kind, caring person. However, I explained to my roommate that I have been noticing lights flicker, and that I found a bat in my room one morning. But the worst thing I observed was a giant toolbox, resting upon a dog kennel, full of heavy tools (the toolbox had to of weighed 50 pounds), lift off of the dog kennel and then get thrown inside the kennel. It was LOUD. At home it was just me and one of the kids. She was on the front porch and heard the slam, asking me what had just happened. I told her exactly what I saw and what I heard, as well as tell my roommate, when we were discussing the paranormal events in the home. 

Then I remembered a few other events and reminded my roommate about them. We had two entrances to the home. A side door and a front door. Each door connected to the kitchen downstairs. One day my roommate and I took a drive someplace, and when we returned, one of the dogs was outside of the house. How did he get out of his kennel AND how did he get out of the house? The front door was closed and locked. The side door, however, was laying down on the ground outside. Not just the door: but the door jam too. Something kicked this door so hard that it broke lose the door jam from the house itself. Now, that door jam had been nailed into place. Only a tremendous amount of force could have blown out that door. 

The dog that was let loose from his kennel was the size of a great Dane dog. A MASSIVE dog, one that I personally saw mauling a 350 pound pig like it was breakfast. Nobody in their right mind, no intruder, no burglar, would have unlocked that dog's kennel and risk the certainty of being mauled. Furthermore, I found my own dog's kennel door was unlocked and open. But my dog, a male Pitbull and a sweetheart to other dogs but a biter of people, was laying in the safety of his kennel. Why? Because the bigger male Pitbull, that we found outside, had a bad habit of mauling my dog, as well as other male Pitbulls in the house. By unlocking and opening my dog's kennel, along with the bigger male's kennel, the thing responsible for doing this was trying to ensure that my dog got mauled by the monster male. It was a deliberate act. No human being would have done so, because my dog consistently attacked strangers. And again, the monster sized Pitbull was of such a size that only a madman would have let him loose, while being in the house with the dogs. Letting them both loose at the same time was an evil attempt to get my dog hurt or killed. The larger Pitbull had sent my dog to the vet for stitches more than once, as well as another of the males. In fact, it was because of this Pitbull's violence that all of the dogs were left in their kennels and only certain dogs were allowed out of their kennels at the same time. I swear to God, whatever thing opened each kennel door was EVIL, knowing what would happen. My own dog was so terrorized by the monster male that he shook in fear when around him. Again, about the kitchen's side door, how much force would it take to boot out the door - and the door jam - from the side of the house, leaving the door on the ground? A lot of force! It was an exterior door too, so it was as heavy as it was stout. 

Oh, there was one other door to the house. It was upstairs in my roommate's room. It led to a small deck. On a few occasions, I discovered, upon returning home, that this door was open when it was always left closed. Who or what opened that door more than once? 

About me. I was exposed to domestic violence as a child and subjected to child abuse for years. I grew up with hatred in my heart. I prayed to the devil as a child, to kill or otherwise ruin them for what they did to me. And I would communicate with something dark and evil, toward that end, telepathically. The cost of revenge was my soul. Since we are talking about eternal hell, I never gave up my own soul. But I asked about giving the devil the souls of other people instead. This, I never knowingly did. Just exploring options. In that house, my step sister's infant daughter died of SIDS and the baby's mother complained to me twice of seeing ""someone"" in the house. When I searched the whole house, I found nobody. She said it was a dark figure and she didn't get a good enough glimpse at him to describe his details. He was seen walking into the bathroom from the hallway. Two times, she saw shadow people in that house. When she turned 16, she moved out to go live with her uncle, saying there was too much tension and evil in that house. At the time, I assumed she saw a human intruder, who must have escaped through the bathroom window. She was terrified! 

When I turned 13, and found myself committed to a child psychiatric hospital, I began playing games like Light As A Feather Stiff As A Board, and I also played with Ouija boards. I read books on witchcraft spells and continued telepathically communicating with something evil. It was not a scary evil to me. At the time, I think it was passing itself off as a friendly spirit in order to fool me, because it later showed its true face when I was 15. 

It attacked me in my sleep. Again, my nocturnal attacks are the subject of another posting. It reminded me that we had a deal and I hadn't fulfilled my end of the bargain. In response, I said ""You aren't real! Your just my own mind talking back to me."" It asked me how to prove its existence to me. I replied by suggesting that it tell my friends to talk to me, saying they had been contacted by demons, and they just wanted to prove they are real.

 I joke you not. That week, I was at school when I got a call from the dean's office ordering me to come down to the office. When I went to his office, he explained that one of his students is crying and screaming and hysterical, saying that she was being tormented by demons and that she should contact me, as I was the only one who could help her. The girl's name was Nicole and I never saw her again. I told the dean to tell her to pray to Jesus Christ, ask him to forgive her sins, and then ask God to make the demons go away. The dean would not allow me to see her. I think he was startled by my response, since I had long hair, and wore a jean jacket with an ACDC patch on the back that said Highway to Hell. I listened to Slayer, King Diamond, Merciful Fate, Metallica and other newly emerging death metal music during the 80's. So they proved they are real. And after that, they began tormenting me in my sleep. Again, another future article. 

Without going into details about my sleep torment, I'll just say I experienced reoccurring nightmares, sleep paralysis, horrible dreams about demonic possession. 

There is more I can say on topic but it might best be posted in different sections. Thanks for reading about my experiences. Today, I am a Christian, baptized, and I don't communicate with evil entities. I am a loner Christian, and I pray silently whenever I do pray."
"That Time I Was Low-key Possessed","Virginia","Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms","Life has been hectic enough over the last few months to have kept me away from the YGS community for far too long - but, as it usually does, an experience has occurred and sent me running back to you! I'm not exactly certain what category this experience should be slotted into as it's a little bit spiritual, a little bit ghostly, a little bit personal growth... A little bit ""who knows""! That said, I am going to write this as it occurred chronologically - meaning the recounting has the benefit of hindsight that I, of course, lacked as I experienced it in real time.

The whole thing began on Wednesday, June 16. Once every year, I take a particular form of hallucinogenic substance that has been shown to have a positive impact on depression. I'm not here to justify or promote the taking of any substance. The experience isn't a physically pleasant one nor is it emotionally a walk in the park - it makes you really take a hard introspective look at yourself and that can be difficult. I believe it puts me a bit more in touch with the other side as well - in previous experiences, my grandparents have come through quite clearly.

 This time was different than last year's session as it had already been a hectic few weeks and I was rushed as I was about to leave town for work and wanted to do this first - so, I shied away from taking the really deep dive emotionally as I just didn't have the ""umph"" in me to handle something so intense. At the end of the day, I was left feeling ""off"" - like a picture hanging crooked. 

Hindsight: By ingesting said substance, I made myself visible to whatever energies were floating around my home at the time and one particularly negative energy/entity in particular - furthermore, I showed weakness by shying away from the hard stuff. I still had the positive shield, guides, and energies that normally surround me in place, however, so all ""it"" could do was hover like a dark clouds over a cook-out...menacing but harmless. 

I left town at the end of the week (Friday, June 18th). I work as a freelance model so being able to be ""in the moment"" and creative on your feet is very important - and the entire time, I still felt ""off,"" blocked, off kilter. As the trip drew to a close by June 30th, I pulled up to my second to last shoot of almost twenty. I was tired and road-weary but was feeling that final burst of energy like a horse with its head pointed towards the stable. During the shoot, we were using lasers. Hoping to make the beams show up in the photographs, the photographer wanted to put smoke into the air - to do so, he used a white sage smudging stick. I instantly felt like it was a bad idea but, foolishly, allowed it to go ahead anyway. By the time we were done, the basement where we were shooting was thick with smoke. 

Hindsight: I was effectively smudged without intent - the process weakened my natural defenses, opened the door for whatever might be hanging about and that baddie that had been dogging me since June 16th waltzed right in. 

This is where things begin going down hill with frightening speed. Every day for the next nine days, something negative would happen. 

Thursday, July 1st: Everything possible got in my way as I was trying to get home from the trip making a 3 hour drive into an 8.5 hour journey. I was also a bit sick during the drive and received some troubling news from my doctor about my own health (without getting into detail, issues regarding uniquely female parts of the body) when I, at length, got home.

Friday, July 2nd: I totaled my beloved car of 16 years while parallel parking (talk about freak accidents - who totals a car while PARKING?). 

Saturday, July 3rd: One of our collectible vintage glasses exploded in my hand.

Sunday, July 4th: One of our three cats -the youngest, our only boy, Little Mann- became deathly ill with a sudden upper respiratory infection.

Monday, July 5th: Our little boy's infection grew so bad that he could not breathe and was gagging, we spent the entire day in and out of vets trying to find someone who could help him. Finally, we did but the solution came with the diagnosis of feline herpes, which will potentially bother him for the rest of his life and could spread to the other two. The whole thing boggles me because they are all exclusively indoor cats, they get the best food, filtered water, they've all be vaccinated against the virus, have no contact with other animals and both my husband and I are meticulous about washing our hands before we touch them, taking off our shoes and changing our clothes as soon as we get home. 

Tuesday, July 6th: I had a wicked migraine and our little boy nearly aspirated his medication.

Wednesday, July 7th: I got a parking ticket.

Thursday, July 8th: My hand got caught in a vintage electric fan with metal blades that was on high at the time. My right thumb was nearly cut in half vertically and I passed out in front of my horrified 9 year old nieces in a dramatic spray of blood. 

Friday, July 9th:...I was too afraid to leave the house for fear of what might happen. I was effectively this thing's prisoner. There was no way I was going to put my nieces into the car with me - I just knew something horrific would happen.

During this entire period, my cats were behaving strangely - Little Mann (a male tux less than a year old - usually healthy as a horse and a little jester), of course, was ill, Chablis (all black with one white spot, female, 4 years - usually cautious and reclusive around strangers but otherwise very engaged, submissive and very sweet) was very anxious, hid most of the time and was ""verbally"" aggressive to Little Mann, and Vera (female tux, 4 years - the smallest but the dominate cat and my ""familiar"") was very clingy and constantly in my face, clearly concerned.

Friday evening, my husband spoke to one of our neighbors, Em, who is our resident go-to-gal for all things spiritual. She is a sensitive and very ""in tune."" He explained what had been going on and she said she would come up and help me out. I sent the nieces out to catch fire flies with my husband, and Em and I got started. As soon as she walked in, she could sense something violently ""off"" both about me and in our home. As she walked around the flat, she sensed that it was the strongest in areas where we have no images of or artifacts from our family displayed. Items that I had brought home from the trip (I always thrift as I go) had particularly strong negativity around them. She explained that it wasn't so much that the items I brought home had anything attached to them (a relief since virtually everything in my home from the dishes to my clothes is at least second hand... If not third or fourth) as that the negative energy/entity that was attached to me was behaving like an animal scent-marking its territory - the things that happened to have been with me on any leg of the journey, of course, were the first things that were available for ""it"" to ""mark."" 

This energy/entity had been alerted to me when I ingested the hallucinogen - I was already weak at my sacral chakra - when I was smudged without intention, the weakness, my own doubt about the situation all combined to leave me wide open and this thing slipped right in - it then went to work trying to control and dominate me by attacking me at my core (my health, my ""kids"" [ie the cats], my beloved car) and isolating me from the world (once again, the car and damaging my right hand... Let me tell you, you really need the thumb on your dominate hand to do just about everything, the intense fear). As animals sense this sort of thing more keenly than humans and black cats are oft believed to have the ability to dispel ""evil spirits"" - that explained their odd behavior, this thing was too much for them to handle. She performed a ritual of her own and then we smudged the whole place with Paolo Santo - during the entire process, Vera sat on the dining room table watching in complete calm as though she knew what Em was doing. 

Once Em was done, the entire place felt... Less crowded, like the air weighed less - even I felt lighter, the fear and foreboding were gone - ""it"" was gone. It is now Sunday the 11th of July and nothing further has happened. Little Mann is making a full recovery. 

Incidentally, while she was here, Em confirmed some of our suspicions about our resident spirits. She sensed our man in the corner of the bedroom and a female energy who moves throughout the home spending most of her time in the guest room (where my nieces sleep on their visits) and the kitchen. She also noticed quite distinctly that my bathroom has NO activity whatsoever - so the ""no shower stuff"" portion of my ""Paranormal House Rules"" seems to be observed!:-D"
"Man Of The House","Florida","Haunted Places","I'm not sure if this is a love story or a ghost story. I have always been clairvoyant and have experienced odd things but nothing like this, and I haven't experienced it again.

 I was in the fifth grade and my family moved to a ranch home in Gainesville built after the World War by a couple who had moved from Germany. The elderly woman who owned the home would not sell it to the fraternities or young people. It was the home she and her husband built to raise their family and live their life. But she decided my family should own it, so it was sold. It was a perfect location right down the street from the Ben Hill Griffin Gator Stadium and next to my school. However it came with something, or someone else. 

It began with loud banging, like someone was jumping above my ceiling or dropping a 100lb box. It wasn't animals, it was much to big, and we had nothing in the attic. Then the knobs that were original would stop working, locking me into my bedroom and I would have to manually take apart the knob to get out. However, none of my other family experienced this. Then things would disappear and reappear in places I would never put them. Like my phone being hidden in a random chest in my room. There would be footsteps, however no one was home except me. Then I saw him, clear as day.

I was walking into the hallway where there were three thresholds, one to the living room, kitchen, and office. As I walked a transparent man over 6 feet tall walked from the kitchen into the office. For a moment I thought it was my father, only to look up and see him sitting on the couch. It was enough to make me drop what I had in my hands. 

I was scared at first, but I could feel what this man wanted. This was his home, where he had his life. Luckily, he was not an evil poltergeist. I think at first he wanted us out of his home but I began ignoring him. The lesser mind I paid to him the more his actions dwindled. I still think about him from time to time. He was a powerful spirit but only because I know he was so connected to that home and for the right reasons. He may have seen my family falling apart behind the scenes and been trying to warn, who knows. But what I do know is he was a man who loved his home, and his wife still loved him enough to want to try her best to place it in good hands."
"A Night Visit From My Father After His Death","Tennessee","Family / Friends Visits","My father had lived with my wife and me for several years before his death and we had enjoyed his travels with us to the old farm where I grew up as we now lived in the city.

 A year or so after his death I had a visit from him in my mind which although 20 years ago is as fresh and clear as if it happened last night. It was not a dream! I have had dreams and am unable to remember or experience any of them as I have this one of my mind.

 I heard the door bell ring and got out of bed to go answer the door. When I opened it, my father stood outside. He was in white clothes with a light around him and he had his little horn rimmed glasses on. I invited him in and we went into the study and sat around the fireplace and visited. We had a very friendly conversation and soon he told me that he must go.

I led him to the front door and turned to open it when he just walked through the door and was gone. I have shared this story with friends who have had similar mind experiences with a son who had died, and very recently my wife told me that her sister had shared a visit by her teen aged son who had shot himself some years ago. We are told that we are mind, body, and soul. Yet we have studied the body in medical research, but neglected the mind.

It was once thought that the brain controlled the mind, but we now know that this is not true for people who were brain dead have shared their experiences during the time before being resuscitated. See the book by Elizabeth Kubler Ross and another to be published soon by a man who has studied such events of the mind over the past 40 years. Now doctors are attempting to explain the mind. What is it? There is much still to be learned about us human creatures created by God."
"Mouse Apparition Pushing A Protective Shield","Idaho","Pets / Animals","This story is from our current home that we purchased September 2020. This home was built in the early 1990s; it's partially remodeled. It has newer fake wood floors that look good, but they SNAP and CRACK all the time, day and night because they were installed improperly. The first couple of weeks the floor and house noises would wake myself and our Yorkie, as my head is 2 feet from bedroom door opening, where the wood floor stops and carpet begins. We have plug-in nightlights and I would get up and look around, but realized they were just house noises.

November 2020 - Having found the YGS site, I was up early typing one of my visitations, with my back to the small dining room and kitchen opening, and I heard an odd noise coming from the kitchen (at my back). I got up and moved to the left-hand side of the couch so I could see the kitchen entry. My wife said with her new grandbaby coming, she hoped I wasn't going to be bringing spirit activity into our new home by bringing up all of these past experiences. So, I was a little on edge about the noise in the kitchen, and heard what I thought was a metal clanking sound. 

 I stood and slowly walked into the kitchen. This entrance is the farthest from the sink and fridge area. I followed the sound to the sink - some dishes are in the sink and I moved some around and found nothing. The next morning, I looked under the sink to find two holes in the cabinet floor and droppings (MICE!) I had some snap traps from our last home and placed one trap under the sink. I trapped two mice in one week. The wife sent me out for steel wool to put in the holes. All is well and I'm not worried about mice getting back under the sink.

 Many days passed, and I was laying awake early a.m. In bed and heard a new noise echoing along the wood floors. I finally got up and snuck (kind of) into the living room and realized the noise was in the kitchen. This is the large entrance into the kitchen, closer to the sink, refrigerator and back door (all windows area). Took a light step into the kitchen and the noise was radiating from the sink area. Standing there, I realized a mouse was dragging a tooth and is trying to chew a new hole into the bottom of the cabinet floor to get into sink area. I opened the cabinet door, yelled a couple of cuss words at it, and slammed the cabinet door shut. It stopped chewing (haha!) The next morning, I pulled the steel wool, set a trap and got the mouse the same day. I took a good look at this poor little guy in the trap, and noticed how beautiful the little creature was. I replaced the steel wool and left the traps, just in case. 

I believe it was some time after Thanksgiving, one beautiful morning around 10:30a.m., just cleaning up after making Omelets for breakfast. I was in the kitchen and all the drapes at our back wall were open (many windows), so daylight is sparkling off our syrup brown flooring. The kitchen entrance here is tight, between refrigerator wall and dishwasher, with a 4' angled opening. We left our old fridge when we sold, and had to wait for new one. In the meantime, a neighbor had loaned us an old one that leaked and we kept in the garage. I was standing where our fridge should have been and had food in both hands to return to the fridge in the garage, and I heard my wife's footsteps coming towards me from my left and cannot see her through the wall. I was facing the angled opening and looking down for wife's reflection or feet so we don't collide at the opening. Maybe 4 feet in front of me, I saw a black V (like an arrowhead) materialize. It was black and a half inch thick and about 1 1/2 inches tall and the point of the V is coming straight at me. It was slightly billowing and had kind of a hop to it. Not really thinking, and more in awe of it, it was over 18"" wide at the back, this V is coming at me. I continued to look down and it was almost 1 foot in front of me, and I saw a mouse as black as the V ribbon it was pushing. It's nose is the point of the V, and the protective ribbon was hugging its cheeks, front legs, and back legs. I saw it's front shoulders moving, and hips moving, and its long tail was moving from side to side of the V. This little critter is scurrying across the floor towards me, looking like it was alive, and runs and disappears at my feet. This was maybe a 4 second encounter.

 My wife came around the corner, and I asked, ""DID YOU JUST SEE THAT?!"" She said no, she wasn't looking down. I told her I thought she spooked it and made it run. If I hadn't been looking down, I would have missed this crossing. A spirit mouse pushing a protective shield - what an amazing sight. 

I have since bought a live trap and can walk them to a nearby park to let them go now. In late December, my wife told me that the mice had gotten into our cabinet with the lazy Susan. Mostly bulk stuff on these shelves, and the mouse had gotten into a bag of rice at the back and we threw it away. Pulled everything out and cleaned the cabinet with bleach. Found our old salt and pepper shakers, and lo and behold they were a man and woman mouse dressed in 1600s hat and clothing - very cute. They're back on the counter now as a reminder. 

As of this writing, no more mice found in our house. But I am constantly looking at the floor now. Many of my sightings have been after eating breakfast. It seems I'm at the right vibration when I am fat and happy. I am now current with all of my visitations. Thanks for reading. Good luck out there. (typed and edited by wife)"
"The House On The Corner","California","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","My sister and I went to walk our little dog around the block. There are 6 houses on our side of the street, ours being the second one from the corner of Maclay and Gladstone. We exited our home and as we walked up the driveway (there is an incline out our front door to the sidewalk), I turned to my right and saw clear across the front yards of the 3 closest neighbors, clear to the last house on the corner.

I could see that somebody was watering the front yard of the house on the corner of Gladstone and Macneil. I could see that it was a woman watering her yard, she was wearing what appeared to be a robe. It was an older woman. She had completely gray hair, a little on the poofy side, you know, I could kind of see ""through"" it. Anyway, I could see her holding the water hose and I could see the stream of water coming from it, out to the sidewalk. 

I told my sister, ""The sidewalk is going to be wet."" My sister later told me she thought, ""Wet?""

There are approximately 60 - 70 steps to the corner house, not much, and as we approached that very area, nothing! No wet sidewalk, no water hose, nobody watering the lawn. I was dumbfounded. 

I told my sister, ""Hey! I just saw somebody watering this front lawn! That's why I told you the sidewalk would be wet!"" My sister didn't see anything and most certainly didn't believe me. She had just wondered why I had said that the sidewalk would be wet. I never saw it again.

I've seen the woman who lived in that house (still does, to the best of my knowledge). I've seen her several times, in fact, wearing a house coat or robe. I know I had seen what I had seen, and yet...? What was that about?"
"Numerous Happenings","South Carolina","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","This is just a compilation of small things either I or family have experienced. I've decided to do this because, even though they are individual incidents, they are too small or I just don't have enough info to write into a story and still meet the minimum character limit. Each paragraph is its own story.

This first one happened when my family went on vacation to the Cherokee reservation in North Carolina. We've gone many times (it's more like a second home than a vacation spot) so I can't recall what year it was. All I remember is I wasn't a teen yet. We normally stay in a cabin but this time they were all booked so we stayed in the Super 8 hotel. It was early morning and my dad had gone down to the lobby to get breakfast. My mom was laying down watching the news when she heard a man clear his throat then felt and heard the bed move as if someone was getting up.

This one happened to my big sister. In 2007, one of my dad's friends had just died from a heart attack and so we went to be with his family for a little while. My sister decided to stay home. She told us when we got back that she had looked outside and saw a figure walking across the field that is by our house, then saw it disappear right before it reached the wood line.

Next is something my grandfather told us back in 2009. It was around 2am when he and my grandmother were jolted awake by the slamming of a door in their house. He got up and grabbed his shot gun to inspect. He checked every door and window in the house only to find everything as it should be. 

One night I was taking out the trash when I looked to my left and saw one of our cats run from the walnut tree to the house only to disappear halfway. The thing is, that cat had died a year prior. I even saw her run into my parents' room on a different occasion and my sister and I have heard her distinctive meow once years later.

This last one my mom, dad, and sister have seen multiple times. They describe it as the shadow of a tall man wearing a long coat and top hat. He's always seen standing outside my parents' room. Just recently I learned of other people seeing a figure they call ""The Hat Man"". It's seen as being a bad omen to which I can say every time someone in my family has seen him, a loved one has died a few days later. My mom has seen him twice. The first time her dad died, and then her mom. When my dad saw him, his friend had that massive heart attack. When my sister saw him, our paternal grandfather didn't die, but had a severe stroke. It really gives me chills knowing that this isn't just something my family has seen."
"Gliding White Entity","South Carolina","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","This one happened one night in 2010. Me, my mom and older brother (who had recently moved back in because his girlfriend kicked him out) were sitting in the living room.

I believe it was somewhere between 10:00/10:30. We had one of the windows open because it was early autumn and the air outside was nice. I was sitting in a chair by the piano looking at the TV, which is in a corner with the window right next to it. This is how I saw the apparition. 

Anyway, I was watching TV and suddenly something white and sort of illuminated glides by the window from right to left, in the direction of our back door. Thinking it was my mom, I didn't give it much thought. Until I realized my mom was sitting in the recliner next to me, and my brother was still on the couch. All of this processed with in about 2 seconds and so, in realizing this, I jump up and grab the baseball bat we kept next to the back door and run out to investigate. 

I walked around the entire house, checking high and low only to find nothing. Keep in mind the area around the window and back door is very open and in the time of seeing it and going out, there's no way someone could have ran and hid without me at least hearing them.

Funny enough, once I go back inside, instantly my brother asked me, ""Didn't find nothin', did ya?"". He said this more matter of factly, than an actual question. 

Come to find out he saw it too, but didn't say anything because at this point he'd been staying there about 3 weeks and had seen it twice before and had done the same thing I did.

Two nights later around the same time, I was in the kitchen making mac n' cheese when I saw it again. Only this time it was IN the house. Our stove sits right next to the doorway going into the living room and as I stood there stirring the noodles, I glanced up and saw that same figure go gliding once again from right to left, in the direction of the back door. 

My little sister was curled up in the same chair that I had been in two nights prior. I walked in and decided not to say anything about it, I instead asked, ""Why'd you just walk to the back door?""

She looked at me, eyes wide, and goes, ""You saw that too?"" Still not letting on that I knew it wasn't her I simply said, ""Stop acting like it wasn't you."" She then got upset and promised me that it wasn't her. I asked her what it looked like. She then described the exact same thing I'd seen. 

I know it was mean to accuse her even when I knew it wasn't, but I wanted to be absolutely sure. After talking about it, we both agreed that the figure felt like a woman and meant no harm.

Later on, I learned from my brother that when he was living with his girlfriend of the time, they had seen that figure in their home. We believe that it may have followed him when he moved out."
"Ears Ringing And Seatbelt Malfunction?","Georgia","Misc","I admit the two things in the title don't really go together, though they happened within a day of each other. 

This morning I left early to go to the doctor. Traffic was good at just before 7am, and as I passed the commercial node in my neighborhood, driving my five year old Toyota Mom van with very low mileage, the two lane road ahead was clear. I accelerated and was thinking about my day, when suddenly the seat belt mechanism was somehow triggered and my belt tightened up as though I was about to crash. It truly scared me and that fight or flight stuff kicked in. I slowed down, looked all around, checked my rear view mirror... It was inexplicable. I remember thinking, maybe I actually hit something but was still in that moment before the realization SET IN. But... Nothing. I was driving clear, the seatbelt loosened on its own and I kept on driving. 

Almost immediately, I realized I was at or very near the spot where a young, local woman teacher (in her 20s) was tragically killed a couple years ago when a carload of young kids coming the other direction at a high rate of speed crossed the center line and hit her head on. We are talking about a busy suburban area just beyond a Waffle House and in front of a subdivision where there's a third (turn) lane, so the road is wide and straight. It's about a half a block up from my Publix grocery store (where things like to jump off the shelves in front of me). The day the young lady was killed, my daughters and I had gone to the store and could see the ambulance lights just far enough away that we could not make out details. But I knew someone had died. It was 4pm, and when we came out of the store after grabbing a couple things, everything was weirdly quiet for me, the sky was BRIGHT sunny blue, just vibrant. 

I wonder if anyone else sees things in a vibrant way when they have an ""experience?"" I'm starting to recognize this feeling, not even sure yet what to call it (not really a feeling, but a heightened awareness, a quietness, sometimes it's felt heavy but on this day I thought it was light and bright is the word I want (remember how all the descriptions of 9-11-01 talk about the ""bright blue sky?"" Kind of like that).

There were pictures posted later on people's Facebook pages of a rainbow... I have not forgotten the young lady or her family (who are from our area) but this morning I wasn't thinking of her at all... 

Later this afternoon, I told my teenage son about the seatbelt thing, learning moment, as he's learning to drive. Today though, his eyes got really wide and he says, ""But Mom, there was also a kid from my school who was killed walking home from the Waffle House there a few weeks ago! He was hit on his scooter!"" So in that vicinity, within probably 300 feet of each other, two young people have been killed recently. And this is where my seatbelt ""malfunctioned."" Even though my car is in great shape and it has only ever tightened like that when I have stomped on the brakes. 

Does anyone have thoughts on this? I'm trying not to create my own narrative and trying to stay open. 

At the same time, I was wondering what you all might know about ears ringing? I have NEVER had ringing in my ears before, but feel like I've read or seen maybe on tv that some people get a ringing during a ghost hunt. I was working at my computer on something I believe my Mom could've really helped me on (she died in 2013) and my ears sort of went crazy ringing. I thought of her, but I also thought ""oh no, maybe I have covid, is that a symptom?!"" I think I'm fine, but it's just been one of those years, right? Thanks for any comments. Mrs. R.

 PS, Just as I'm finishing up with this, I decided to take a video in my family room to capture the loud music from the swim meet out back. As I'm taking the video, I can see orbs on my phone screen, one in particular that forms up amazingly bright though I cannot see it with my eyes only on the camera. Great, never captured that before. And my ears were ringing."
"A Dark Entity","South Carolina","Haunted Places","The story is purely a second hand account.

It happened to my older sister in 2011 while she was home alone. I know it being the events as she tells them and not my own personal experience, one can question it's validity even more so. But my sister isn't the type to tell ghost stories and the way I found out only gives it more truth to me. 

It happened on a Saturday night. I even know the exact time for a reason you'll see shortly.

It starts when me, my little brother and our dad had gone to a dirt track race at Sumter Speedway. We were there supporting a family friend who was making his dirt track debut in a super late model. My sister had stayed home because racing isn't really her thing. My mom and dad had been going through a tough time and so my mom wasn't staying with us at that moment.

Anyway, we were waiting for the final race of the night to start, the late model A-main, of which our friend had been able to qualify for. The race had to start late because of issues with the clay becoming to dry. 

As we were waiting for the officials to get the track back to race conditions, my dad's phone rings. It was my sister asking where we were. My dad doesn't really know how to respond. He just says, ""we're at... The track?"" in a confused questioning voice. 

My sister says ""Y'all need to get home""

Dad, ""Why, what happened?""

Sis, ""I just don't want to be here alone.""

My dad assures her that the last race is about to start and then we'll be there in about an hour or so. This is when I pull out my phone to see the time, 11:10pm

So the race ends, we chat with our friend and then head home.

When we walk inside, my sister has every light in the house on and is clearly relieved we're there. She then tells me what happened. She was in her room video chatting with her boyfriend when she not only heard her door start to slowly open but saw the knob turn. It stopped slightly open then slowly began to open about half way. My sister called out ""dad?"" Then my name. About 5 seconds after she called out, the door forcefully slammed shut. She jumps up believing I'm messing with her, only to find we were still gone and she's still there alone. Her boyfriend (who isn't a strong believer) even saw it happen on the web cam.

It didn't just end with my sister either. My dad told us that as he walked in, he saw my sister standing in the kitchen, only to have her disappear when he looked fully at her.

Some people have asked, ""well if she was so scared, then why didn't her boyfriend come over to comfort her?""

Well, he would have... Had he not been living in Wisconsin at the time. We live in SC.

On a happier note, our friend placed 3rd that night and went on to place 2nd in season standings!"
"Witch's Cackle?","South Carolina","Haunted Places","As I stated in my first story ""Voice On Tape"", I was going to ask my mom if I could share some of her stories. I asked and she agreed.

This happened to my mom and half sister before I was born. First off, in order to understand just how horrifying this was, I'll have to give a little detail of the land my family has. We live on 85 acres of land. That's just my side of the family. The whole tract of land is divided among other branches of family. In total, there's about 160 acres that we have access to. 

My grandparents lived next door and had built a playhouse in their backyard for the grandkids.

It was one night my mom and sister were home by themselves. My sister had a friend over and they asked if they could go play in the playhouse. They were about 13 at the time so my mom said it was fine. 

Some time later, my mom guesses around 8:30ish, she was sitting in the living room and out of no where there was this loud god awful laughing. The best way she can describe it is to imagine the most evil witch's cackle you can imagine and times that by three. She said it sounded like it was in the room with her. 

The next thing she knew she hears my sister and her friend screaming at the top of their lungs and in they barged, faces pale and scared. Asking them what's wrong they proceed to tell her that they were in the playhouse and suddenly they heard this evil laughing inside with them.

This is where describing the land is important. The playhouse is about 50 yards from my parents house, so how could both my mom and my sister and friend have heard the laughter as if it were in the same rooms as them, when they were so far apart?

To this day mom doesn't like telling the story but she will. It's been 32 years and neither my mom or sister have changed the story in the slightest. The conviction when they tell is also still very strong.

I'd also like to point out that it's been confirmed that the Congaree Natives in fact lived on that land. We've found arrow heads and pottery shards in the woods as well. So it makes you wonder, is that the reason behind all the paranormal stuff that happens at my parents house?"
"The Radio","South Carolina","Haunted Places","I was 17 and sitting alone in the living room watching Tv. It was about 11:30 at night. Everyone else had already gone to bed. I've always been a night owl, so it wasn't uncommon for me. I had a habit of sitting in the living room with the Tv on while I played my PlayStation Portable. Nothing out of the ordinary for me.

Having this habit, it wasn't unusual for me to hear or see strange things. I'd experienced plenty through out the years. This one just stands out because I find it kind of funny.

As I sat there playing my game, out of no where a clock radio that my mom had sitting on the fireplace mantle turned on and started skipping through radio stations. Note that this was an analog radio, meaning that you had to physically rotate the tuner to find a station. After about 3 seconds, it turns off. I even hear the click of the switch.

I thought it was weird but whatever and went back to my game.

About 6 seconds after that, it turned on again and once more started cycling through stations. 

This is where I find it kind of funny because I blurt out ""Would you stop?!"", and instantly right after I had said that the radio switched off and didn't turn on again. And I hear what sounded like someone sit down on the couch by the fire place. I got the funny mental image of a ghostly person, sad and pouting, plopping down and start twiddling their thumbs. 

The image made me feel bad and I actually apologize for sounding mean. I just didn't want my dad waking up and come storming into the living room yelling at me for making noise."
"Alone With A Poltergeist","South Carolina","Haunted Places","This experience[s] happened to me when I was at home by myself. My parents and siblings had gone out of town for the day to visit family and to check on our second property that's about 2 hours away from our home. They wouldn't be back until about 11:00 that night. I was 16, home alone on a Friday night. My mom had bought me snacks, soda and left money for pizza, I had a new video game AND Monday was a holiday! Yeah, life was good!

At around 7:00 I had just ordered my pizza and was in the kitchen pouring a glass of that wonderful Mtn Dew Code Red. I poured my drink and closed the fridge. As I was walking back to the living room I heard the sink in the bathroom that is right next to our kitchen turn on. I froze. 

When I turned to look, I saw that the bathroom light was also on and against my better judgement I went to inspect. Upon walking in, I saw both of the faucets (hot and cold) were turned fully on, water pouring into the sink. I wasn't as much scared as I was just...confused. Shaking it off, I turned the water and light off and went to the living room to wait for pizza. 

About 8:30, I was sitting in the living room watching Tv and hating my life because I'd eaten my entire large pizza in about 11 minutes, when I heard a crashing sound come from our computer room. I jump up, heart racing and run to look. It turned out that some boxes that were stacked in a corner had fallen and were now strewn across the room. 

Naturally, I just assumed that they weren't stacked properly and just fell, so I re-stacked them and went back to watching Tv. 

About 3 minutes later I hear another crashing sound come once more from our computer room. Those damn boxes... So I thought. I go back only to find that a stack of CDs that I had sitting at the BACK of a shelf had been thrown across the room. I guess that ghost didn't much care for Godsmack, Avenged Sevenfold and Seether. But seriously, this time I got really creeped out.

I decided to shut myself in my room with the lights on and wait for my family to get home. But that ghost wasn't done with me yet. 

For context, my older sister's room was next to mine, so we shared a wall. We've always been close, so it was common for her to knock on the wall with three sharp raps to tell me to come see her for something. You may see where this is going.

I was laying in my bed playing my PSP (PlayStation Portable) when suddenly I hear three sharp raps on my wall. Not really thinking, I naturally get up to go see what my sister wanted. As I open my door it hit me she wasn't there. But I knew what I heard. It all made sense to me now! She hadn't gone with our parents, she'd stayed home and was messing with me. Her door was shut so I flung it open to get on to her for messing with me. She wasn't there.

Logically, I'd assumed that she'd just left her room and shut the door. The thing is her door had always had a problem sticking and as such made a loud noise when opened.

If she was there I would have heard the door open and even close because it's one of those doors that even when you're trying to quietly shut will make loud noises.

Regardless, I decided to check the entire house. The house is only a 3 bed 2 bath and was built in 1918. So pretty small by today's standards. I checked every room and closet. Even comically looked in the cabinets and washing machine. Finding nothing, I go back to my room until I hear my family coming in.

First thing my mom asks me was ""how was it being home alone for so long?""

I say, ""creepy"".

Of course she thinks it was because it was so quiet and I had no one to talk to.

I tell her ""No, I mean like weird stuff happening""

Her: ""What kind of stuff?""

Me: ""Well, the bathroom light and sink turned on by themselves. ""

It shocked me when she got upset and told me to shut up.

Her exact words were ""Don't even! Don't even say that! It was years ago that stuff was happening and I sure as hell don't need it to start again!""

This was one of the most profound experiences I've had in that house. But there are plenty more."
"Voice On Tape","South Carolina","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","When I was about 8 years old, my mother had bought one of those tape voice recorders, (this was in 2000 so younger people may not know that voice recorders required cassette tapes as there weren't really digital ones on market). It was around maybe 7:30 at night, me, my big sister, mom and my two younger twin siblings (1 at the time) were sitting in the living room. My dad had just gone to get a shower (this fact comes into play later). Being 8 years old, I grabbed the tape recorder wanting to play with it. You know how kids like playing with stuff like that. So I got the tape recorder to play with and start saying funny things and making noises into it like someone that age would. 

After about my forth time recording myself being silly, I rewound to tape to listen to the play back. Everything sounded the way it was supposed to, me being silly, the twins making the noises of babies, the faint sound from the T.V in the back ground etc. Then near the end of the recording my sister being a typical big sister says to me ""will you quit sounding so stupid?"" If you have older siblings you know how it is.

But the thing that caught me so off guard about her saying that is right after she says it, there is a very deep, gruff older mans voice asking, ""Who are you?"". This voice was the clearest voice on the tape, what now would be classified as a grade A+ EVP. 

Of course this spooked me. I told everyone in the room what I heard. Go figure, they didn't believe me. So I played it for my mom and sister. My sister said ""that was you doing that."" Remember I was 8, so if I had made that voice, we need to check the hormones in the food! My mom told me that was just my dad and to leave it alone! At the time I didn't realize the forceful nature of how she said it.

It was at that time, my dad came walking through the living room. Being the stubborn child I was and ignoring what my mom told me I ask him- 

""Dad""

""what""

""Did you ask ""who are you?"" about five minutes ago?""

""Why the hell would I ask that? Besides, I just got out the shower.""

That's when my mom got mad and told me to stop again.

Unfortunately, that tape is lost to time now. Being that young and not knowing much about the paranormal, it never occurred to me to keep it. It's this experience that I credit the most as to what got me so deeply interested in ghost and the paranormal in general.

[As a side note, years later I've learned of experiences she had in that house before I was born that left her traumatized and is the reason she told me to leave it alone. I'll ask her if its ok to share them.]"
"Possible Ghost Of My Cat Widget That Passed Away","Ohio","Pets / Animals","Hey guys, I feel the need to share this story so I'll give you details about Widget before I start. She was a really old cat that my mother got around a year before she found out she pregnant with me. She was a all black cat that we sadly had to put down at age 20 around a year ago (my sister and I were sobbing in tears since we knew her our entire lives). I do have two other cats Clyde and Isabelle.

This started on October 3, 2020, my sister came to me at around 11:00pm and said that the cat toy bin was kind of shaking in a way but Clyde and Isabell weren't even by the bin. So I told my sister to go to sleep and forget about it. The next day I noticed some of the cat toys (they were those toy mice) have been moved from the bin, but the only one who plays with them is Isabell and Eliza claims that she was sleeping with her all night long because she always has her door closed at night. We decided to tell our mom about it, so we ran to her room and explained everything even what happened the night before. Our mom told us that Clyde could have possibly moved the toys but we know for a fact Clyde doesn't play with those mice toys he likes the balls with the bells inside.

This is a reoccurring thing that has been happening from the start but I have never seen the bin move before so it was possibly Eliza's imagination. I've also seen that Isabelle is afraid of the steps and is scared to go down them. This is strange because when Widget was still around she never liked Isabelle, always was at the bottom of the steps (She had a spot at the landing were she would lay) and never liked it when Isabelle was going down them. Never really liked Isabelle at all, I feel like Widget felt replaced by Isabelle. So Isabelle not going down the steps makes me feel like Widget is down there, just waiting for Isabelle to come down.

Eliza has also been realizing that the door to the bathroom next to the master bedroom has seen to be opening a little, not really moving cause we always have that door slightly open when some one is not in there. I've seen it do that a couple times too. My dad said he's also seen the door do that a couple times when he's heading to his bedroom (aka the master bedroom). My mom has only noticed Isabelle not going down the steps anymore.

Ok so that's really all I have noticed about, if I have more I will make a part two of this. And like I said I do have a sister named Eliza, (her full name is Elizabeth) and we are 3years apart. If you have any questions or thoughts please write them in the comments I will read and participate in the discussion. Bye!"
"Wandering Orb Then Wife's Bad Dream 2016","Idaho","Orbs / Lights / Mists","We moved to Idaho from Hawaii and ultimately moved into an older 3rd floor apartment (2 BR, 1 BA) It had a great view of a creek and a river beyond that out the back windows. We were out looking, and found an amazing view lot across town, which we ended up purchasing. We were very happy and looking for a builder. I found a low paying job and we were just living and enjoying the bike paths and parks along the river's greenbelt.

 One early morning, I was laying awake, as most mornings between 2:00 to 3:30 a.m. I was looking at the clock, and had to lie still because if I wake our Yorkie, he will bolt to end of bed and start biting my feet while barking and would wake my wife (little jerk). Anyway, we had a large King bed in a small room, so the door was very close to the end of the bed and to the right of my feet. The door is open and against the far wall we have little plug-in lights, so the living room and this doorway was kind of lit up. There was a flood light below our bedroom window outside, with slight light coming from sides of curtains above our head board.

 I usually try to fall back to sleep, counting marbles, ducks, salmon, and calming things. I don't count sheep and I don't want to get a song stuck in my head. I was laying on my right side looking at the door opening and saw what looked like a very small Orb come around the door jamb at the doorknob area. It was moving very slowly and was about the size of a golf ball, about 6 feet from my head now, coming along the wall towards my head. Not really thinking, just watching it. It wasn't bright, like Orbs I have caught on my camera or when filming. It was almost a vanilla color (looked old?) less than 3 feet away against wall in front of my face now. I did not move and watched it. It looked dull in a small area top front of the Orb, like it was missing some of its shine (glitter, damaged?), and I watched it go past my head heading to the corner. 

After that, I was heavy in thought and started questioning my sanity and started trying to debunk it - on the 3rd floor, could be car lights? But Orb was lower than the window and curtains were closed. Eye booger floating sideways? (Both eyes? Probably not). Would it have been brighter if room was darker? Did my imagination conjure this thing up? Half my life, I have been a very early riser and have never seen a little orb.

 I can't honestly say how long I laid there - many minutes? - when all of a sudden my wife started stammering, along with heavy breathing. She was in a high-pitched verbal fight and her words were not understandable. Sounded like she was in trouble, and she yelled something high-pitched, stuttering and rambling. I yelled her name while rolling over to her to grab her and shake her awake. She tells me that a man was chasing her as a child and he was not a good man, and he was very scary. By the time she awoke later that morning, she had forgotten most of it. I found it strange that she had a nightmare within minutes of my seeing the Orb, and the timing of both had me wondering about Orbs getting in and being a part of our dreams.

 In my present home, at the beginning of 2021, I had a crazy dream of an approximately 6"" Orb of a dark-haired man (40ish?) his face filled the whole orb that was behind me at head level, chasing me from my garage into our laundry room and into the hallway landing, then into our bedroom (a strait shot) and telling me all the while to hurt (like hit) my wife. I was yelling at him NO, NO, I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT. I woke my wife and myself up from yelling at it. WTH?!

 Thanks for reading. Good Luck out there. (Edited by Wife) Please only positive feedback."
"Whispers And Jingles","Minnesota","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","Here are three paranormal experiences that I have experienced in the past year. 

One day while my little cousins were at my house, we went into the backyard to play. I was enjoying the fall colors when I heard a whisper. It either said, ""I'm here"", ""Over here"", or ""Over where?"" It was a man's voice, probably about 20 - 40 years old. 

When I looked in the direction of the voice, there was nobody there. It most definitely wasn't my uncle's voice, and there were no other adult men there either. I could feel this apparition's voice on my ear. 

A few days later, I told my cousin Tait (other side of family) about it. She said that one day when she was playing outside, she heard a man's voice similar to what I heard say, ""No"".

Another sort of paranormal experience was when me and Tait were recording a YouTube video. We were doing one of those 'slime challenges' where I was blindfolded and my cousin had to direct me to the ingredients. While I was pouring in one of the ingredients, I asked, ""Is this enough?"" and heard a reply, ""Add more"". That wasn't my cousin, though this voice was probably a younger girl's voice. Probably the same age as my cousin. The weirdest part about it was that the voice came up on the video audio. Here's a link to the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTbOIXNJazQ at the time mark of 8:52

The most recent paranormal experience I had was two nights ago. Me and my mom were laying in bed, we had all the windows open because it was very hot in our house. It was late at night. No wind, no rain, not even a breeze, and everything was super quiet when all of a sudden, both my mother and I heard this jingling noise. It sounded either like someone's car keys or some bells. 

My cat started growling when we heard it. So we got up, went to the bathroom, and went back to bed after the jingling stopped. We were thinking, maybe it was someone with their car keys? But there wasn't a single sound of doors opening, cars starting, or anything. And we would have heard it because it was so quiet outside. It was especially scary because my cat started growling. He NEVER growls. 

The only reasonable scenario would be that it was someone's pet that my cat didn't like. But, as I said earlier, we didn't hear any door open or close, so there wasn't anyone letting their pet outside. Plus, I didn't hear any footsteps or walking accompanied with the jingling. 

I came here to ask if you people know of any folklore or mythology that matches with jingling noises or if you've had any similar experiences. 

The only thing I could find about spirits and ringing sounds was that in different religions people used bells to get rid of evil. If you know what the heck it was, please let me know!"
"Lady On The Bus","Minnesota","Psychic / Medium","I'm not sure this counts as a ghost story but I believe it is paranormal, and if not paranormal, it was a strange coincidence that makes me shiver.

I was riding the bus, I believe the 64, which tends to be a busy route (at least pre-pandemic times). This was around 2019. What I remember was there were people on the bus but it was not that full.

I usually keep to myself and just stare out the window. This time there was a lady going off on some kind of speech. I don't remember what she was talking about, but my memory seems to point towards her saying, ""You're the light"" or something like that. I felt a bit unnerved, but chalked that up to being paranoid. I just ignored it.

""I know you can hear me!"" she shouts. Again I just ignore it.

""I see your eye twitch, is that a sign?""

Again I ignore it, but felt slightly more unnerved as if I am being watched. She goes off about me or someone being able to hear her. I figure she is just a crazy lady on the bus. If I kept quiet no one would be aware of this strange ""conversation"". The lady would just be talking to herself as far as everyone else is concerned. Maybe that's what I figured really was going on.

""I see your mouth twitch,"" the lady goes on.

I feel unnerved again, like as if there's something evil trying to invade my thoughts. Just a sinister feeling I'm trying to push away. 

I quietly rebuke it in my head, ""Get thee away from me, Satan, in Jesus's name!"" Granted I didn't consider myself a full Christian, just believe parts, the parts about loving one another, and sins being forgiven. I'm not much into the wrath of God type stories from the Bible.

Now the lady speaks louder, ""So you're Christian now?"" Now I feel like my thought sphere has been invaded.

The lady starts to sing (mockingly) ""This little light of mine! This little light of mine! I'm going to let it shine! Shine!...""

She then said something about not being able to hide the light.

If it weren't for me determined to get to my college classes I would have gotten off the bus. I eventually work up the courage to glance at the lady. She's staring off into space, with a vacant look in her eyes.

I don't know if this lady read my thoughts or was possessed or influenced by something that did, or if it was just a coincidence. Either way I felt frightened by the event."
"My Mom Let Me Know!","Florida","Family / Friends Visits","So my mom passed last year. A quick back story, my mom and I were never super close until about 4 years ago. She moved to Georgia the summer of 2018 and I moved to Florida in September the same year (3 hours away). My husband and I were able to visit several times.

She passed May 5, 2020 during COVID and no one was able to go see her in the hospital. The last thing she said to me that I could understand when I spoke to her last was that she was sad that LJ (her BF) was not there with her. I know she was afraid to die and no one wants to die alone. I did have the nurse hold the phone to her to tell her my sister and her grandchildren and LJ and all her friends love her and that if she needed to go, then go. It sucked and my heart goes out to anyone who lost someone during the pandemic and could not see them, we didn't even get to see the body as she wanted cremated. 

My husband and I recently went up to see LJ and visit my mom's grave. She had given me a Pittsburgh Steelers bracelet a while back and I wore it that day along with my shirt and shoes. DIE HARD FAMILY. It is cloth over what I assume is a light plastic. Anyway, we had a great day. 

The three of us visited her first and took her dog Shadow. I found a beautiful butterfly broach that we attached to her stone. She loved nature and all things in it (except snakes and spiders LOL). My husband bought mulch and did her big flower garden up all nice. I knew she was happy that day as we promised to look after LJ. I was still sad that she died alone. 

When we were on our 3 hr drive home and about halfway in, I realized my bracelet was GONE. I had only brought my wrist-held wallet (a small zipper wallet with a hand strap attached) which I did have on the wrist with the bracelet. I looked everywhere in the car and was devastated that I had lost this bracelet. If you knew my family you would know it was a big deal for her to give me HER Steelers bracelet. So we went home and searched again. I took my wallet in the house and we went to bed. 

The next morning I woke up to get ready for work. I grabbed my actual purse to take to work as all my work keys and such are in there. I had thrown my wrist-held wallet in my purse when we got home the night before as I had to take all the cards and such back out to put in my everyday wallet. When I pulled it out to change everything over, my bracelet was attached to this wrist wallet that I carried in the night before and I knew it was NOT there. 

I cried with excitement and called my husband at work to tell him. He said that my mom did that so I knew that she knew we had been there. I believe that for sure! 

It brought some type of peace to me to know that she gave me a sign that she knew I was there and more than that, I believe it was her way of telling me it is all ok and she is at peace."
"The Murder House","Georgia","Photographs / Videos / EVP","A few years ago, I heard about a murder that happened at a suburban home that's located in a prominent place in my community, on a fairly busy street that many people pass each day. Every time I would drive by this home, which by then was vacant, it was all I could do not to stare at it, especially if the traffic light had turned red. A local man had killed his landscaper in a crime of passion after finding out his wife was having an affair with him. He'd shot the guy, put him in the trunk of his car for days, driving it around and then finally went back to the murder house, dumped the body in the garage and turned himself into authorities. 

I was intrigued by this crime, as the community in which it happened is an upscale place with very little crime. A few months after the murder, someone purchased the house and they built this beautiful gazebo in the back yard (visible because it's on the busy corner) but then put up a tall privacy fence. The house sat for years, and I never did see anyone there.

A little over a year ago, I noticed that the house was for sale. This might sound weird, but I went to the real estate website to look at the photos of the interior of the house. It wasn't entirely because I wanted to see the ""scene of the crime"" but more because I had discovered over the last few years that I can easily notice spirits in photos. My background in newspapers and many photography classes over the years helps me to see when light is not natural, but I suspect it's more about being open to seeing strange images as well as having an eye for detail. In any case, it was obvious from the real estate photos that someone had purchased the house, updated it and was trying to flip it. I didn't see anything unusual in the approximately 20 photos of the house, until I got to a photo that was taken by the photographer from outside the kitchen, from the sunroom on the back of the house. I'm going to send the photo, attached, to the webmaster, not sure how he will display, but I really want to share with you guys and get your thoughts. 

If you look carefully, you can see a figure standing inside the kitchen, looking out the window towards the photographer taking the photo. There are bright squares showing in the kitchen window, which are the reflections of the sunroom windows located behind the photographer. But as you can see, the figure in the window is only visible above the reflection of the other windows. Where the body should be, it cannot be seen... Which I think means the figure is not solid enough to be visible through the reflection. You can make out a man, with dark areas where his eyes should be. It almost looks like he's wearing a hoodie, but maybe not... 



When I spotted this, I snipped the photo and added it to my ""X-Files"" folder, a place where I finally decided to put all the strange photos I started to run across in the last few years. Some of these are personal of my family (with phenomena) and some are just snipped (for example, there was a news conference last year at the White House, and behind the action, in the White House window, I identified a face that looked like one of the presidents... I can't remember which one now, but I had identified it one morning when I was just messing around). I've got a couple dozen photos, have no idea why I'm saving them, but I figure why not?). 

And I kept telling my husband, ""If I had only gotten the name of the Realtor, I could ask whether or not there was another person in the kitchen the day the photos were taken."" To try to debunk this figure, obviously.

So guess what?! Yesterday, I was talking to a new friend I met while working on a local community issue. She's a Realtor, and we had gotten off on a tangent. I mentioned something about the house, and she said, ""Oh, that was MY listing!"" I almost fell off my chair!

I told her about my photo, and that I'd been wanting to ask about the photography session. She knew/remembered immediately that the only one there besides her photographer that day was herself, and she had been upstairs when the photos had been taken. I sent her the photo, and she confirmed that the figure in the kitchen window was DEFINITELY not her and she immediately started telling me the story, how she'd been working for an investor and that he had also dug up the inside of the garage and replaced the cement (she didn't know why and hadn't wanted to know) and that she had been in that house MANY times alone while it was listed. She also said she had to go over there many times because ""people kept leaving lights on after showings, or doors open, or other weird alarm stuff."" I wonder if it was really careless lookers and their Realtors who ""left the lights on.""

Apparently, the people who bought it the first time after the murder had planned to stay (that's why they built the gazebo) but for some reason did not, and moved out after putting quite a bit of money into the place. 

Funny thing: as we were talking and looking at the photo, I also noticed a face (with eyes maybe closed?) in the reflected window/light rectangle just to the left of the more solid looking figure, still in the kitchen window. Do you all see that one? The whole thing is pretty wild, and I wanted to share with you. Look forward to your thoughts. Mrs. R."
"Orb And The Floor Squeaker","Washington","Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations","Nov 2011, First time I encountered a Floor Squeaker. I was recovering from low back surgery. The Staples in my back made it difficult to lay down. It's early morning, I'm sitting up in recliner couch, TV in front of me 12 feet or so away, looking to the right of TV start of hallway and washer dryer doors. Sitting watching TV quietly, I hear extremely loud floor Squeeeak down the hall, my floors are carpet, then another loud Squeeeak and another Squeeeak. I'm almost 200 lbs and have never got my floor to squeeeak, It's moving with purpose Squeeeak. I feel it's cleared the hall and it's not my Wife. Squeeeak and Squeeeak, it's walking towards me. Three more Squeeeaks. I feel it's at the end of my couch now, can't believe what I'm hearing. A quick 3 steps and I know and sensed it's right behind me. I snapped my head back looking up and nothing there. I know it had seen the panic in my face. I tell my wife about Floor Squeaker when she wakes--she says it's probably the pain pills. I had already stopped taking the pain pills, they did nothing.





2nd and last visit of Floor Squeaker. 9-27-2012 Its around 6:30 am, wife just walked out door to work, I just got off work, day light is coming through side of curtains. Just turned tv on, I sleep with TV on, I'm sitting on corner of my side of bed away from mirrored hallway the distance between my knees and TV dresser is about 2 feet, and I hear a very loud floor squeeeak to my right in the mirrored hallway. Floor is carpeted, I look over to mirrors and another loud Squeeeak and another, I feel it's out of the mirrored hall. Whatever it is, it's heavy, another 2 loud Squeeeaks. It's at the end of our cali king bed, I'm thinking what the hell, Squeeeak Squeeeak, shiate! It's next to me. I'm freaking, Squeeeak, it somehow passed in front of me between my knees and tv dresser and that squeeeak was on the other side of me on my side of bed. Panicked, I run out of room, standing in the hallway, in disbelief and angry it would walk right by me without showing itself or at least wave or something.

I hurry to living room to grab my NIKON coolpix camera, fire it up on my way back to bedroom, push door open take 2 steps in, see nothing in room. Snap 1st picture. Hoping to see a big ugly something, nothing but a white glowing ball above me in the center of my side of bed. I point camera a little higher, Snap 2nd picture. Darn thing is coming at me leaving circle trail behind it. I know it's going back into the mirrors, stumbling I get around to wife's side, sit and Snap 3rd picture. Picture of mirrored hallway above door in brown area could be flash but is reflected in mirror on the right with smaller orb next to it. In closet mirrors, that is 1 blue towel on something black on the floor. I see in my hurry out of the room, I threw the channel changer, I turned volume down after 2nd squeak. We had pic of orb over bed blown up and printed, definitely a mind bender. If you can enlarge, you can see?"
"We Call Him Steven","Ohio","Pets / Animals","We moved into my husband's house a little over 3 years ago. He's always had cats and I've always had dogs and cats. He had a cat many years ago who passed (we miss Thumbs. He was a sleek black and white tuxedo). I've seen a cat sitting in the back window before when my cat was outside and before we got the kitten. 



A few months ago I had a night to myself in the house. Hubby was out and my daughter was with her dad. We currently have a 9 year old cat, a 7 month old kitten and 2 dogs 9 and almost 8. I was sitting on the couch just chilling and looked toward the kitchen table. The chain for the ceiling fan was swinging wildly for about 3 minutes. Then it just stopped. Not slowed down just stopped. The kitten regularly sits on the table and stares at the wall or tries to get the chains, but he was in my arms at the time. I tested this the other night and the chain swung for only a few seconds before slowing to a stop. I told my daughter about it when she came home and she said ""I've seen a ghost cat here before"" (so had I but I never told anyone). My daughter and I named him Steven. We have no idea why, but it was the first name that came to mind. Here's the freaky part and I'll try to attach the photo. My daughter was holding the kitten ""mom, take a pic!"" I took 3. There is clearly a ghost cat (or so we think) with bright green eyes on her shirt. It was a plain gray t-shirt. It was not in the other photos. Showed my husband and he says ""oh yeah! I've seen it here before"".

Please tell me what you all see. I'll answer when I can and will answer any questions."
"Carol And The Man With The Top Hat - My Daughter's Ghosts","Washington","Family / Friends Visits","It all began when my daughter was around 2 or 3. I had put her in her crib for a nap and told her I wasn't going to turn on the ceiling fan because it wasn't that warm in the room. The only way you can activate the fan is to pull the chain from the fan itself which is above most adult's heads, or the switch on the wall which was several feet away from the crib, by the door. Neither would be possible for a 2 or 3-year-old to reach from her crib. Standing, her head was level to the top of the crib. The fan was absolutely turned off (the switch in the off position) as I walked out of the room.

About an hour or so later, I walked past the room and the fan was on! ""What in the heck?!"" I thought. I walked into the room and the switch was in the ON position. Perplexed, I looked over and there was my daughter sitting up in her crib. I half-jokingly asked her ""Who turned the ceiling fan on?!"" Of course not expecting an answer. Without hesitation she simply and matter of factly stated ""Grandpa Breda."" 

My blood ran cold. My daughter was born nearly 15 years after my father died in a car accident. She only knew of him through an old photo and mentioning him rarely, in passing. She never wavered, always insisted that it was him who turned on the ceiling fan.

About a year or two later my wife and I were watching TV in the family room downstairs. We had one of those baby monitors in her room turned down but where you could see it light up if there was noise (like crying or talking, etc). We both noticed it starting lighting up. Assuming she was crying, we turned the volume up. Instead, what we heard was her carrying on a conversation with somebody. Laughing, answering questions seemingly, just what you would expect if someone was talking to her. So I went upstairs and asked her who she was talking to. She simply responded ""Carol.""

And thus began the story of Carol. She would describe her as blonde, older teenager or so. The first time she saw her she walked right through one of her bedroom walls which scared her. But she eventually learned that Carol was friendly and meant her no harm. Through the years she would add some detail mentioning that Carol had a little sister and brother who died in a fire and the father was very mean. She was both descriptive and adamant in what she was saying. My wife and I couldn't find any source at the time where she could be influenced by such accounts. This was long before being exposed to ghost/paranormal/crime shows.





One time when we heard her talking in her room again, I asked her if she wouldn't mind taking a photo of Carol for me. With a simple shrug of her shoulders she said okay. I showed her how to operate the camera and off she went. I stood behind the closed door and heard the familiar click of the camera. Then I heard her say something, and another click. When she came out of the room I asked her if she was able to take a photo of Carol and she said yes. The first photo simply showed her room. The second however, was nearly pure white. I asked her what that was and she said that was when she asked Carol to appear. I've attached the before and after photos below.

She would see Carol on and off until she was about 10 or 11 (she's 15 now). Carol never frightened her but the man in the top hat most certainly did. She would run out of her room screaming at night, saying there was a tall man in a top hat staring at her at the foot of her bed. Poor thing was clearly petrified of something. She described him as very tall, no features, more like a shadow/silhouette with a ""old style"" hat like a top hat.

This went on also until just about two or three years ago. There were times we could not get her to sleep in her own room for months at a time, instead sleeping in our room or the spare room. It may be worth noting that one time as I slipped consciously out of my body during an astral projection, I too noticed a dark figure in the room wearing a hat of some sort. I didn't get a good look as it was in my peripheral and I didn't want to stick around so I quickly left the room.

Another time my daughter was taking a shower and noticed in the fogged up mirror tiny hand prints. She swore it wasn't hers and sure enough they were too small to be hers or anyone else's in our home. That went on for about a week or so. We almost had a psychic medium come out to the house but didn't have the money to spend on that at the time. To this day, we still have activity but neither of us feels there's any real demonic entities, at least nothing has happened (outside of the tall man sightings) to suggest that. However, there's no doubt we have/had spirits in our home. Including my most recent sighting, a full apparition (my first) in the daytime! You can read about that account in my story ""I Just Saw A Full Apparition Ghost!"" on this website.

If I had to guess, I think most of the spirit activity is family, perhaps both my sister and father at times, and possibly others. Recently my daughter asked for dowsing rods so we have been experimenting reaching out to spirits using them. We've had tremendous luck (I was always skeptical but once I tried them I was floored by how strongly they would move to either the YES or NO positions when I would ask a question). We have deduced that there is currently a teenage boy hanging around. He allegedly committed suicide in his late teens and lived somewhere in the region/State. My daughter says she has seen him in her dreams and knows what he looks like. We don't think he means any harm but we are unclear what brought him here. We asked if my sister was ""Carol"" and I got a hard and emphatic YES. While on one hand it would completely make sense (my sister would be a guardian angel to her one and only niece no question, and she had blonde hair and while died at 25, would likely present herself in her late teens), I struggle with the other elements surrounding Carol's story (the siblings who died in a fire, etc).

Perhaps I will get that reputable psychic medium to come out. We would love to have answers to all this spirit activity through the years that continues to this day."
"I Saw It Again!","Florida","Haunted Places","So as I told in my last encounter ""My husband's Doppelganger?"" I had seen what I only know as to be an entity that looked like my husband sitting on the side of the bed in his pajamas he wore that night to bed while my husband laid sleeping. 

I am still not sure what it is.

However 3 nights ago, I was laying in bed awake. As I was facing my husband, I watched an entity get out of the bed right where he was laying again in his pajamas he had worn that night. I watched frozen in fear as this entity ""kneeled"" up onto my husbands chest. It sat there for a minute or to until I closed my eyes. I did not see it leave but when I opened my eyes what felt like just a few minutes, it was gone.

I know what I have read and people have told me that Doppelgangers are a bad omen. Things have been good -""knock on wood""- and he hasn't developed any new health problems.

While he believes in the supernatural and such (he had an experience of being pressed many years before me) but he says nothing when I tell him except that he does not remember anything. 

It is kind of freaking me out. Like what is this? I have saged the house, etc...

He does have a lot of nightmares and not being a jerk but there are times I believe he is bi-polar. When he has his nightmares, I dare not touch him for comfort or he gets super mean with his words. He says it is just the nightmare that makes him feel this way. I actually freeze in fear when he has a nightmare. Sometimes I can't sleep or am frightened to sleep. I don't know what this is. Anyone have any thoughts?

The house is a newer home and nothing has previously happened at the house that I have seen in my research. PLEASE ANY THOUGHTS."
"Little Kid Ghost?","Maryland","Haunted Places","I am going to tell you guys another true story that happened to me in Maryland in 2011. My wife and I rented a house in Waldorf MD, I never felt right in that house. When I looked at it from the outside, it looked a little dark, even during the early afternoon. The house had wooden floors throughout the living room and kitchen. When ever I would watch TV by myself downstairs I always heard little foot steps behind me. When I turned around to see who/what it is, they stop. When I would be by myself in the house upstairs, I always felt someone watching me. When I got halfway down the stairs the feeling would stop. 

My teenage daughter would tell me all the time "" Daddy I think we have a ghost/presence here in the house."" My wife didn't believe us.

 One day I was upset with the ghost and I heard footsteps go to the edge of the living room, so I went to where I heard the steps and I said "" Show yourself, I know you are there."" The footsteps then went away from me and walked over to the other side of the living room. Again I said "" Show yourself"". Nothing happened, nothing appeared.

 We lived in this house for 2 years and I never saw anything but I for sure heard things and felt things. I was always on guard at the house. I never could relax either. I read on the internet that a 5 year old girl got shot to death by a stray bullet at our house years earlier (like 1999 I think). We had a little playground thing in our back yard too. I think maybe she is the ghost at our house? Please tell me what you guys think. No jokes or smart remarks please."
"The Witches Cackle","Maine","Haunted Places","Growing up in a small town with a haunted history, you are bound to hear a story or two. One of the most popular stories in the small town that I grew up in was about a Witch that the founder of the town, Jonathan Buck had burnt at the stake many moons ago. She told him that she would dance on his grave and now every time it rains there is an imprint of her leg and foot that appear on his gravestone. The stone has been moved and replaced many times, but yet she still finds him every time. Everybody loves the thrill of a good ghost story, but what happens when a story turns into a reality? What happens if instead of hearing the story, you are living it?

 I have had many experiences with Paranormal Activity in my life, some pleasant, and some not, but this story STILL sends chills up my spine every time that I talk about it. I would like to start by saying that because of the fact that I did not own the house that this incident occurred in, I will not be including the exact address, however I will include the Street name and the town. I do not know if I will be able to make you feel the bone chilling terror that I felt during the experience, but I will do my best.

 In the spring and summer of 2019, my Fiancé and I were renting a house on Nicholson Ave in Bucksport Maine, right up the road from Jonathan Bucks gravestone. For those of you that don't know, Bucksport is very well known for it's Haunted history, so as two young adults that were raised in this town, and very connected to the Paranormal, it wasn't unheard of for us to experience Paranormal Activity in some form or another once in a while. 

 At first, it just started out very minor. Little noises, things moving by themselves, that sort of thing. One night we even came downstairs from our bedroom to find three bowls perfectly lined up on our living room floor. Little things like that were nothing that my Fiancé and I were not used to, so they did not really bother us, but then came the night that changed the entire feel of the house.

 On this night, we had stayed up extremely late. I remember dozing off around 1am. I had this nightmare that we were sitting in bed and we heard this gut-wrenching woman's laugh. It sounded like a Witches Cackle. In the dream, it was as though I was hovering above the bed watching the scene unfold. I could see us sitting up in bed, and I could hear myself say ""What is that?"" as my Fiancé got out of the bed and exited the room to go check it out, and then the dream stopped. 

 The next morning, I did not say anything about the ""dream"" because I have had many nightmares and night terrors over the years, so I didn't really think anything of it, until later that afternoon when we had some friends over. We were all just hanging out and having a good time, when my Fiancé started telling our friends the events of the night before. He started telling them about the ""Witches Cackle"". I instantly felt the color leave my face. I felt cold. I slowly looked up at him. ""Wait a minute. That actually happened?"" I asked, feeling myself start to shake.

 ""What do you mean? Of course, it did."" He responded. 

I stared into space for what seemed like an eternity. ""I...I thought that I dreamt it. I remember being asleep. I remember watching the whole thing happen like it was a movie."" IT WAS NOT A NIGHTMARE. It happened.

 He then proceeded to repeat everything that had happened, down to every detail. Us sitting in bed, us hearing the Cackling, me telling him to go check it out. EVERYTHING. He told me that when he went to see where the laughing was coming from, he got out into the hallway where the lights were on, and that it sounded like it was right in front of him, almost in his face. He then followed it downstairs into the kitchen, and then it stopped. 

I felt the chills running up and down my back. After that, there was a constant feeling of dread in the house. It always felt like we were being watched, like we are strangers in our own home. It seemed like every time I laid down to go to sleep at night, I could still hear that awful laughing, like I was being taunted by something that I could not see. We never found out what it was, but what I can tell you is, it was truly Evil, and I don't believe that it wanted us or anyone else living in that house. Once that entity made itself known, you could truly feel the darkness of it, and there was no peace in that house for us after that. 

 We moved out a short time later, and we have not been back. Yes, I have had many Paranormal experiences in my life, but this one was different. This was an Evil that I had never experienced before. This was Demonic. You could feel the Evil like it was a sickness. I do not know who lives there now, but I hope for their sake, they have better luck in that house than we did, because I have chills right now even writing about it, and to this day, every time I tell this story, I can still hear ""The Witches Cackle"""
"Touched On The Face","Washington","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","After selling the mirrored hallway home, we moved into one of our rentals. We had been remodeling it for a couple of months, while it had been empty. This rental was up for sale, and we planned to move to Hawaii after selling. In this rental home, I had my best Spirit Crossing. 

It was about 4:00 p.m., kind of overcast outside and I'm sitting on the couch watching TV. I have a blanket pulled up to my neck, and both of my hands are under the blanket. These are townhomes so there are cars parked out front of our windows in their stalls. So, I'm watching TV when suddenly I am being touched under my left eye, feels like a finger tip drags under my eye, touching the bridge of my nose and then drags under my right eye all the way across, and then is gone.

 I look to my left and my wife was at the kitchen sink, with our Yorkie at her feet, about 12 ft away from me. I was so amped and amazed at this that I could have blasted through the ceiling. I couldn't debunk it, as I felt it was a full-on spirit contact. I always hoped it was my Mom stopping to say hi before we moved to Hawaii. I will ask her when I get to the other side. I tell her I love her almost every day.

 These were older Townhomes - could also have been a wandering spirit. There were deaths in these Townhomes, as with most older neighborhoods.

Note:2ND Short- After the Medium and myself sent the curly-haired mirror guy to the Light in the mirrored hallway home, she said I should get a journal and record the visitations. I bought a medium-sized journal and was in our small bedroom at my wife's computer table. I had just written MY NEW FRIENDS on the cover and had opened to record a crossing, and felt a Spirit had leaned in over my left shoulder. I could feel the strong current, goosebumps and static it was throwing. It did seem interested in my Journal and then it was gone, about a 6-second visit. I have since thrown the journal away because now I have this site to record my experiences. Thanks for reading and Good Luck out there."
"The White Lady Of Burger King Isn't Alone Anymore","Nevada","Haunted Places","So here's the part II I promised you and it's been a long time coming.

That said so much has happened in the past several months this Part II just kept getting longer. So I'm going to start by saying that by now, there isn't a single person who has worked night shift that doesn't have a story.

We have named the ghosts. There is the lady in white, we call Helena. A tall man named Slim. A shadow figure named ""Let's never meet that thing"". And ""Peeping Tom"" the affectionate name I've given to the playroom ghost.

I'll start by talking about Slim. Slim started passing around when my manager confirmed that the voice she was hearing now daily in the morning was a male. This was the first we'd heard about it. But not the last. 

Things escalated to the night shift the night we found this out. We were closing the lobby for the night and just turning out the lights when I saw him. A tall man in the cover of the darkness - it was the clearest picture I had ever gotten of a ghost here: 

He was tall, at least 6 feet, with slicked back hair. And a clean pressed suit. What immediately struck me was how angry the man looked. 

To say the least I nearly jumped out of my skin. But what scared me most was that it was a full minute before he seemingly vanished into thin air. Still glaring daggers at me. 

Since then, he's been one of our most active spectral residents. People claim to hear a male voice near the bathrooms especially. It seems to have a thing for the aforementioned manager. When her kids were visiting one was asking about our ghosts and mentioned that many times in the bathroom she could hear a man talking on the other side of the wall.

He is TRULY creepy. Given we do live in Las Vegas I don't doubt this is a mobster. Hence the generic monster name we've given him. He's harmless - but the glare that always accompanies him. And his desire to stay in the shadows of our lobby gives me the chills. Too many to count. 

Next, I'll talk about by far my most terrifying experience. Sadly, I wish I could have recorded my one encounter with a shadow person. But I was too stunned to do so.

Recently, our ghosts have been playing with our security cameras. It all started with one truly terrifying night. Everyone had gone home for the night, and I was staying late with some last minute counts. When something caught my eye...,

There was a figure, or rather a shape on the camera feed. At first I suspected a bug. But to my astonishment, and horror, it took a human shape. Before I knew it, I was watching this figure calmly walk from one feed to the next. Walking the length from the back room to the front register before disappearing through a wall.

I went to check everything that night. Every door was locked, every window. The bathrooms were empty. The playroom was empty.

I couldn't get out of there fast enough. It was enough that my General Manager said she wouldn't have blamed me if I had quit on the spot.

This was just the beginning of our video issues. From then on all manner of apparition has appeared on feed. From a massive colorful radiating light that will come through on some nights, to a strange visitor I jokingly call ""Peeping Tom"" who seems to enjoy the play room.

Peeping Tom is actually how our stories got credence. It has turned a sceptic into a believer. As we watched someone clearly playing in our currently closed playroom. We both went to check on it, both still saw it on the camera as we did... And of course, to our abject horror in person no one was there. He only shows up on the video feeds. Haven't quite figured that out yet.

Things are so normal now we've started to adjust. But they are obviously getting much spookier.

But Helena did the scariest thing I can speak of. By far the most terrifying of all.

We thought she and the others simply stuck to the lobby. Hell, I even believed they'd leave us in peace. But recently we've been under renovation with our lobby currently closed. We hadn't seen any of them in days. And I assumed the shadow figure was a one time occurrence.

Two nights ago. I was putting away food when I was greeted by Helena, the lady in white. Inches from my face between the spaces of our food trays.

I had to stifle a scream and spooked the entire staff, as I was the only one who saw her. But now, we all know that the ghosts are -very- much in control of who sees them, where they are seen, and where they are... I don't know why it frightens me so much. They aren't hurting anybody. But having thought the kitchen as our safe space it certainly was not comforting.

So, greetings from Las Vegas' very haunted little Burger King. I hope maybe I'll have some crazier stories on the horizon. But until next time, I think we'll keep the lights on in the lobby for a while."
"The House On Bradley Drive","Alabama","Haunted Places","I was entering the sixth grade when my mother, our two dogs and I moved to Montgomery, Alabama after going through a particularly brutal divorce from her 3rd husband. The house she purchased wasn't huge or fancy. It was a small 3 bedroom, 1 bath built in the early 1800's. The walls were poured concrete, the door knobs were crystal, and the floors were still the original hardwood. It had a good foundation and a lot of character in a quiet neighborhood filled with elderly people. For a while, it seemed like the perfect place for us.

We were so happy to have a fresh start and a house to call her home. So happy that when the previous home owner came to get some old mail and refused to come inside the gate, we didn't even question it. The woman who sold us the home was in her late twenties at the time, and she said she'd bought the house for her and her fiancé who had tragically passed in a car accident. The owners before her I believe died in the house but we were told from old age. 

Anyway everything seemed to be going great for a while. I settled into school, and my mom settled into her new job. We both easily adapted and made new friends. I can't pinpoint exactly when everything started, mostly because I was trying too hard to convince myself it was only my eyes playing tricks on me or I was simply tired or mistaken. Countless times I'd see a tiny little dog out the corner of my eye and would write it off thinking it was our Pomeranian or chihuahua, the problem was when I'd see the creature our dogs weren't even in the same room.

 There's no telling how long I would have denied what I was seeing, if one night when it happened my mother hadn't been in the same room. We were standing there in the dining room talking when we both turned our heads at the same time to look at the tiny dog sized creature that ran past us into the living room. When she saw me turn my head too she said, ""omg you saw it too?"" It had been happening to her the entire time as well, and guys that's only the beginning of the creepiness. 

My aunt and uncle came to stay with us when passing through on their way to Florida to see a NASCAR race. They slept in the living room where you guessed it, the creature made its appearance, but this time crawled onto their air mattress while they were on it. But of course when they went to find the dog, nothing was there. My uncle wrote it off, saying he thought it was a giant nutria rat, but he also said he'd never be staying at our house again. From here things only escalated.

At this time I shared a bed with my mother as we only could afford the one at the time, and a lot of our furniture had been lost in Katrina. Well we are in bed and we both feel one of the dogs jump in the bed with us. It's the middle of the night and highly annoying to have little feet stepping all over your legs. My mom says, ""Ali, go get the dog and put it back in the kennel."" The kennel was right by the bed so it wasn't really a big task. I start to stir in order to grab for the pup, but he jumps down and retreats under the bed. I turn on the light and bend down so I can grab him and open the kennel door to put him in. And guys this is the part that terrified me. I could still hear the thing under the bed, but it was not my dog, because my dog was in the kennel. They both were and had been all night, so I scream and jump back on the bed. I'm terrified and my mother is confused. She wants to know what's wrong so I tell her, ""mom, the dogs are in the cage."" Now she's freaked out, but goes to look under the bed and there's nothing there. 

Fast forward a week or 2. I'm doing my homework in the living room, when I hear my mother's voice frantically calling for me. I wasn't sure what to expect but what happened next I will never forget. I travel down the hall and enter the bedroom where she was at and am met by a glowing green orb hovering near the doorway where I was at so again I'm terrified and jump in the bed with her. I'm also very mad she called me to be in the room with it. Meanwhile my brain is trying to make some logical explanation that was anything but supernatural for this glowing green monstrosity that was moving up and down, up and down on the floor, on the walls, and the center of the room. I looked to the window hoping someone maybe was playing a joke maybe there was a laser beam maybe something, anything but what was my reality. Then the orb vanished. It was over. 

A few weeks more passed and my mom has her friend come stay the night with us. We made her a pallet on the floor in the room we were also sleeping in. Everything was fine and we had a great movie night, but we were tired so we go to bed.

 My mom and I were both sound asleep when we heard my mom's friend screaming. I quickly jump up to turn on the lights and found myself looking at a traumatized house guest. She said someone had been sitting on top of her and tried to choke her but there was no one there. She refused to come back after that.

Now we were in this house a few years. The only constant occurrence was the dog creature. Eventually I got my own room. I hadn't been sleeping in there long when I was woken by my bed shaking and what seemed to be a 7 foot tall hooded figure standing there holding out its hand for me to take. I didn't and I was too terrified to move or even scream. This is probably the most terrified I've ever been in my life. I've been told it sounds like sleep paralysis but I swear I was awake and there was something in my room that wanted me to come with it. I don't know what would have happened if I'd taken that outstretched hand but I don't think I'd be here today recounting these events. 

At this point my mom had had enough of the thing in our house. We tried blessing all the rooms, and even having a priest come. We burned sage and tried cleansing rituals, but the thing never left. Eventually my mother listed the house for sale and we planned on moving back to Mississippi. It took a year for the house on Bradley drive to sell. During that time my mother had gotten a work friend to come by and check on it. This didn't last long. One night the work friend and her boyfriend came by the house and apparently decided they were going to get romantic in the bedroom. Her boyfriend put her on the bed and went to take her shirt off, well during this she caught sight of the 7 foot tall demon blocking the doorway. The boyfriend turned and looked. He saw it too. She said it just felt like it wanted them out, and like all the other things it just faded out after what felt like an eternity of them staring at it in horror. They too refused to come back inside the house. 

Since we moved the house has been sold over and over and over. It was even foreclosed upon. I honestly wonder if the residents that followed us had the same problems. I drove past that house for the first time since we moved a few months back. I want to say it'd been since 2006 since I'd seen it. It appears that there was a fire and the two car garage in the back yard had completely burned down. I'd love to know what happened. I'd love to know what was in that house, but I guess I never will."
"Floor Squeaker #2","Washington","Haunted Places","As usual, I just got home from working a 12-hour night shift. It's around 6:30 a.m. And my wife is just about to leave for work. We chat and she heads out the door. I take my boots and socks off - no better feeling after 12 hours of hustling on them. I must immediately try to calm myself down, shower, and get ready for sleep, or I might get my second wind and won't be able to sleep at all. We had rentals, antique cars, and remodeling, always multi-tasking.

I'm in our bedroom, barely sitting on the corner of the bed on my side. To my right, across my wife's side of the bed and about 8' away is the start of our mirrored hallway to the Master Bath. From my angle, I see all of the right side of the mirrored closet doors, which reflects the left side. I always turned the TV to the stock market because my hobby is buying and selling the occasional stock. And it's easy to fall asleep to... 

We had a California King bed in a very small Master bedroom, so there was less than 3' walking room around the entire bed. I was about to get a bedtime change of clothes from the dresser that was about 18 inches from my knees, and head to the shower. I heard one loud floor squeak and then another, coming from my right and in the mirrored hallway. I know that something has just stepped out of the mirrors again. I reached in front of me and turned down the TV which was on top of my dresser. I looked over to the mirrored hallway and nothing was there. I heard two more floor squeaks and thought it made it out of the mirrored hallway, next to my wife's side of the bed. I hadn't even been home for 10 minutes, as if it was waiting for me. Two more squeaks and I feel it's at the corner of the bed, with the bedroom door directly to the right and it's partially open. There were two more loud floor squeaks coming my way and was right next to me on my right. My mind goes into overdrive thinking it's bigger than me; I'm dumbfounded. I could not make my own floor squeak at 200 pounds!

Now, the next squeak I hear comes up on the other side of me! Somehow, it either went above me, or through me...? I freak, and bolt off the bed and out of the bedroom, throwing the channel changer. At this time, I was 54 years old and never moved that quickly in my life. I was pacing in the hallway and was irritated that it would just move past me and not acknowledge that I was there. The door had partially closed after I hit it exiting the room.





I then headed to the Living Room to get my camera, fired it up, and headed back to the bedroom. I pushed the door open, took two steps in, there's nothing there, but I take my first picture. There was nothing, but a disco ball orb above my bed and over my head appearing in the picture. I pointed the camera up and snapped a second picture. The Orb was bigger and coming towards me, leaving a circle trail behind it. My wife accidentally erased that picture.: (I felt it was headed back into the mirrored hallway. I got to the wife's corner of the bed, stumbling and trying to lay on the bed to get the shot down the hallway. But I came up short and couldn't get the shot. So, I spun around and sat up in the middle of the bed (losing seconds bumbling around), and snapped the 3rd picture of the mirrored hallway. There was also an Orb in this picture, which was reflected in the right side mirror. 

When my wife got home from work, I showed her the pictures on the camera. While showing her the pictures of the Orbs, I noticed that all the blankets were on my side of the bed and asked her if she had any trouble sleeping the night before. She said No, and that sometimes she would just sleep on my side of the bed while I was at work. I hoped this was a family member or a friend who had passed. I don't like invisible visitors or crap happening in Darkness. My imagination only thinks the worst. Full on apparitions in daylight hours are easier for me to handle.

This is the last story of the experiences in the mirrored hallway home. We lived in that home for 14 years, and we were constantly remodeling in the first 9, with no spirit activity. These spirit crossings that I've written about, previously and now, were in almost the last 5 years (after installing the opposing mirrors in Master hallway) of living in that home, and have since sold and moved away. I wanted to share the mirror experiences and put this to rest, but I've experienced more happenings since leaving this home. 

I choose not to be included in discussions because I am just here to share my experiences - not to have them picked apart. I will join discussions on future experiences, but they won't be regarding any of the experiences in this home. These are true happenings and worded to the best of my (and wife's) ability. (Typed by wife -- for better clarity)"
"The Strange Twin Taping On The Door At 2am","Ohio","Haunted Places","Hey guys! I'm new here, you can call me Lillie, please don't be rude if I don't have it exactly in detail, I sometimes forget little details after a while, sorry😅.

Summer,2020

 It was around 2:00am, I'm not sure exactly what time it was but it was around that time. I wasn't asleep, I was in the living room sipping on some juice because I was thirsty, it usually happens at night. I went to sit on the couch by my two cats, Clyde and Isabell. About 5 minutes of sitting down I heard a tapping noise by the door, I ignored it first thinking my ears are playing a trick on me.

 Surely enough it wasn't my imagination, so I went to check it out with Clyde closely following behind. I paused and peered around, no one was there just a staircase, door and my cat slowly walking down the steps. When he reached the bottom he sniffed around and a few seconds later went into the basement out of site, though he was hurrying down I just thought he had to use the litter box. I just forgot about it and headed back to bed.

 Two days later I was texting my friend who at the time had a house with two ghosts in it, but she moved to a different place that's still close. When I told her about the taping by my door she totally looked shocked and said the same thing happened to her the same night around the same time. Now a million thoughts were in my head. Twin tapping by door? I was so confused! For the past couple hours we kept talking about this crazy coincidence, but I wasn't so sure. I started to believe these tapping by doors things were connected somehow, I just couldn't put my finger on it, so we stopped talking and went to bed.

 After my friend and I were talking and went to bed I had these strange dreams. And each one has this girl in it named Bella, she has blonde brown hair, a pink flowery dress, and was some scratches on her face. At the end of the dreams she always says ""remember me"". I'm not sure why. 

About 2 months after the tapping by the door she randomly disappeared, only 4 weeks ago she came back, but she looks more scared and has more scratches. I'm totally confused, I believe that Bella could be a spirit that was killed at a young age and communicates with me in my dreams, but its only a guess.

Tell me what you think about this? What should I do about this Bella girl?"
"Do I Help The Spirit?","Tennessee","Ouija Board / Seances","I am a fifteen year old female who moved into a new house a year ago. 

 I used an Ouija board to communicate with a ghost. Her name is Carol and she died when she was ten years old. She wants me to find her body. I asked her how she died and she said buried alive. I asked her why she was here and she said she wants revenge. I asked how I could help and she said ""find my body"".

There is a spot in my yard the size of a ten year old that is in between three trees placed into a perfect triangle. I want to help her but I am afraid that I'll find something. I also dabble in a little witchcraft, but I just call myself an earth witch. I just deal with plants not any witchcraft, black magic as some people call it. 

 Should I help the spirit? I want to because she's going to be stuck here until she gets revenge but I don't want to find a dead body in my backyard. My mom is extremely religious and I don't want to tell her because she will be like ""you're lying bla bla bla"". I want to help her because no one should ever have to go through that. 

I find her presence calming like a friend when I collect plants. I think I should help her but I don't know. I'm afraid that if I do find something my mom will loose the house because it's part of a murder scene. Should I find someone with a scanner to see if something is there? I feel like she's at that spot but I don't know for sure. 

The house is a hundred years old and has belonged to several different owners some of them are dead. Should I help the ghost?"
"Could She Be Me?","Washington","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","In the past few months I've had a couple of really strange things happen at my home, which isn't out of the ordinary for my place, but I'm actually stumped when it comes to finding answers as to why and how this is happening? There have been three separate incidents that took place, all involving something that sounds very close to my voice. At first, I thought that I had probably experienced one incident that could be labeled as an ""auditory hallucination"", but the other two experiences didn't fit the criteria - and one involved my neighbor/friend seeing and hearing me.

My first experience with hearing the voice happened after I decided to make a spur of the moment trip back to my house, after I got to the store and realized I left my purse back at home. It was a weekday and the house was empty, two of my children were at school, and my oldest son was at work, which left only Janice and Jethro at home. Janice and Jethro are the latest edition to our family; two 10 month old kittens I adopted back in January. While I entered through the back patio door, both cats greeted me as I made my way into the family room looking for my purse. As I try to dodge cats running around my feet, I suddenly hear a woman's voice coming from the next room over. This is where it gets weird: my cats stop in their tracks and look toward the kitchen where the voice is coming from. I instinctively froze and my thoughts began to run wild - Is someone in my house? How did they get in? The weirdest part of this was that the voice sounded a lot like mine when I would call my cats to the kitchen for treats, right down to me calling their names, the voice mimicked mine. But why would some stranger be in my house talking to my cats, it made no sense? I had to investigate this even though I was feeling shaken and totally taken off guard! As I make my way into the kitchen with cats trailing close behind, I find no one. I walked through the entire house, no sign of anyone, and the house appears to be secure. At that point I shrug it off and assume I was hearing things... 

The second incident happened about a week after the first one, with my neighbor and good friend Liz, who claimed she heard what sounded and looked like me chatting with someone when she dropped off a few items at my house.

 Liz had called me earlier in the day saying she picked up a few things from the craft store that she thought I could use, so I told her to leave the items on the back walkway because I would be at work all day. After she dropped the items off, she called my cell and asked why I hadn't answered the door when she knocked? I had no idea what she was talking about, and I was confused because I thought she knew I wouldn't be home - I explained that that it couldn't have been me because I was still at work. There was a long pause, and then she told me that she saw me walking around inside my house and heard what sounded like I was carrying on a conversation with someone - she insisted it was me. Liz doesn't discuss anything remotely paranormal, so we just swept that conversation under the rug so to speak...

The last odd experience happened a few weeks ago, while my son and I decided to spend the evening watching Netflix. I settled into the sofa, my son Will sat across from me in a recliner and scrolled through movies. The house was quiet, my daughter had already gone to bed and my other son was at a friend's house. After a bit, Will looks over at me and asks what I would like to watch, and just as I'm about to decide on which movie to choose there's this loud female voice that comes out of nowhere - in what sounded like it filled the space between us, we clearly hear ""Turn that down!"" and then nothing. Both of us just stared at each other completely perplexed, not really sure of what just happened. Then Will said to me, ""Whoa, how did you do that without moving your lips!?"". All I could do was shake my head and look around the room - I have to admit the voice sounded a lot like mine, yet it definitely wasn't me. There wasn't any ghostly apparition, no visual disturbance, nothing except that clear audible voice. The volume on the t.v. Was relatively low, and we hadn't even started watching anything prior to that, so there wasn't any sound coming from the television.

This experience was really strange and I still haven't been able to find an explanation for it, other than at first I thought maybe a disembodied voice was the reason for what we were hearing? Could it possibly be poltergeist activity? Or is it more along the lines of simultaneous existence in regard to another dimension (me 2.0, from some other dimension)? 

 I was wondering if anyone at YGS had heard of any similar experiences, or could suggest what might have caused this?"
"Collection Of Hauntings","North Carolina","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I have a collection of stories I would like to share with everyone, only one of these stories involves me and most of them have to do with my mother so I hope you enjoy!.

 I will start with my first story involving me as a kid, I personally have no recollection of these events but my mother had told me this recently, apparently many nights I would come to my mom and dad saying I saw Satan in a ball of fire above my door way, being that my family is full of devout Christians they decided to pray over my room and I never saw it again.

 The next few stories take place across the street at my grandmas old house which she no longer owns.

 Long ago in that house lived a doctor and his wife, one night they got into an argument and got into a fight. They both wrestled for their shotgun and he ended up accidently shooting her, or so the reports say, but being that this is a small southern town back decades ago the chances of them just taking a doctor's word for it was very high.

 One day my grandmother was in her house and she decided to go upstairs where our attic is, there the doctor kept all of his medical texts and personal items. My grandmother heard a man laughing from inside of the cramped, dark, and cluttered attic. She decided to throw all of his possessions away and never heard the man again. 

Another story involving that house has to do with my mother and grandmother. One day they were in the house packing it and preparing for selling it, the tools they were using had gone missing and they could not find them anywhere. They went into the room that use to be my sister's and mine old room and found all the tools laid in the middle of the room neatly stacked on a tarp in the center. They both insisted that they did not move them. 

 The next few stories involve my mom after she had opened herself up to the occult.

 My mother decided to buy a set of tarot cards because she liked the way they looked, that night while she was in bed the bed started to violently shake, my dad of course in all of the occurrences never would wake up and remained fast asleep.

 Another night my mom had these blue orbs fly around the room and get in her face, they terrified her.

 The final story involves my grandmother again. One night when her husband was at work she decided to sleep in. Before her at the end of her bed appeared the floating head of a man, she was terrified and went under her covers, when she looked again the head had taken the shape of a pitch black face. Again she went under the covers to hide, when she surfaced again the head took the form of a pig's head. After this she hopped out of bed and prayed to Jesus and the head went away for good.

 Thank you guys for reading this, I know it is all over the place but I wanted to share most of what I have been told by my family, thanks again!."
"I Just Saw A Full Apparition Ghost!","Washington","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","This morning I was walking upstairs and when I got to the top of the stairs I looked straight ahead and saw what I thought was my 15-year-old daughter walking into the bathroom. I almost said, ""What are you doing up so early?"" and when I approached the bathroom and peered in there was nobody there. Confused I looked into my daughter's bedroom and there she was in bed! 

It was in that moment that I knew I just witnessed my first ever full apparition spirit! It was as real-looking, as solid as any family member walking in our home. Unfortunately I don't recall any facial features or anything other than the white t-shirt he/she was wearing. There's a mirror on the left side of the bathroom once you walk in and what was interesting was the way it walked in the bathroom, it didn't turn and walk right through the door perpendicular from the hallway but angled itself right through the door in such a way it was walking right into the mirror. Hard to describe. It was astonishing! I didn't hallucinate it, I didn't mistake it for anything other than what I saw which was a person/entity wearing a white t-shirt going into the bathroom.

I've seen a lot of shadows and light anomalies in my life that could be spirits, but never have I seen a PHYSICAL apparition before. The solidity of it was what has me most shocked. It wasn't wispy, translucent, it appeared completely SOLID. Who could it be? A doppleganger of my daughter? But she was awake when this occurred. The only other person in the house was my wife and she was in the bedroom and wearing a dark shirt and I would have seen if she walked into the bedroom before I got there and she did not.

I'm both excited and creeped out at the same time!"
"Why I Refuse To Sleep In The Basement","Wisconsin","Haunted Places","My basement has always given me a feeling of fright, so sleeping down there was never an option for me until there was no other option. 

For context, I always felt watched when down there, and there was always an intense feeling of not being alone despite knowing no one else was with you. Well, that no one else alive and breathing was with you. For many years I avoided the basement. I would only go if, at least two others would be with me. I was the type of kid to zoom up the stairs and out of the basement. I still get the feeling of something behind me as I go back up. Currently, I only go into the basement to grab frozen food or to do my laundry. The feeling I've always gotten down there has not left though.

This story takes place in July 2018. I was twelve when it happened. It was a hot summer that year. The air was very humid, and it felt sweltering outside. The air conditioner in our home had recently stopped working, and the house had started to become unbearably hot. The only spot in the house that was cold was the basement, so that is where we had to sleep for a few days. The first few nights were fine. Nothing happened at all until the night before the air conditioner was fixed.

 That night I was struggling to sleep. I'd felt so uncomfortable for absolutely no reason, but I just brushed it off as most twelve-year-olds would. I went to bed at 12ish that night. After what felt like seconds, I awoke abruptly. I remember sitting up and looking towards the small space under the stairs that lead into a storage room. I saw a figure slowly gliding towards me from the stair space. I don't remember exactly how this figure looked, but I remember it being black, solid, and its shape reminded me of a blob. I remember closing my eyes after that, but that's all I can remember of that one. I assume I had fallen back asleep. Once again, I wake up abruptly after what felt like minutes of sleep. This time, instead of looking at the darkest spot, I looked at the laundry room entryway. I thought, if I looked towards the most lit-up area, then I wouldn't see anything scary.

 Thinking about it now, I don't see it as scary, but younger me sure did. Instead of seeing an empty doorway, I saw another blob-like figure. It was almost like that last one, except this one was pure white and had black spots for eyes. It was solid white. You couldn't see anything through it. No light seemed to pass through either, but it didn't have a shadow. Like the last one, it seemed to glide towards me. Before it could get even 6 ft away from me, I hid under my blanket. I fell asleep almost instantly after. I slept the rest of the night. 

The next morning I grabbed all my stuff and headed upstairs. Ever since then, I have not slept in the basement."
"Personal Experiences And Ability Issues","Mississippi","Psychic / Medium","First, I'd like to say thank you for reading, second this story will contain multiple experiences over the course of my life. I'm an empath it's a gift a few on my mother's side have as well. Even as a child I could feel and take on others emotions. 

The earliest I guess paranormal event was when I was four. I had woken up late one night to use the restroom. While headed back to my room I heard the unmistakable squeak of a kitchen cabinets. I figured one of my sister's was up so I went to see. When I got to the cabinet no one was there. The cabinet was still open, as I was looking around the cabinet closed in front of me with a hard slam. I'd pass it off as a bad dream had I not kicked a living room table while sprinting back to my room and hurt my foot.

I'm going to skip a head a few years to when I was twelve now. Only because these are the most that stand out as far as paranormal.

I had a friend named Jillian. She and I would do some crazy things then again we were young and kind of stupid. We found an old shed in the woods while playing one day. We were curious and went to check it out. Before we got in though I grabbed Jillian and said we need to go now. I've never told her but I got a feeling of being watched and just pure cold terror filled me so we booked it back home and never went back.

I'm going to skip a head a few years again to when I'm 24.

I'd been a construction worker for about 3 to 4 years at this time. Something I find very odd is in three different houses miles apart I've had the same unexplained illness symptoms. For context two were remodels for houses built in the early fifties and one was a newly constructed home. As soon as I get out of the truck I'm hit with a feeling of being watched, light headedness, a head ache, feeling sick like close to vomiting, and weak in the knees to the point of collapsing. This has only happened those three occasions. It did wear off after an hour or two but I had to force myself to continue working through it. 

If possible I'd also like some advice on how to limit or turn off my ability at times. While it does help when your the basic shoulder to cry on for several friends it's also exhausting at times."
"Wth Case Files","Illinois","Haunted Places","I think everyone has experienced that odd happening of weirdness that leaves you scratching your head and wondering. Sometimes it's a one off 'you blinked' experience, sometimes it goes on for several days or weeks, always evading any logical explanation, but yet not quite 'ghost story' material. 

For your perusal here are several of my own most recent WTH Files:

Christmas Eve, early morning, 2020. It's a cold morning, 24F with a 'feels like' of -20. I was sipping coffee in the sunroom and looking out at nothing particular, when an iridescent, golf ball sized soap bubble came trolling past the second story windows I'm looking through. I'd say 'floated' but that would be wrong - it was traveling at an extremely slow rate in a horizontal line. I didn't detect any propellers or form of propulsion. It was moving like a Sunday driver taking in the scenery. It settled on the edge of the garage roof next door for perhaps 6 seconds before shooting straight up at an alarming rate of speed and disappearing. 

I've no idea what it was, but it was very pretty.

January 29, 2021 Several WTHs took place that day. I was working on a project and my utility knife disappeared. I had not left the area, but it was gone. A day or so later I hear something strike the kitchen floor (I wasn't working in that room), and there laid the knife.

 I pressed pause on the TV remote and went to the restroom. I hear the TV unpause itself, then go quiet again. When I came out the movie though paused was on a totally different scene.

 I was in the Livingroom and heard the sound of dishes being moved, you know that clinking sound they make, and honestly my first thought was that my cat might be chasing something over the sink. I admit, I was being lazy and hadn't emptied the drainer yet. Rounding the corner and seeing that they'd been stacked and ready to put away... Well, though similar has happened before, I don't think I'll ever be use to it.

March 4-7,2021 My vintage clock radio became possessed. It's from the 80s. It began turning itself on and off, even changing channels. There didn't seem to be a pattern - no time frame or anything like that. It would just click on at random times. It stopped as suddenly as it started.

April 5, 2021 I'm in bed on my left side with my cat curled up against my shoulder, purring loudly. I had barely laid down, so I wasn't even part asleep yet, when I felt another cat walking around and kneading down by my feet. Except, I only have the one cat."
"Hunchback Ghost (s)","New York","Haunted Places","My first experience occurred about 3 years ago, when I was 24. I was working at a facility for mentally disabled individuals where one of the residents had previously died. The people who worked the overnight shifts at my job used to tell stories about seeing the resident's ghost. I personally did not believe in ghosts prior to this.

 3 years in I switched to the overnight position. A few months in, I was relaxing on the couch watching tv at approximately 3am. We usually settle down to nap ourselves around this time. Wide awake, I decided I'd give laying down a shot. I got up, turned off the light, and walked toward the couch.

When I sat on it, I instantly looked up at a shadow man that was hunched over peering at me. The second he saw I was looking at him, he turned and walked away. Frozen in fear, I knew what I had just witnessed was not my eyes playing tricks on me. After about 5 seconds of being petrified, I fumbled to open my phone and shine the flashlight where the man just stood. This man was short, around 5 foot 2 inches, and heavy set. Keep in mind, I had never met the man who previously died.

I was used to getting attacked by mental patients at that job, so my bravery was at an all-time high at that period in my life. Still scared, I peered into the kitchen where he was standing, and nobody was there. In fact, he walked toward a part of the kitchen that he wouldn't have been able to escape from.

I checked on my coworker, who was fast asleep on a couch in a different room. I didn't want to wake her, so I turned on all of the lights besides the one in her room, and laid down on my couch, wide awake and scared.

When she woke up, I told her what I had seen. The scary part was, I didn't even finish describing him, before she FINISHED describing him! That's when I knew that maybe those ghost stories were true after all. The one thing that she was surprised about though, was that he was hunched over.

I quit that job 2 months after this occurred, with this not being the primary reason but it pushed me to actually get a job in the field I wanted to work in (veterinary care).

Fast forward to yesterday. We are staying at my girlfriend's childhood home for the next week to celebrate Easter with her family. My girlfriend's father who was about the same height as the ghost I had seen 3 years ago had died before I met him. Well, it was late at night and I thought I may have seen a hunched over man in the hallway. 

It happened quick, and I thought it may have been my eyes playing tricks on me. I didn't tell anyone because I wasn't sure that it was significant. This man wasn't close and it's quite possible it indeed was my eyes playing tricks on me.

HOWEVER. Just before writing this, I am sitting on their couch at 12:30am scrolling through social media. They have this mirror that peers into the room I'm in, and the light in my room shines directly at the mirror and glares back at me. Something just blocked the light long enough for it to flicker in my peripheral. Again, I'm HOPING that this was another trick, but this one put a good fear in me.

I'm just curious why they would both be hunched over when neither of them were hunched over before they passed away."
"Possible Non Human Intelligence Contact In 1997-ghostly Hand Squeezes Mine As A Child Part 2","Washington","Non Human Entities","Forgive the long story as I am going to use it as a sort of ""Catch All"" for several experiences that tend to be related. As stated in my other stories published, I have had paranormal experiences for much of my life. I have especially been drawn to the UFO/ET phenomenon ever since I can remember. When other children my age were flipping through pages of Dr. Seuss, I was enthralled by page after page of black and white photos of UFOs. There was a strange passion I couldn't consciously quantify that would be a driving force throughout my adult life.

My first UFO sighting came in my teens in the 1980s. I live in the Pacific Northwest and have visual access to Mt. Rainier in most areas in my region. One bright sunny day I noticed a flash of light that caught my eye. I looked towards Mt. Rainier and there was this massive ball of what looked like flames. At first I thought I was witnessing a rare and powerful daylight meteor but this was too large and traveling too slowly to be a meteor. It just chugged along for what seemed like minutes. From that point on I have seen multiple UFO sightings ranging from intriguing balls of light in the sky to chrome-looking stationary balls hovering over the Boeing Aerospace facility in the valley.

In one frightening sighting I was traveling from New Jersey back to my home in Washington on a Continental flight. I spotted these lights in the far distance that seemed to be moving parallel with our plane. As we began our descent into SeaTac Airport, the lights began to fly towards us. Due to the cloudy/foggy conditions I couldn't make out anything but as it got (too) close the lights took on a V or delta configuration, and flew right behind us. I thought for sure it was going to hit us and my life would come to an end under mysterious circumstances.

My obsession with UFOs and ETs was at this point insatiable. I couldn't get enough. I would fantasize about being one of the ""lucky ones"" who would be brought aboard a space craft and interact with a Non-Human Intelligence. Not the negative, probing ones mind-you, but the ones who seemed technologically AND spiritually advanced. In 1997 I finally made conscious contact with what I believe was a Non-Human Intelligence.

I was living alone at the time in an apartment. I had just gotten up from bed to go to the bathroom. I came back and laid on my back and that was when I saw it.

Although it was dark out, there was soft moon light shining in from my blinds which made the room just light enough to discern shadows and shapes. For instance, I had a TV at the foot of my bed and I could clearly see its outline in this light. There, directly in front of the TV was what appeared to be a large bald head. My fight or flight instincts instantly kicked in and my heart began to race and panic was imminent. I quickly discerned I was unable to move. To this day I am unclear if it was due to such an adrenaline rush of fear in my system or if something external was causing this immobility.

Suddenly, this ""Being"" floated over to my side of the bed. It did not walk, it did not jaunt, it floated. I was completely and utterly besides myself. All these years of hoping to be contacted here I was, wide awake, with something clearly not human, inches from me and it was everything I could do to not scream. Be careful what you wish for they say.

Suddenly, this being took my hand and gently squeezed. The last thing I remember in that moment was the feel of its hand was neither warm nor cold to the touch, but felt like someone who was wearing surgical gloves. I'll never forget that. Suddenly I was transported to the moment when I was a small child in my bed, with my hand dangling over the side and something squeezed it which caused me scream out in sheer terror. (I wrote about that experience titled ""Ghostly Hand Squeezes Mine As A Child""). From there, the next thing I literally recall is waking up in the morning, fully light outside.

Of course bravery comes in retrospect as I suddenly wished I had engaged the entity with conversation. I do not consciously recall if it spoke to me in any way. The only thing I recall after my hand was squeezed was that memory of being a child. It was also around this time that I woke in the morning with the word ""AROS"" in huge, red block letters in my mind's eye. I had never experienced anything so clearly like that in my life. I spent years trying to look up the meaning for it but never could to my satisfaction. I finally came to the conclusion it is my real name, as in my real spiritual name. I have been using it as my online handle ever since.

A year or so later I attended a psychic fair in Seattle. I had a reading done and this psychic accurately mentioned my contact experience to me without me saying anything. She said that it came from the ""White Brotherhood"" which I immediately took some offense to as it sounded like some racist organization, LOL! She insisted it was anything but. I later did some research and discovered there is allegedly such an advanced species with that title overlooking humanity. Is that who made contact with me in 1997? Was that the same being or entity that grasped my hand as a small child? Was it trying to tell me it was always with me?

I may never get the answers to these questions until my physical body dies and my Soul moves back Home where remembrance and knowledge is currency. However, I'll never stop trying to find these answers before my time ends in this lifetime. I hope that one day I will remember who AROS really is, and I hope that moment will be filled with joy."
"Floor Squeaker #1","Washington","Haunted Places","I had my first floor squeaker encounter early one morning, sitting on my living room couch while I was recovering from back surgery. I had staples in my low back, and laying down was painful with one of the staples already partially popping out. I had to sleep sitting straight up the first couple of nights.

 It was early in the morning and I was watching TV (about 12 feet in front of me) very quietly. From where I was sitting, right of the TV led to the hallway heading towards our bedrooms. I suddenly heard the floor squeaking, sounding like it was coming from near our bedroom at very end of the hallway. Our floor was carpeted and didn't squeak and I was over 200lbs at that time. It was moving with purpose, 4 more steps and I felt it cleared the hall, and saw it wasn't my wife. Two more floor squeaks and I felt this invisible heavyweight spirit just passed in front of the TV, and was heading to the opposite side of the couch I was sitting on. My heart was pounding and 3 or 4 more quick loud squeaks, and it stopped directly behind me on the couch, over my right shoulder.

 I quickly snapped my head back, looking upwards to see nothing behind me. I know it saw the fear or surprise in my face, and it knew it scared the crap out of me. While it was very noisy coming towards me, it made no noise walking away from me, or however it left. And I just sat there, and did nothing. I told my wife about the floor squeaker when she got up. She thought maybe the pain medication was messing with my brain. I explained to her I had already stopped taking the pain pills as they did nothing for me, and I'm not a pill taker. I was also wide awake. This encounter was at the same home as the mirrored hallway. (Typed and edited by wife)"
"A Series Of Paranormal Events Pt. 2","Arizona","A Haunted Life","I have finally gathered my thoughts enough to get to writing a part two for you all. However, some of these next encounters are my close friend's as well. I might not be able to get them all into one story, but there will definitely be more parts.

Now, let me give you a little bit of background info on my friend before I continue. To start off, she is a Wiccan and has always been open to spirits and other things of that nature. So for the first of her stories, we live about 30 or so minutes away from a popular tourist attraction. The road down is a little bit windy and quite dark at night as there are very few street lights down that way. I'm not going to say much about the location as I don't want to give my location away for my safety. Another thing to note about this road is that after a certain part at night, people in the local car groups love to speed and drift down that road. Admittedly, it is a really nice area to do such. 

Anyway, my friend went for a drive down there one night to clear her head. On the way down, she was on the phone with a friend on speaker in her car. The phone signal as you get closer to the gate at the end gets worse and worse and as a result, the call got disconnected. She immediately tried calling back but got nothing but static. She immediately felt unsafe and turned around. When she got closer to the main road, she called the friend again and asked what happened when she tried calling back earlier. He told her that she didn't call back at all. He sent a screenshot of his call logs and the second call was not there whereas in her screenshots, the second call was there. 

This next part is going to be one of my personal accounts. Back in December of 2020, I was driving down a relatively popular scenic mountain road while killing time before I had to pick up my roommate from the airport. If you haven't been able to tell so far, my friends and I do a lot of ""recreational"" driving. To continue, I was at about the halfway mark between the start of the trail and the end, give or take a few miles. It was about 9:30 pm and I was the only one on the road. Nobody in front of me, nobody behind me. If there was, it was a significant distance to where I wasn't able to see them. I had my high beams on, as it was safe to do so, and I briefly saw a woman in a very strange white dress walking on the right side of the road facing away from me. As I mentioned in my first story, when I say I see things, I mean they are visible in my mind's eye. The woman's dress looked like a very thick off-white material (picture the outfit Baby Yoda wears) with sandals and dishwater blonde hair. Her head was pointed downward and away from me. I know it wasn't physically there because once I blinked, the woman was gone. Believe it or not, Arizona gets pretty cold in the winter. It was borderline freezing that night so the sandals didn't make any sense to me. And no, I don't live in Flagstaff or anywhere that regularly gets snow. 

That's it for now. Thank you all so much for reading and I'm sorry for how wordy it was. I'd love to hear your thoughts about both encounters."
"The Black Figure And The Pigeon","Washington","Haunted Places","This experience happened near Spokane, Washington in the early fall month of September in 2020. MY fellow user on here who goes by easyforcheez and has already submitted one of our experiences before, (which was the ball that started all of these experiences and problems) decided to go for a drive which is all there really is to do where we live. Since I had recently bought my first big purchase as an adult, my own car, we decided to take it to do the driving around to really break it in to our routine. 

 We have had experiences since we were about 16 and 17 (we were 23 and 24 in this story) we try to go into these drives and time together with a clear and bright mind set to hopefully push away any bad omens or entities. Well this night it was around 11 pm and we were driving on the old highway outside our town which happens to lead to our town's main cemetery, and we were jokingly discussing that because my car was new and shiny, that something would attach itself to my car, just wait and see. It was rather immediately after we jokingly made that one comment that we got an immense pressure in our chests and the further we went North on the old highway we got a feeling that all we can explain as being a ""GET OUT NOW!"" feeling. So rather than not listen to this feeling and pressure (like we have done many other times in the past,) we turned right around and drove through town and stayed there in well lit and well populated areas for around thirty minutes. 

It was after the thirty minutes we decided we were just being wimps and overreacting since we have had a lot of experiences and some of them being even worse experiences in the past. We decided that we would continue on our drive and head back the way we were going, North of town and overcome the fear and feelings we had. It was around 11:30 pm at this time and as we headed out of town the feelings began again but we decided to push through. About two miles outside of the city limits next to a speed limit sign we saw a little perfect pigeon. As it was the first time we had passed this little pigeon we figured that the little fella just got tired of flying or might have been hurt and just left it be and continued driving. As we headed back towards town for the second time we noticed the little pigeon was still there, no movement, not even an inch facing the same direction almost eerily fake seeming. So we figured it was fake and it was just placed there by someone as a joke. We again continued on and did our loop again, on our third time heading North we decided screw it, we would stop on our way back and stop and check out the little pigeon. We stopped right next to it and did everything we could to startle it to get any reaction out of it (flashing our phones lights at it, honking my horn like crazy, etc.) but still nothing it didn't even so much as twitch with any of our efforts. So we upped the efforts and rolled down the windows to talk to/yell at the pigeon. It was at this moment that the extreme pressure and immense feeling of all out GET OUT NOW! GOOOOO! Came back tenfold and the pigeon almost with robotic like reflexes jerked his head to face us as his body faced forwards and he just stared at us. I'm going to be honest we froze for a second and then I floored it to get the heck out of there because when the pigeon moved his head we knew without a shadow of doubt there was seriously something wrong with and around the pigeon that was unsafe. After this night we didn't take this route of our routine drives for weeks and stayed away from this area outright. We still felt a feeling of danger and discomfort while driving in our little town and took us forever to feel comfortable to drive home for me to drop her off. I made sure she got in the door safely and she called me for the very short drive home and the walk to get into my house because we didn't feel safe otherwise. 

Now I know that the part you just read for this experience was long and extensive and hopefully I still have your attention because this next part is what scares us the most and possibly the most important to our story and experience.

 This happened on 3/24/2021 (I give an exact date because I don't know when you're reading this and when the story is approved by moderators.) It was on this night as we sat in front of her house playing Among Us and discussing different things, such as the story easyforcheez posted on her account on here and wondering if any new comments or thoughts had been shared on the post, we discussed posting/sharing some of our other stories and experiences to hopefully get some feedback and maybe some help to figure out what could be going on in our life.

 We discussed the experience I described above and even repeated the comment we had made before we began that almost fateful drive ""watch us get something attached to your brand new car!) At this point I looked over towards my car since we were in her car and immediately saw a dark and ominous and honestly terrifying figure sitting in the driver's seat of my car. I again had the feeling of GET OUT NOW! LEAVE NOW! Come over me again, so instead of alarming easyforcheez I suggested how about we do one more loop around just the town. When we hit main street on a really lit street I told her what I saw and why I told her to leave and do a loop.

 Even when we finally got back to her house and ultimately my car we still had a very uncomfortable and unsafe feeling, especially when we opened the doors on my car to inspect it to make sure nobody and nothing was in there I had a horrible pressure like something was pressing down on my chest making it extremely difficult to breathe and made me scared to even drive my car home. Easyforcheez even had a unwell and seemingly weird feeling come over her.

 Now I don't know why this happened or why there is a connection to the event from last night and the event from September but we know they are connected. This is where you guys come in, does anyone have any clues or thoughts or maybe even ways to cleanse the car and the area around her house for our safety because as I write this it is broad sunny daylight and I still don't feel comfortable."
"Protective Spirit","Florida","Haunted Places","This encounter was told to me by my sister, Anna. She had a friend named Julie that confided in her that strange things were happening in her home. Julie and her husband had moved in one year before. 

They had two children, Miles who was five and Sean who just turned one. 

Julie said that she and her husband were hearing noises at night. At first they ignored it. Putting it off to the house being old. But then things quickly got worse. The noises happened more often. Things flew off tables, and Miles began having night terrors. 

Julie wanted to get someone to come in and figure out what was going on, but the husband refused. Didn't believe in things like that. Not knowing what to do she waited it out. Two weeks later Julie was home alone, the kids were in bed, and her husband had to work until 1 am. Too scared to be alone she asked my sister, Anna, to stay with her.

My sister noticed that Julie was close to tears, and asked her if she was alright. 

She shook her head no. 

She said Miles would sometimes stare at nothing. That he was too scared to go into the kitchen were most of the activity was and he would stand outside Sean's room at night. When she asked Miles why he was standing in his baby brother's doorway, he said, he was protecting Sean from the bad man.

When she asked what bad man? He said, ""The one who throws things."" The hair on the back of her neck stood up. 

She asked him, ""Do you see the bad man?"" He nodded his head, and pointed at the corner in the hall. She went pale. ""I didn't know what to do so I turned Miles around and put him back to bed."" My sister asked Julie when that happen. She said ""Last night."" 

Both women heard noises for hours and my sister's water bottle flew off the table twice. My sister said it gave her the creeps.

It was 1:30 when Julie's husband came home. She went to check on the kids as my sister gathered her things to leave. Both my sister and Julie's husband heard a scream. Both of them ran to find Julie standing in the doorway to Sean's room. They all were looking at something that was hovering near the baby. It seemed to float back and forth in front of the crib. Then it looked at them and it disappeared. Julie's husband quickly grabbed the baby and and the family left for the night.

Julie's husband finally let someone in to find out what was going on. They were told that the poltergeist in the kitchen was someone who had died there at least 30 years ago. He was an old man that was named John. He was angry. And in life as well as death was not a nice man. 

The also said the woman they saw in the baby's room was protecting the baby from the other spirit. She was of no danger to them, as to who she was they could not say, just that she meant no harm. My sister asked about Miles seeing this man. They told them sometimes young children can see spirits.

The family move three months after that."
"Ghostly Hand Squeezes Mine As A Child","Washington","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I have already posted two stories that occurred to me when I was an adult. This memory involves when I was a child, perhaps 4 years old or around there. Some of my earliest memories involve frightening imagery of shadow people moving about our house. I didn't know who or what they were, just that they weren't part of our family. I remember becoming so terrified I recall times where my mom would have to put me on her lap and rock me until I calmed down. One of the clearest memories was of waking up and looking down our long hallway (my bedroom door was open) and seeing this very distinct, very large, dark figure just standing there. I couldn't make out any face or facial details but I knew it was staring straight at me. I don't recall what happened after that but that memory has always remained strong even to this day, not like a dream memory but an actual lucid, waking memory.

So paranormal-type of activity was heavy from around the age of 3 until about 5 or 6 if I had to guess. It was during this time when the ghostly hand squeezed mine. I can remember this like it was literally yesterday. I had gone to bed and I remember being unable to fall asleep. I was on my stomach with my right arm dangling over the bedside (the opposite side of the bed was against a wall). My hand was drooped downward. Suddenly someone...Something, took ahold of my hand and gently squeezed.

As you can imagine, I let out the most blood-curdling scream a small child could muster! My parents were at my bedroom door within seconds asking me what was wrong? Of course and predictably, I said there was a monster under my bed and as you can imagine, they patronizingly checked under my bed, found nothing and told me it was just a bad dream and to go back to bed.

My protesting to the contrary fell on deaf ears. There was nothing I could do but stay in my bed, petrified until dawn and that's precisely what I did. The feeling of the fleshy hand was as real as any hand I have ever shook or held in my lifetime. It wasn't cold, it was warm and the squeeze was very gentle, not in any way aggressive. There was a contact event that took place years later, truly a story on its own, in 1997 that may explain the source but that experience doesn't seem to fit on this website (more ET-related). 

To this day, even as a 52-year-old man, I still won't dangle my arm/hand over the side of a bed at night."
"The White Face On The Celling","Indiana","Haunted Places","So a little background; my room is always cold but we just blamed it on the fact that I only have 1 vent leading to my room. But now that I think about it I believe that not the reason. I have always had an overactive imagination so when it comes to seeing things my parents dismiss it saying it's all in my head. But last night I caught something on camera. 

 I had this strange feeling that something or someone was watching me from above, I ignored it for a bit but then it got to the point where I could not fall asleep. So I turned on my camera and started recording my ceiling: I have 8-foot ceilings because I live in the garage that was remodeled into two bedrooms. After a little bit, I stopped the recording and looked over the video. And there right above me was a white face. I instantly turned on my light but there was nothing there that could have created the face I saw. 

 I decided to sleep in a different room so that I would not be bothered but today, while I was cleaning my room I would feel someone tapping my shoulder or poking my back. I knew I was alone in my room because I was facing my door so no one would have walked in behind me without me knowing. I dismissed the taps until I started hearing coughs or sneezes behind me.

 This is not the first time I have felt that something was with me when I was alone but this was the first time I knew something was there. I'm too scared to sleep in my room tonight in fear that things might escalate. And I don't know if the Entity is attached to the room or me."
"The Girl In White","New Jersey","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","It's been a while. As I've said before in my story ""There's something in your room"" I've had many paranormal experiences. I believe I should speak of another, especially as it's a recent recurring event.

I'm sure many of you have heard of the Dead Girl game. If you haven't, it's a game where you would close your eyes, and snap your left fingers a specific amount of time, and stomp your right foot that amount of time... Each time counting down 10,5,3,1. After that, you would hold out both of your arms in front of you while saying, ""Dead girl, dead girl, raise my hands until I die."" 

I was introduced to the game during my 6th year in school (2016). Normally, I figured the girls in my class were just messing around with me, as they would seem to be moving their own hands. I figured this because they weren't the least freaked out at the ""touches"", and their hands were moving too ""fast"". Yet however, every time I played the game, my hands would move, and there would be a light pressure on my hands. As you know, if you hold your hands out for about 5 mins, it would get heavy, well this was not the case, your hands would keep getting lighter by the min, and you can feel them rising.

There was a rule you also had to follow with the game. Your hands could not pass above your head, or you will die. One day during recess, I was playing the game, and a few girls were standing around me. As I followed the steps and started the game, I felt one of the girls touch my hand. I told them to leave my hands, they did, and they all walked away from me. I started experimenting with the question and asking her questions like Do you want to kill me, or will you be my friend, asking her to lower my hands if no, and raise it if yes. She said no to killing me and yes to being my friend. A few minutes later, (my eyes were still closed) I saw the outline of a little girl standing in front of me, lightly holding my hands up. I started panicking and quickly opened my eyes. I looked around at all the other students heading inside. I dismissed the situation, and never spoke of it.

During my 8th year (2018), I started encountering this girl again. Once during lunch, I was looking into the bathroom mirror, when I saw her standing behind me. I turned around thinking it was one of the younger students. There was no one behind me. I turned back to the mirror and she was there. She had long black hair, with blue eyes, and she was wearing a blood stained white dress. After a few minutes she left, and I walked out of the bathroom. I told my friends about the incident, but they only laughed and said I was making up the story.

Often I would see her around the school. My friends said I would go red, and would just be staring at a random spot every time I saw her around. Many nights I would see her in my dreams, and once I even saw her standing in my room. She never made an attempt to speak to me or to hurt me. She'd just stand there, her hands by her side staring. 

I hadn't seen her for over 2 years. A few weeks ago (Feb 2021), I started noticing her around me again. She would mostly show herself in mirrors, or glass reflections. She often come nearer to me than before. A few times I've heard the laughter of a child. This often calms me. She seems nice, and playful, and often when I am upset, she would be around. Always making funny faces in the glass or mirrors. I would often feel better after this. I have noticed she looks a lot like me, so I think of her as a younger sister. My parents told me my mother was pregnant before she died, so this makes me think of her more of a sibling. 

Thank you for reading about my experience."
"She Kept On Teaching","South Carolina","Haunted Places","There is another story on here that originated out of my little Podunk town of Ware Shoals, but this one is a lot more recent. Our schools did some rearranging in 2014 and the tiny two story building next to our high school that had been the junior high for many years was transformed into our new district administration building. They put all the administrative office rooms on the second or lower floor and the top floor was nothing but unused classrooms, except for one. It was our home economics room that had four little mini kitchens each with their own sets of kitchen cooking utensils and stoves. Our home economics teacher, who we will call Mrs. A, also taught other electives like child development. 

I was a junior in 2015, or about to be, and I had taken Mrs. A cooking and nutrition class and her child development class the year before. Which was the first year that building was being used with the upper floor completely empty. But it didn't have an eerie atmosphere because Mrs. A was always out in the hall greeting us as we came in. I was signed up to take her child development two class that year and it was about a week or two before school was due to start when we all got the news that she had tragically passed away the day before. Out of nowhere. All of her classes were cancelled and a new computer class was created to put her students in that had signed up for her classes that year. The room was left empty except for all the stoves and cabinets. The pots, pans, and sewing machines were donated. 

To get to the administrative offices from the high school you have to go into the top floor of the old junior high building and down the stair just to the right of the door. It was about four months into my junior year when one of the senior office workers, who was also a fellow band member of mine, told me about what happened. One of her friends and fellow office workers was asked to take some paper work to one of the district administrators in the ""district office"". The worker took the papers and went about her way down to the second floor of the high school and into the top floor of the junior high. 

This student had just stepped onto the first step of the stairs when she heard it. The sound of someone banging pots and pans around as if they were rearranging or cooking. She felt an eerie feeling, like you get in an empty building, pass over her. A feeling no one had ever gotten in that building before. She could swear it was coming from the home economics room where Mrs. A had taught since she became the home economics teacher several years before. But no one had been in that room and it had been locked when school started. We all wrote it off as one thing or another because we had enough ""ghosts"" haunting our high school. We didn't need one more.

Then about three months after that, I was sent down to offices in the building by my band director to take a list of parents due for a background check so they could continue to chaperone for the band program at contests and such. The room was confirmed as clear of pots and pans at this point and had still been locked since the beginning of school. No one had been in or out of it and all the stoves were unplugged. Giving the aforementioned office worker a little credibility. As I walked into the top floor, I could hear the faint sounds of someone upstairs but I pegged it as a janitor or maintenance person since the school used the empty classrooms for storage. 

But as I stepped down onto the stairs to go downstairs, the sound got louder and I recognized it from my time in home economics as the sound of pots and pans banging around. Along with that sound I could swear I recognized the sound of sewing machines going and my mother had sewed for as long as I could remember so I knew the sound quite well. An eerie feeling came over me and I went down the stairs as quick as I could. When I came back up the sounds were gone, but I could smell freshly baked cupcakes as if I was eating them. I left the building like someone had lit a fire under my heels and I never went in the upper floor again. 

They say when someone dies an unexpected or violent death, they linger in our world. So to me, that teacher who was meant to teach that year went on teaching like normal. If you ask anyone still at that school (I graduated almost four years ago) who has been on the top floor of that building during the school year, one or two will tell you they heard it too. The sounds of someone in that room cooking or sewing. As if Mrs. A is still there. 

She never left."
"Father Points Out Missing Life Insurance Policy After Death","Washington","Family / Friends Visits","It was 1991 and my father was killed in a car accident just 6 months after my sister was also killed in a car accident (My first story was published on that recently). This time of my life understandably was much like being surrounded in a persistent fog. I was staying with my mom at the time and we were actively looking for a life insurance policy from my father. They had been divorced for many years and my dad lived alone and let's just say he wasn't the most organized man on the planet.

My mom swore she recalled a phone conversation once telling her that he had taken out a life insurance policy for the kids (my sister and I). This was years ago, like early 1980's. We both pondered, what on earth would be the chances that he would have kept up that policy for all of those years? Still, we kept looking, almost to just distract us more than anything from the numbing pain of sudden loss at that time in our lives. One day, my mom found a piece of paper that showed a policy but it was dated like 1982 or something like that. I said maybe that's it? But we both thought, again, the chances that would still be an active policy was severely unlikely. We both pretty much put it out of our minds and went on with our lives the best we could.

Then one morning while I was sleeping, I had a lucid dream. I ""awoke"" (still dreaming) and there was my dad. Standing next to my bed looking very, very much alive and at peace. He smiled and motioned me to follow him downstairs which I did. He proceeded to walk over to my mom's purse, picked it up, put his hand inside and brought out a piece of paper. It was that very policy! He looked at me with a big smile and that is when I woke up.

Knowing a contact dream when it happens, I bounced out of bed, ran downstairs where my mom was in the kitchen making breakfast and I excitedly told her dad just visited me and showed me that policy in her purse was in fact the policy we had been looking for! My mom, probably at the time assuming I was just having a dream, nothing more, nothing less, shrugged her shoulders and only after much prodding finally agreed to make some calls on Monday (this happened over a weekend).

I KNEW it was going to be a valid policy. That was NOT just a dream. Every detail in the dream was so incredibly vivid, unlike most dreams that tend to be quite fluid and blurry around the edges. My father had come to me to lend a hand, and that he did.

When my mom finally made the phone call it was in fact confirmed. 

The policy was active. Inexplicably still valid after all of those years."
"Black Suit, Top Hat Ghost?","Texas","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I was about 6 or 7 when this happened. It was a very bright morning and I had just woken up. When I looked to my side I saw a tall man in a black suit and a top hat. I have a very clear vision of him except for his face, he looked perfectly normal, if you were to see him on the street you wouldn't think much of it. He had ginger hair, a shaved beard and he looked to be in his 20's. 

He was simply staring at me as I was sleeping so, of course, I was shocked but before I could react he disappeared. 

Some notes worth mentioning:

1) I was sharing a room with my older brother at the time. (who is 2 years older than me) He was awake on his phone and didn't see a thing, I never told him but if a man was there it'd be hard to miss.

2) I'm sure it wasn't a dream because I went on with my day normally and didn't wake up again or anything like that.

3) My older sister has seen a woman sitting on the toilet once (just sitting not doing potty matters) and I've felt many presences in this house in certain areas for years. My mom does believe me, she has tried holy water and getting help to get rid of whatever is here but it never helps.

4) I'm an extremely paranoid person and having the feeling of being watched only makes it worse, plus it lowers my self-esteem more and more. I can't even feel comfortable while I'm alone because I feel like I'm being watched.

5) My friend suggested I try to find information on my house to see if it has any past history of hauntings but I found nothing. (This house is about 20 years old) 

SIMILAR EXPERIENCES:

I also did some research on people who have had similar experiences with a ""black suit/top hat man"" and everyone's experiences are negative. He didn't harm me but my experience is similar to others such as his dressing, he appeared while I was sleeping, and he looked like a normal human."
"Sister Phones Me After Killed In Car Accident","New York","Family / Friends Visits","In December of 1990 I was living in New York City trying to make it in the rock music industry. The last time I saw my sister, D'Lea (pronounced ""Duh-Lee""), was the year before when she visited us. One morning as I was getting ready for my day job I received the phone call no brother ever wants to receive. It was my mother saying three words I will never forget.

""Todd, she's gone.""

And so began my new life. The life where my beautiful sister was no longer on this earth. D'Lea was one of those rare people that everyone loved. She had an incredibly caring Soul. I know we tend to only remember the positives about people and conveniently forget the negatives when a person dies, but I can honestly say my sister didn't have very many negative qualities. She was a soft, sweet, caring Soul that was apparently only meant to walk this earth for 25 years in this incarnation.

She cared deeply for me and nurtured me almost like a second mom. We were very close. We had both grown up in an abusive home after our parents divorced and when my mother remarried, our teen years were spent in a volatile home thanks to our step dad.

Which is why it wasn't any surprise (looking back now) that even in death she wanted to take care of me by letting me know she was okay. Now at the time I didn't know who was trying to call. It all started when I was alone in the apartment one night, not long after her accident. It was exactly 12:00AM when the phone rang. (I know this because I had a digital clock next to me with those big red digital display numbers).

I picked it up and heard what sounded like this loud white noise. Like TV static back in the day when you would turn the channel and it was just a static screen. ""Hello? Hello?"" Nothing. Not thinking much of it, I hung up and went back to bed. Then the phone rang again. I looked at the clock. 12:15AM. Same thing, loud static. Living in NYC at the time I started thinking maybe it was a band mate calling from a subway station and a subway was going by as they called. But I never did hear anything other than static.

Every time I would go back to bed, like clockwork (literally!), every 15 minutes on the dot, the phone would ring. 12:30AM, 12:45AM, 1:00AM, 1:15AM and so on. At this point, I KNEW it was my sister. Goosebumps came over me in that knowing only you can quantify without knowing how it is you know something. You just do.

This went on at precise 15 minute increments until the final phone call at 3AM. Then it stopped for good.

At the time I didn't know about spirits using the phone sometimes to try to contact loved ones from beyond. Then I came across a book a few years later that described my experience nearly to a tee. I'm not sure why she was unable to make her voice audible above the white noise... Perhaps her Soul was too new to the other dimension and wasn't able to project enough energy. No matter. In the end, I know it was her trying to tell me she was okay.



I had many wonderful contact dreams from her in the following few years after her passing. At one point, I attended a psychic reading with a panel of respected psychics from the North East region of the US. They were providing readings using psychometry. I brought the framed photo D'Lea had given me of herself just a year before she passed. Which if you knew my sister, that in and of itself was incredible as she hated her photo being taken, but inexplicably, she had portraits of herself taken that she gave to her closest family and friends not long before her accident. That alone still blows my mind.

I raised my hand and offered the framed photo to the row of psychics. The information they provided me was nothing short of astounding.

The feeling of cold signifying the person is no longer in the earth realm. 

(Yes) 

The passing was due to a car accident involving a large truck of some sort. 

(Yes, she was killed instantly on a rainy evening coming home and didn't see the semi-truck that was parked half in the road from mechanical trouble) 

It was quick, she showed them ""lights out"" meaning she didn't suffer. 

(True) 

She was with a father figure and they are holding hands. The father figure had heart trouble of some sort causing his death.

(Correct, my father died 6 months after D'Lea in a car accident and we believe it was a broken heart that caused the accident) 

I always gravitated towards the unknown and the paranormal but my interest in spirituality, metaphysics, consciousness and Life after Death didn't accelerate until after they died. In the years since I have had a full blown Awakening and my sister gets all the credit. While I am still struggling with the human part of myself and far from perfect, all of the good within me and my desire to always strive to be a better father, husband, friend, son and man is due to her influence, both while she was still on earth and even now in the afterlife.

The day we are reunited again will be one sweet day indeed."
"Tucking Her In","Washington","Haunted Places","It was the Christmas Holiday season, and one morning when I was just getting home from work and my wife was getting ready to leave for work, she told me that something was tucking her in very gently at night, and thought maybe it was a loved one that had passed. I was surprised and kind of forgot about it until a couple of weeks later, she told me that it happened again, and I tried to keep an open mind. In that house, she slept about 3 feet from the opposing mirrored closet hallway where I had previous spirit experiences. I didn't like thinking about her being visited while I was at work, and tried not to worry.

My work schedule was typically four straight nights, from 6:00pm to 6:00am, and on my 5th night I would change my sleeping hours to sleep with my wife, who usually went to bed around 10:30pm. I usually went to bed by 8:00pm, and would be awake and up between 2-3:00am.

 On one of those nights, I was awakened around 2:30am and both of my feet were being pulled down by a steady pull, at the end of the bed. We left the outside Christmas lights on all night and there was enough light in the room to see our male Yorkie at the end of the bed, looking down at the ground. I immediately sat up and looked over the end of the bed and saw nothing but solid wood to the floor below the covers, as this bed had drawers under it. I'm guessing or thinking that whatever this was had probably slithered from the mirrored hallway. My wife wakes up from my movement, and I tell her that she wasn't kidding and I had just had my feet pulled down slowly at the end of the bed. She then tells me that she has had that also happen to her. Kind of a cool experience.

Second and Last Blanket-Pulling Encounter

It was two days before Christmas and I was off work for the Holidays, so I was home sleeping with my Wife in bed, and laying flat on my back with my feet sticking straight up (my feet are Size 11 and my Wife's are a Size 6, so mine stuck up much higher in the bed and were very close to the edge). It's early a.m. Again, and I am startled awake by extreme pain as my toes are being bent straight down. There was some strength to pull the covers and my feet into the mattress. I immediately pulled my feet back and woke up my wife, this time not getting up and looking over the edge of bed, kind of distressed by it and did not want to know what was pulling on the blanket. Over the next two nights, we decided to take the camera to bed and video-tape to see what we could see.

 It was odd that while we were laying in bed, video-taping towards our feet that our little Yorkie was at the edge of the bed, looking down again. He normally laid right between us at the head of the bed. While filming, we had many dust orbs appear on the camera, but some would come right at us and abruptly change direction. A couple of large orbs came off the bed and shot straight up quickly. Never noticed blanket-puller happening again and hoped it was just a loved one who came around for the Holidays, but we'll never know. (Typed and edited by Wife)"
"The House In Beech Bluff","Tennessee","Haunted Places","I've had a few experiences with the unexplained but this is, by far, the worst paranormal experience I've ever had. (I apologize for the terrible opening) LOL!

 Many years ago, I moved in with a good friend whose house was way out in the sticks of this weird gravel road. My friend did tell me that his house may be haunted because of the history of the house and because of strange things that he saw and heard. He doesn't believe in ghost's and the paranormal as much as I do so he didn't pay much attention to anything moving and any strange sounds.

 The day I moved in he told me about the history of this house. He told me that a family of 3, a Mother, Father, and their Daughter, lived in the house when the house was first built years ago. Their daughter committed suicide in her bedroom upstairs, the only room upstairs. Several years after the Mother and Father moved out of the house, a few families bought and sold the house until my friend's parents bought it as a fixer upper. They began remodeling the house.

 The stairs were removed and the 2nd story was completely sealed off and a drop ceiling was put in to cover the old ceiling and cover the opening to the top floor. His parents were aware of the history of the house so, I assume that was the reason they removed the stairs and installed a drop ceiling. I had never been in a house that had such a strange layout or floorplan. The living room and the 2 bedrooms were in the front of the house. Then dining room was on the other side of the living room wall and the kitchen was behind the dining room at the back of the house. The one bathroom was at the end of a long hallway, that's it, just a long hallway with a bathroom at the end of it.

 Anyway, when I first started noticing little things out of place and odd sounds it was cool and fascinating. We would hear footsteps down the hallway, we could hear things moving, things would fall of the kitchen counters, you know nothing alarming and most of the activity happened in the daytime. But, things started happening more often and it slowly started annoying us.

 The activity was happening day and night. My friend and I started distancing ourselves from the house by partying all night and crashing wherever we passed out. We would stay at our parents or grandparents house's. All of this back and forth from friends house's to parents house's, drinking and partying all the time had me wore out and I needed a break. That's when I decided to head out there alone for some peace and quiet. We hadn't been out there for days and I figured if I watched a movie at a high volume or listen to some music loudly, I wouldn't hear anything and I'd be fine. If I got bored with watching movies or TV I'd go jump on my drumkit and jam out. But, little did I know that the shiat was about to hit the fan. 

 I was sitting there all alone just watching TV. Our TV was hooked up to a stereo so we could watch movies and listen to music as loud as we wanted. So, I'm watching some show and the stereo cuts off. We had an entertainment center that held the TV, the stereo, a few lamps and a clock etc. Suddenly, the stereo cut off but the TV and everything else that was in the entertainment center stayed on even though all of these devices were plugged into the same power strip. Dead silence, I began to hear whispering, like several people whispering at once. The whispering was coming from the kitchen which was at the back of the house. The whispering kept getting louder and louder until I had to go outside to see if the whispering was my mind playing tricks on me.

 It was quiet outside! No whispering! There was a storm coming in so I did hear thunder but no whispering. As soon as I got comfortable I hear the whispering around the side of the house and it was gradually getting louder. Dang! I go back inside. It's quiet inside. Then, BABOOOOOMB! A LOUD AS HELL, CLAP OF THUNDER! IT SCARED THE HECK OUT OF ME!

 After cringing from the tremendous thunder clap, I relax and start down the hall to the bathroom. The hallway always made me uncomfortable. It was a long hallway that went to the bathroom, nothing else. I started down the hallway when I hear this creaking sound directly behind me. As I turned my head I saw, from the corner of my eye, the front door slowly creaking open and something, I can only explain as the fight or flight response, told me to shut the DAMN door NOW! So, I dove towards the door sliding across the floor on my stomach crashing right into the door slamming it. I remember feeling like all of this happened in slow motion. Anyway, I slide across the floor and SLAM, the door shut. I jump up and the most intense feeling that someone or something was right behind me. Ya know, when someone is trying sneak up on you and you get this bizarre feeling that someone or something is behind you I don't know how to describe that feeling but it's not a good feeling. 

 Anyway, it was more than a feeling that something was behind me. WHATEVER IT WAS, IT FELT ANGRY OR ENRAGED AND IT WANTED TO HURT ME! IT HONESTLY FELT LIKE I WAS ABOUT TO BE VIOLENTLY ATTACKED FROM BEHIND BY WHO KNOWS WHAT! THIS FEELING WAS SO INTENSE THAT I CLOSED MY EYE'S, BENT DOWN AND TENSED UP PREPARING FOR THE ATTACK! THEN, NOTHING. THAT FEELING WAS GONE, INSTANTLY. I QUICKLY TURNED AROUND EXPECTING TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF MY ATTACKER ONLY TO SEE NOTHING.

 After realizing that there was nothing behind me, I grabbed my wallet, my hat and my keys and I left! When I came back I came to pack up my belongings and move out. I rented a u-haul so I could get all of my things out of that house in one trip. 

 I've witnessed several paranormal events in my life and this one was the worst. I'm trying my best to share this but it's hard to describe everything in this format. I'm a story teller, so I'd much rather be telling someone a story in person instead of trying to use the right words and punctuation etc.

 All of the other paranormal experiences I've witnessed have not been that bad, but there have been a handful of experiences that weren't cool at all. I will never forget any of the paranormal activity I've witnessed throughout my life. ESPECIALLY THIS ONE..."
"A Sister's Love","Alaska","Family / Friends Visits","My mother told me this story when I was in my teens. I loved hearing stories of the experiences my parents had with my dad being in the Army. But she told me this one was a little spooky and that it involved my older sister. 

In 1963 my father got stationed in Fairbanks, Alaska. It was a big change for them. Both were only 18 years old, recently married and she was pregnant. Things were not easy for them, especially when Dad had to stay on base for weeks at times. Mom didn't drive and sometimes had to take the bus to her prenatal appointments. 

Mom said while pregnant with my sister she sometimes felt that someone was watching her. She started having bad dreams of her dying during child birth. 

About the time Mom was six months along the doctors got concerned. Her stomach was bigger than it should be and it was getting harder for her to even walk. She was stressed and agitated. Tests were taken but they found nothing wrong. Mom still seemed to be having a hard time with it. In April my sister was born, without issues, but Mom was exhausted and told them she still didn't feel well. The doctors put it off to the fact that it was a difficult pregnancy. That night in the hospital she tried to care for my sister but couldn't focus, was nauseated and had a fever. 

Mom said she felt some one stroke her hair and heard her sister's voice say ""It's alright, I will watch the baby."" When she woke up the baby was asleep, and the doctor was asking her if she knew what day it was. He told her they found her in dire straits and a test proved she had a nasty infection and they almost lost her. 

They told her they weren't due to check on her for two more hours and wouldn't have come in if it wasn't for the light going on. The thing is, it was broken, due to be fixed next week. 

Mom also said she felt her sister stroke her hair and heard her voice. 

My mom was 12 years old when her sister died at 17 of polio."
"A Series Of... Paranormal Events?","Arizona","A Haunted Life","My name is Jen. I'm 23 years old and I have always been sensitive to spirits or things of that... Sort. I have many other stories from when I was a kid but I'll save those for another time. Within the last few years, I have experienced multiple, minor things. 

My boyfriend lived in base housing on the local Air Force base. He used to live in a cul-de-sac at the front area of the base. Right where the street rounds off, I have seen an average height Airman, in uniform (ABU's), just standing under the street lights. When I say I see him, I mean that I can see him in my mind's eye. My boyfriend has since moved to another area of base housing but we have friends who live around that area and I always get a little uneasy driving past the street.

 The next sighting I'm going to talk about is just outside of the previously mentioned neighborhood. There is a small thrift shop that was most likely a gas station in previous years along the street leading to the youth center. The outside of the building has a water machine, a soda vending machine, and a RedBox. I tend to go to that RedBox a fair bit to see what they have and the occasional movie rental. This has happened on multiple occasions. I usually head to that RedBox after work at around 7 pm (I work on base) so the sun has already set and it is fairly dark on base. I always see some sort of large shape (unsure if animal or humanoid) run across the parking lot to the far side of the thrift shop building. Once it hits the street light over the dumpster, it disappears. I have checked back there for a possible dog or javelina but there is never anything there. This has happened about three or so times to me. 

The last experience I am going to talk about is still on base but in my opinion, it is one of the most terrifying things I have ever experienced. It was about 1 am and I was going to visit my boyfriend in his hanger while he worked the overnight shift. There is a 4-way stop sign at the very end of the main street that goes straight down the middle of the base. As you get closer to the plane hangers, street lights become few and far between, as it is close to the flight-line. As you can imagine, at 1 am, I am the only one on the road headed that direction. I pulled up to the stop sign and as I did, I saw a man with the most terrified expression on his face as if he was going to get hit by a car out of my drivers' side window. I put my car in park, got out and took a look around my car for someone. I could not find any sign of a person. So I got back into my car and drove off. In all my years of experiences, this was the only time I had been able to see someone's face.

So, yeah. That was first part of my strange experiences. If anyone has any questions or insight on my experiences, I would love to hear it. Thank you so much and I will try to update my stories as soon as I possibly can."
"Refuse To Move On","Oregon","Haunted Places","Since I've moved to the Pacific Northwest my psychic ability has expanded HUGELY! 

It was acutely tested when we stayed at an Historical Hotel in Hood River. The Hotel was built in 1888 & is haunted by the woman who originally owned it, I'll call her Jane. 

The 1st time we stayed Jane walked down the hall & knocked on our door at night. After she'd done it a few times, I sat by the peephole to watch. Seeing nothing but hearing footsteps & knocking... She even turned the doorknob! The 2nd night I heard noise in the room & looked down to see my clothes scattered on the floor. When I sat up, there were footsteps running down the hall. I later found out a few employees hear Jane. Jane's original quarters were just down the hall from our 1st room.

Underneath the hotel is a banquet room that used to be a Saloon and Dance Hall. When I went down there I stood where I was sure there'd been a gunfight. You can almost hear the old time piano and see the railroad workers. The original floor and pillars are still there and it hangs heavy with memories.

The 2nd time we stayed on bottom floor. The 1st night I smelled hay & I could hear horses in the hall. The next morning I asked the front desk and found out those rooms used to be stables. The long hall went to the street, which is how the carriages entered and exited.

The next night I PURPOSELY tried to contact Jane. I went to her floor & talked to her for 90 minutes. I told her that she didn't need to stay & could move on & be with her loved ones. At first I felt a child walk around me. I heard hear a faint giggle as the little ghost hugged my legs. Then I felt a breeze & smelled a strong scent of lavender (her perfume). I asked Jane to follow me. I went downstairs & felt her behind me. I could hear her softly humming.

When we got to the 1st floor balcony. I told her to let go & move on. I could see the glow of her spirit. I told her to go up and embrace her loved ones who've been waiting so long for her. I said that this world has moved on and there's no more place for you here. Let go and rest.

I felt a SQUEEZING around my throat & knew she was VERY ANGRY. She surrounded me with a loud NO! I apologized & broke the tie. I was coughing and spitting from being choked. She rushed back upstairs. I realized at that moment the reason why she hadn't moved on. She was deadly afraid of what lies beyond. She's afraid of going to Hell. 

I wondered who the child was and hoped she'd be ok. I went back upstairs to see, but Jane was too angry to let me. I felt pressure & darkness pushing on me. It was a warning to stay away.

Unfortunately, my sleep was disturbed with nightmares all night long. Jane scalded me in the shower the next morning (I know it was her). I won't be going back there."
"My Husband's Doppelganger?","Florida","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I often feel like someone is standing over me as I sleep, my legs get shaky and light. If that makes sense. I always have. Sometimes I can almost feel who it is (my gramma, uncle, mom, etc.), other times I have this fear.

 One night I rolled over towards my husband as his back was towards me. My hair covered my left eye but I opened my right eye. When I did I saw my husband sitting there on the edge of the bed. I opened both eyes as I was going to ask him if he was OK. When I did he was also laying on the bed. I was freaked out and immediately closed my eyes. I even, for a second, had the thought he had passed away and that was his spirit sitting there until I heard him let out a sigh in his sleep. He often has nightmares that makes him cry out. It felt as though my heart fell to my stomach and my stomach to my feet.

I am not really sure what I seen but without a doubt, both entities were him. 

Just about a week later from the event, last night, I woke up to the shaky light legs feeling... My heart fell to my stomach and my stomach to my feet. Then everything went silent... But a deafening silence... Like I have never ""heard"" before. Like I almost was all alone... In a nothingness. 

Has anyone ever experienced any of this? Any thoughts? The whole thing with my husband has me freaked out.

I have used sage in our home to cleanse it. He was recently diagnosed with diverticulosis where he passed out waiting to be seen as he was losing blood, has heart stints since 2016 and takes BP meds as well as a blood thinner. We're young in our mid 40s."
"Almost Missed Them","Washington","Haunted Places","1st story; It's about 11. 00 AM, I am rinsing breakfast dishes and loading dishwasher. Dishwasher is left of the sink and next to Island that separates kitchen and living room. Both rooms are vaulted with good lighting. I started to put something in dishwasher and looked up into living room to see a short skinny stick figure almost in the middle of the living room. I feel it came up the stairs (that are in the corner of the room) from the daylight basement, and he is heading to the opposite corner to the hallway back to the master bedroom mirrors. From kitchen, hallway view is blocked by small stand-alone pantry.

 This see through stick figure is walking like it has not a care in the world, arms are swaying, legs are moving. Its head is a see through black skull, very pronounced eye sockets and eye holes, even though it's walking crossways to me its head is looking right at me. Its arms and legs are the size of the old broom handles with hay looking bristles - they still sell them today. It's walking away from me and about to go past the pantry, still looking at me and I point at it and yell I CAN SEE YOU and just laughed out loud, kind of thanking it for the show. Never saw this one again. How many times was this one strolling through my home?

2nd story We moved to the Big Island of Hawaii. I found a manufacturing job at health food company. I ended up as a press operator and enjoyed the job. I worked Noon to 10. 30 pm. Every shift I had to go into packaging area. I write down batch number and go find it. Packaging is right next to press area with plastic strip door bug curtain at entrance.

 This particular night, I was walking through plastic door I get about 3 steps in while reading the batch number to go find when I see something off to my right at the long work table there for production and sealing. I thought I was throwing a shadow from hallway light behind me. There was only 1 light in this room, but I kept going, focused on my job at hand. I look up again to see I am about to walk into someone and I immediately stop. It's still moving and stops in front of me and I am now looking down on top of its head, a very black solid form and then it's gone. I find my batch number, get it to my area, and go find the night lead to ask about this spirit.

 I found the female night lead and her 2nd in command sitting together in the lunch room. I asked them about this spirit. Their faces lit up and big smiles and said, he used to work there, and he is still working, just on the other side.

 The next day, word got around about the my crossing paths with the visitor, and many workers then shared with me some of their own sightings of spirits at this property. If I had not looked up, I would have missed this crossing."
"First Story","Utah","Haunted Places","---Note--- these are taken from my social media account and I'll be posting a few of them.

 I've lived in my house for 3 or 4 years now (time flies) and I know that there are 2 spirits in my house that are not harmful. For a while I thought it was just spirits that are more memories, if that makes sense, but the other day my wife was breastfeeding our kid and I was in the front room. I sensed something and turned facing the hallway going to the baby's room. Out of the corner of my eye when I was turning I saw a figure move from kitchen to the hallway, down to the baby's room where my wife was. So I put down my stuff and my wife was sitting in the nursing chair (it swivels and stuff). She said right before I looked in the room the chair swiveled her just a little bit (she was nursing with her knees up on the chair). I now know that the spirits in my house are interactive.

 The interesting thing is I'm 80% sure who the spirits are. The owner back in the 90s passed away in the house and I'm pretty sure his wife is here also. The house was built in the 50s. Anyways... There's my intro... I have been sensitive to spirits my whole life and I find it fun.

----story 2 since I have to do a minimum of 1500 words---

 The story I told last night happened a few months ago. This just barely happened a hour or 2 ago.

 I went out fishing with my brothers tonight so the wife was hanging out at home with our son. She was microwaving some dinner and she went out of the room to check on our kid. Then when the food was finished she went and opened the microwave and when she did the fuse for the kitchen blew. We normally have the oven going and the microwave at the same time and never have that issue.

That was the first weird thing... Next she called her mom to chit chat. They were talking and she thought she heard her dad pop in and say something but couldn't understand it so she said ""oh hey dad!"" At that moment her mom paused and said ""uhhh, who are you talking to dad isn't even home"".

A little while later she is in my son's room nursing him and everything is dark and calm. She heard what sounded like a rock hit the window then roughly a minute later she saw a dark wisp (no formed shape) of air go from the edge of the crib to the external wall where the window is. Out of caution she armed the alarm system (its Ogden you gotta be cautious! Haha) 

I then finished fishing and called her to tell her I was 20 minutes out. When I was outside the house pulling the trash to the curb, she saw the same wisp of air pass in front of her but in our family room. 

I'm actually really kind of jealous because the most I've seen is shapes move in the hallway going towards my kids room. She was kind of freaked out but she didn't sense any danger the whole time.

Anyways that's our adventure for the night.

---story 3---

So... Crazy stuff has started to happen at our house... We recently moved our renter out of the basement. We have been deep cleaning and getting it ready for the next renter. We haven't been tearing out anything yet but we have been talking about it.

So that's the background...

Since our renter moved out our activity level on the house has dramatically increased but mostly in the basement. My wife has been seeing a shadowy figure in the basement and she would catch the motion out of the corner of her eye or sensing that there was something behind her. I have started hearing voices when I'm in the basement, they sound like male voices but I cannot make out what they are saying... Normally with me it's when there is background noise going on and it will sounds like it's coming through the vents but upstairs.

Last night was the craziest experience we have had yet. I set the house alarm last night before going to bed. 249am I woke up with a start to the alarm system going off, alerting us that someone was opening doors. While exiting my room with a weapon in hand, I took a look at the alarm panel and it said garage door. The garage door is not the actual garage door, it's the separation between the main level where we live and the basement then there is the garage door in the same section. So I go and check the door and its closed and the actual garage door was locked.

We have never had any problems with our alarm system ever and since the activity in our house has picked up, we suspect that a spirit has been getting angry and messing with things.

Anyways sorry about the long story hope yall enjoyed.

---Story 4---

Update since cleansing:

We haven't seen anything in a little bit. The house has been calm, peaceful and almost lighter its seems like. 

2 days ago I was getting ready for work. I went in my son's room (we have to turn off and on a water valve to use the shower because I hate leaks) and leaning over the side of my son's crib was the lady whose husband died in the house. Her name is Rula, her husband is Ron. Then she did her normal thing and disappear but we are glad that she's at least here because we feel she is watching over our son. Ron hasn't shown up yet since the cleansing but I'll give it time. He showed up more than Rula in the past.

---Story 5--- (today's story) 

Ok, so now that I have updated everyone on how my whole house interactions have gone. If your still reading, awesome! Today is January 28,2021.

So, the other day my wife put our son in our bed and she went down to our basement to do some cleaning or whatever it was. During that time frame it was just her in the house and my son, the house was locked up and we weren't expecting anyone.

She's cleaning, then she heard footsteps in the room above her (our room where our son is asleep), since he had only been asleep for 10 minutes she went to go check and possibly put him to bed (2 year olds, they can be frustrating haha). She gets upstairs and he is dead asleep. So, she goes back downstairs and continues cleaning. She then hears the footsteps again and it sounds like its walking around our bed in a pacing fashion. So my wife checks again and my son is still asleep. At this point, she figured it was a spirit. She continues cleaning the basement and didn't get any negative feelings from it. She eventually checked again but it was the same result. 

My son sleeps for almost exactly 1 hour and that entire time he was asleep the pacing was happening. My wife is unable to see spirits but she can hear them and get a general sense if they are good or bad."
"Romantic And Sexual Relationship With A Spirit","Texas","Succubus / Incubus / Sexual Ghosts","This is a subject I have had a very hard time communicating to others and I have yet to find an outlet where it would be met with positive attention. I am somewhat embarrassed but I need to get some of it off my chest and just talk, and I need guidance from anyone whose had or heard of similar experiences.

About 5 years ago in about 2015, I had relatively limited interactions with spirits. I was deeply spiritual, not religious and I have times where I believed I had seen ghosts, felt chills, seen figures or shadows, etc. I had been living in my own home with 1 sibling, a roommate, and another family member. Sadly, there were a lot of things that started happening in the home that were not very positive, and many of them I considered paranormal. We were having conflict with my other family member and once she had left us to move somewhere else, the atmosphere lifted for a couple of days so my sibling and I had begun talking about how it seemed there was a bad spirit attached to her. We decided it was best not to let her move back in. 

After that a lot of positive things started happening in the home, we were using sage and rituals to clean out the bad stuff, things were fine. Later at night on one of these days, it was very quiet in my bedroom, and I was in total darkness.

I remember researching how to unlock my third eye for a while, and I had noticed there were some good spirits that had come out to play. But everything was deafeningly quite and still, I stared up at the ceiling, and noticed something swirling. Then it took on a human shape, a feminine figure, I must say a very nice female figure, alight with a gold flame looking aura and gold threads or something, and I felt kind of warm like we were being pulled together. What followed was something I never expected. I felt like something was trying to push my clothes off.

Tingling sensations ensued, followed by a burning sensation, that was very hot but did not hurt. I don't want to describe this too much because I don't want to get banned but... Since I had no sex life for a while up to that point I kind of let it unfold. I would probably be wrong if I said what I felt was exactly like having sex. It felt ethereal yet physical at the same time, and I was scared at first but I kept hearing in the gentlest voice, ""relax I won't hurt you"". It was crazy intense and long, I don't remember how long it lasted but my fear kind of evaporated because it was went from intense but then gentle.

Sometime afterword I asked her name and she told me it was Olivia. I kind of just internalized it the next day and at work I found myself smiling and happy, and a lot of my normal day stress was minimal because I just felt so good. I was just trying to understand what was happening, and a few days later, she showed up laying on my bed. We had a conversation I don't remember all the details of, and this time it was daytime. I remember it happening again fairly quickly. Pretty soon it became a regular occurrence, and I kept it a guarded secret from everyone.

I remember every time I spoke to her it was very sweet and she was never cruel. I have had experiences with Olivia for many years now and there have been times where she was absent because of difficulties I've had or living situations that did not work out. But recently, the same type of amazing experience that happened all those years ago happened again, and I've found myself kind of much more enamored with her than before. I don't expect everyone to have experience with these kind of things, but I have come to be very familiar with it even though I've had to take a hiatus due to mental and sexual health problems. She even told me to take some time to take care of myself instead of trying to prioritize spending time with her. I am now 27 years old and I still don't have a real, flesh-and-blood girlfriend. I had a pretty horrible experience with a sociopath girl in high school that hurt me deeply that damaged my ability to have trust with others, but I have formed a great deal of trust when I find the time to communicate with her, and she is a very good listener. There was way more to my relationship than just the sexual elements.

She's taken walks with me, watched me do things like read a book or watch tv and made comments on stuff she noticed before me, had really long and detailed conversations on all sorts of topics (and wow, talk about a smart girl and open minded too). And she's even been like and actual girlfriend or wife, telling me when something I'm doing is not good for me, asked me to brush my teeth or if I've eaten breakfast that morning, the list goes on. I'm not here on this site to grab attention or waste anyone's time with fiction. 

There have been times where I denied it myself and tried to shut it all away. But really, it's nice having a companion or guide of some sort in the absence of people, because I had been a shut in for so long until recently when I started going to social events. I figure there is a reason this is happening in the first place, and I'm hoping I can learn something valuable from all this in spite of the occasional downturns.

I guess, what I'm trying to say is, even though we've had our share of issues, I just can't see her as evil. But I am far from an expert. I'd like to hear some feedback if that's ok."
"Shadow Figure In My Grandmother's Old Home","Alabama","Haunted Places","I was recently reminded of this story while reading other posts about similar happenings.

My grandmother moved into her parents' home when my grandfather passed away and after my mother's previous home burned. My mother then moved into my grandmother's home right next door.

My grandparents had this home built when they first got married but the house went from them to my great grandparents and stayed with them until my grandmother moved back in.

The way the house was setup:

You walked into the front door into the living room and off to the left was the hallway to the bedrooms. On the left was a bedroom, a long stretch and then another bedroom. On the right side was a bathroom and a long stretch to the final bedroom with an En suite. The two bedrooms at the end of the hall were right across from each other so you could see someone walk to the bathroom. The kitchen was straight from the living room and a den was at the far right side of the house. With a patio off the kitchen. 

One night my boyfriend and I were staying with my grandmother and since I have insomnia I couldn't sleep. I see a figure walk to the bathroom and just assumed it was my grandmother. After sitting there a few minutes I realize I haven't seen her come out. I didn't hear a fall so I was perplexed and concerned so I get up to see if she's OK as she does have a history of falling and that bathroom was floor to ceiling tile. When I walk in I see she's still fast asleep and shows no signs of having gotten up. So I gently wake her and ask how long she was in the restroom. She tells me she hasn't been up at all and to not wake her again. Now I'm confused even more because I know I saw this figure walk into that bathroom. I didn't share this with my boyfriend because he doesn't believe and thinks it's myth I guess. 

My best guess is it was dark and that's why I couldn't see detail but I want to assume it was one of my great grandparents. I'd hate to know it was a true shadow figure. There's a family living there now that we know quite well and their demeaner has shifted a bit. They were super nice but now they're easily agitated and seem to want nothing to do with us. I don't want to be nosey and ask if they've experienced any activity but I am curious though."
"Kahlua's Story","Florida","Pets / Animals","On New Years Eve 2020, we had to put our little Kahlua to sleep. I lost my mind for the next three days with grief. On 1/3/2021 in the morning I heard her bark off in the distance. My husband did not hear it, I then heard her bark 2 more times. I was overcome with grief and guilt feeling that I had let her down. I decided to write her a letter. I wrote a letter in Word and poured my heart out to her. The letter was about 3/4 of a page long and I was sobbing the entire time. I'm crying now... The last sentence I typed was ""I am sending this letter to heaven"". As soon as I typed that sentence the page went blank. Word did not crash, I did not delete anything, the letter vanished. I tried to find it but the only document recovered was blank.

 Fast forward to 1/21/2021 at 7:30 PM, my husband and I were watching a movie when a small black dog came out of the wall and ran through the kitchen towards the bedrooms. Startled I jumped up in pursuit and my husband asked me loudly if I saw that too. In the bedroom our other dog who is apricot color was sound asleep. My husband and I were in shock and sat down to discuss exactly what we had seen and we both saw the exact same thing. We saw a solid small black dog from the back of the neck to the tip of the tail which was sticking almost straight out. We saw a partial back leg but no front legs or head. We saw Kahlua partially manifested running through our kitchen as solid as you and I. I started crying and so did my husband. It shocked us to our core. I am so happy that we both witnessed it so it was not wishful thinking. Kahlua was a character and the word ""No"" was never more than a suggestion to her. She was always in a hurry and would run head on all the time. Even bumping into things or falling down steps, she always ran. My love for her is still strong and my grief is too. My husband now thinks it was so cool and that Kahlua was showing up for me to see that she is ok and still running around. Don't get me wrong, my husband and I were both freaked for a while, but now understand that the universe isn't always what it seems. Thanks for reading."
"The Strange Night","Ohio","Haunted Places","Before I go into the story, hello to everyone! I haven't posted a story in a very long time, the reason behind this is things have settled down a lot in our house. But as you will figure out in this story, there's still the occasional odd experience, or more like A LOT of them. Things have decided to start acting up.

It was pretty late, I would say around 1:00 or 2:00, when me and my mom began having some strange incidents happen. My dad was asleep since he had to go to work early in the morning, so it was just me and my mom who were awake. 

My mom decided to camp out in my room and watch movies with me. We were in the middle of watching a series on my laptop, when I felt my mom jump, worried, I looked towards her. She was staring down at the bedsheets, and the first thought that came to my mind was there had to be a spider or some sort of bug in the bed, just by the scared look on her face. I began saying ''What?!'' in a worried tone. Still startled, she looked up at me and she said ''Oh my gosh, I swore I just saw blood!'' She then said ''I know that I just saw blood on your sheets!''

 I would like to add that I do have hot pink roses with green leaves on my sheets, but they look nothing at all like blood, and there was no way she could have mistaken them for blood. But in order to reassure her, as well as myself I told her ''Are you sure you actually saw blood, and not just the roses?'' I also told her that sometimes when you glance at something just briefly, you may think you saw something that wasn't actually there, considering I have done this many times myself when I only glance at something for a second. Her answer was so adamant about there being blood on the sheets, that I definitely believed her at that point. She then told me when she looked down there was blood splattered all over my sheets.

 She was so scared that she thought something may have happened to one of her family members, and she thought that was why she saw the blood. She started scrolling through her messages in her phone to see if anyone had messaged her. Seeing that she had 0 messages, she walked downstairs to make sure all of the doors were locked. 

To be completely honest, at first, I didn't fully believe my mom when she told me she saw the blood on my sheets, because it was very late, and I knew that we were both pretty tired at that point. But I didn't think that she hallucinated the whole thing, because she has been tired plenty of times and has never seen anything. When she got so worked up about the incident, and started being so adamant about the whole thing, I believed her, and she had me completely freaked out as well. 

We both got up to take our showers, since we were way overdue for them, considering it was practically morning already. We were both creeped out still, so we ended up turning on half the lights upstairs.

 Before either of us could even leave my bedroom, my mom opened the door, and there my cat was, all wide eyed, sitting in front of my door like a statue, staring right up at the top of my door. Everyone's first thought would be ''Oh, he just sees a bug, or he's just being weird.'' but I know for a fact animals can see things that we don't, and it was too big of a coincidence that he was acting like this right after my mom sees something strange.

 We both looked at the door for an insect or anything that could have caught his intention, but there was nothing. Even after my cat walked away from the door after a few minutes, he wasn't acting like himself. He acted almost as if he had been spooked by something. He was jumping at every noise we made, and walked around every room looking at every wall, ceiling and floor, as if he was looking for something. It was peculiar for him to be acting like this. 

We didn't even want to take our showers alone, so we left the bathroom door open while each of us took our shower. 

After our showers, we went back into my bedroom and laid down on the bed.

 It wasn't long before it sounded like creaking on the floor somewhere in the room. I would have liked to say it was only my imagination, but this time my mom was with me too, and she heard it as well. She had been the first one to say ''What is that?''. I just said that we were being paranoid and laid back down.

Shortly after, the creaking in the hallway started, and my mom immediately heard it. Before I continue this part of the story, I have to say this isn't the first time I heard the creaking in the hallway.

 All of the bedrooms are separated by the hallway, but I never liked looking straight out into the hallway so I have always slightly closed my door before going to sleep, so I don't have to see out into the dark hall. But every other night, I can always hear what definitely sounds like walking out in that hallway. It's very, very loud creaking on the floor and I just know someone is walking out there.

 For a month or two, my sister who is pregnant, and her boyfriend were living with us, and shared the room just across from mine, so I came to the conclusion it was one of them walking to the restroom through the night, but it continued long after they had left and moved out.

 One night, when I heard the walking in the hallway once again, I decided I would figure out what was really going on.

 I was a little fearful to open my door, so I peaked out to see if the bathroom light was on, which would tell me that my mom or dad had just been walking to the bathroom, but all the lights were out.

 The creaking started up again, and at that point I was fed up with it. I turned on my light, threw open the door, and oddly, the creaking just stopped. I saw that everyone was sound asleep, so I then knew that I was right, something strange was definitely going on.

 When my mom heard the creaking that night in my room, it had already been happening to me every other night, but I refused to tell her that. I wasn't about to freak her out more than she already was.

I have NEVER in all my years of living in our house slept without some kind of light in my room. It sounds childish, but I truly am scared of the dark, and I refuse to sleep in the dark. Therefore, I have a small, crystal sort of nightlight sitting on my dresser. After a little while, the nightlight began to flicker like it was shorting out, only when I walked on the cord. I had already walked on it a bit too much, so it completely came unplugged, leaving us in the dark. We found the light switch, and turned it on. My mom walked over, and plugged the nightlight back into the wall. My mom then went to use the restroom. 

I knew that I wasn't going to get a chance to use the restroom again, since I would be to creeped out to walk out of my room alone that night, so I decided to use the bathroom as well since my mom was already outside the room, so I didn't have to be alone. When we walked back into my room, the light switch in my room was of course still on, but the night light was AGAIN unplugged, except this time I wasn't walking on the cords at all. I found that pretty weird.

It was for sure a very strange night for both me and my mom.

I camped out with my mom in her room for 2 days after that night. I would like to make fun of myself for that, but does anyone blame me?

The night before I returned to sleeping in my room, I was watching T.V with my mom in her room.

 Out of nowhere, the Alexa device in my room began talking, which we could clearly hear from my mom's room, since the volume on my Alexa was all the way up. The Alexa said ''Hmm, I'm not sure about that.'' Something would have had to say ALEXA, and then ask her a question for her to be talking at all. I had weird things happen with the Alexa in our kitchen, which I told the story of in one of my previous stories, but this time it was the Alexa upstairs in MY room. I believe something really is trying to interact through our Alexa devices, but how can any of us know for sure? It was best to just brush the whole thing off, and hope it wouldn't happen again.

At this point in time, it's obviously pretty clear our house is haunted. By who? I'm not sure. But the little things that happen in our house creep me out of course, but other times I'm not even really that surprised about it anymore, and even become more and more fascinated with some of the things that happen.

But I definitely won't forget anything that does happen, and will be happy to share all of it.

Thank you for reading, and until next time. _Sincerely, -JB"
"Screamed Awake","Hawaii","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","2 separate occasions. 2 different States. 1st encounter

 In my Washington State home I was sleeping on my couch after getting off the night shift. It's mid morning, and I am screamed awake. Just my name. Amazingly loud. When I caught my senses I was already almost standing and moving away from the conflict. I automatically go to the back door because it's the closest entry. Our house was for sale so I thought someone yelled in but door was locked. I Looked out front and no Visitors. A very rude awakening, and a head scratcher.

2nd encounter

 We bought a fixer upper in Hawaii and moved into kind of a noisy Waterfront Condo community. We enjoyed our time remodeling and partying in the sun. We both had noticed at times the spirit of a very small dog. It barely came out of the darkness of the hall and would turn back in. There was a death in our condo told to us by the Manager, but never seen or felt him. Door opened by itself one night about 3 minutes after I climbed into bed, Yorkie seemed Anxious. I got up looked around all good. 

But one early morning was the topper. Our condos were concrete, all the windows are 3 or 4 inch glass slats floor to ceiling, not real private, you can hear the neighbors snoring 3 condos away. I slept in the corner, wife slept next to windows. Door is in front of me at my feet, we have noise machine on as we are next to main 2 way street.

"Strange Experience In The Parking Lot","California","Haunted Places","I've been thinking about posting this story for awhile now but I am worried about not being able to explain it well enough. I used to be very frightened about this but now that I am older I'm curious if anyone else has had an experience like mine. 

This took place around 16 years ago, before I moved to Norway. I lived in Southern California where I was born and raised and where the incident took place. I am not exactly sure if I was 16 or 17 years old at the time but it was somewhere around there. I am close with my mom and my grandma and we lived together at this time. In the afternoons it was common that we would run our errands together and maybe pick up dinner before going back home. One afternoon I went along with my grandma on a trip to the pharmacy. The pharmacy was in a strip mall shopping center that we visited often because our bank, grocery store and favorite Chinese food place were also located there. Anyway, this afternoon I sat in the passenger's seat of my grandma's car while she went inside the pharmacy.

It was still daylight and the parking lot had a normal amount of cars and people walking into the stores. The parking spots nearest to the side of the car I was sitting on were not taken. So there were probably 2 or 3 empty spaces next to me. While I was sitting in the car I noticed movement in the corner of my eye so I turned my head and saw something standing in an empty spot a few spots over from our car. What I saw shocked me. It was a very tall figure, maybe 8 feet tall. It resembled a human male except the face had no distinguishing features other than looking extremely melted. 

This is the part that I find difficult to explain. The face wasn't melted as in dripping-looking. It looked more like a peach color melted wax or plastic face. I don't remember seeing eyes, just places where eyes should be. It also had a very high and unnatural hair line. The hair it had resembled an extremely frizzy brillo pad wig that was melted/burned onto the head. I think the color was rust. I do not remember what it was wearing. 

It was standing there and waving excitedly at me. Its arms were just waving eagerly at me, like it was a friend who excited to see me. The moment I looked at it, I was so shocked and scared that I immediately looked away. I had a horrible feeling from seeing it but mostly I was stunned. I remember saying ""WTF, WTF, WTF"" in my head. When I turned my head away from it, it was immediately at my window. It didn't walk or run, it was just suddenly there in an instant. I was looking straight ahead while it was there at my window. It seemed to be bent over at the waist and its face was really close to the glass, it was still having its hand in an annoying and crazed greeting. I didn't know what to do, the fear felt like a punch to the gut. I was a dumb teenager so I pretended to be changing the radio channel, ignoring it. After a moment I didn't see it in the corner of my eye at the window. I turned my head to look, nothing there. I locked the car door and looked in the rearview mirror, nothing there. I looked all around the parking lot from inside the car. Nothing. If it were a person I should have been able to see it walking away from the car or walking into a store. This thing had just vanished. 

I was so freaked out that I became emotional and started crying. My grandma came back to the car from the pharmacy and I told her what happened. She could see that I was obviously upset. She listened to what happened as we drove home. When we arrived home I went straight to my mom and told her what happened too. I was still in tears and she comforted me. They both believed me but I could barely believe it myself. I've had a hard time telling this story for a long time because I would become teary trying to tell it. It was scary and it was such an uncomfortable feeing to see someone that I know could not be human. I don't know what that thing was. But I know that if I were to see something similar between then and now, I would have went to the doctor to discuss possible schizophrenia because I am sure of what I saw and it just doesn't make sense. 

We continued to run our errands at that shopping center but I never sat alone in the car again. I also remember declining to join my mom on a late night trip to the pharmacy just some years ago because it would be dark and I don't want to see anything like it again. 

A few things that I remember that I want to add. I have been around this shopping center my whole life and I have not heard of anyone having any unusual incidents there. It is not a creepy place, it's literally just a buzzing little strip mall. It was not a person in a costume. The figure was way too tall and it was way too fast when it teleported or whatever to my window. When it was at the window it seemed to be smiling; I wouldn't look directly at it when it was at the window but I saw its expression in the corner of my eye. I am not afraid of clowns but it did seem clownish in behavior (ex: the way it was waving at me furiously and smiling). I had not seen IT or heard of Slenderman or saw any movie like it around this time. I was not interested in horror films and I wasn't yet reading horror/ghost stories on the internet. The figure was not see through, misty or anything ghostly. Just extremely real and horrifying to look at, yet not of this world. I don't have any psychological conditions, I wasn't experimenting in spells or Ouija boards and I was not using drugs/alcohol, so I can rule those out. Has anyone else seen or heard of something like this or have any ideas about what happened?"
"Menacing Entity","California","A Haunted Life","My husband and I moved every 4 years with our children due to our military duties. The last 3 assignments were Los Angeles to Cape Canaveral, Florida then back to LA. We found a newly built 2-story back unit suitable for us and quickly moved in.

 About a month and a half there, at 7 months pregnant with our only girl, I took my usual trip to the bathroom at around 1am - as I returned to bed, something grabbed my foot and I fell to the ground. Luckily, I was able to lean towards the bed and bent my left knee to prevent falling flat on my belly. I was more concerned with the baby that I didn't investigate what was there. I convinced my husband not to take me to the emergency room, so I quietly cried myself to sleep while monitoring the babies movements. Apparently, I broke my back and needed surgeries to correct the injury but only after the baby's delivery.

During the span of 4 years, we had encountered a few paranormal activities at home. I heard little feet running from the hallway to my bedroom and whatever that was shook my bed as if it jumped onto the bed. I was expecting our 5-yr old son coming home from school, but it was only 9am. I was alone recuperating from surgery. It happened to my husband but we never shared our experiences, until one night...

 I came home late with my visiting mother. I entered our room but went straight to the bathroom for about 20 minutes. I heard a squealing sound coming from my room but very low. I stood near the door to hear it again. It didn't sound like my husband. As I came out, he whispered and asked to turn on the light. He was frozen in fear. He asked me to look at his chest area to see if there was anything, like an indentation. He claimed that he heard me come in the room then suddenly his body started to sink in the bed. A dark mist appeared in front of him and he couldn't scream. He tried (hence, the sound I heard). So we started talking about unusual things.

Our daughter was old enough to hold a phone and take pictures. She took 3 consecutive photos, and the one in the middle captured thick smoke over my husband's image as if there was a cigar lit next to the phone.

My sister and niece came to visit from Belgium. We set her up in one of the boys' room. Due to the time difference, she couldn't sleep. At around 3 am, she noticed a foot tall black mass came out of the closet in front of the bed and floated towards the open door. This entity passed by the night light installed in the hallway, outside the bedroom. She watched this thing moved with a purpose. She was terrified and refused to sleep there again.

We eventually moved after retiring, still in LA. My husband told me that this thing followed us."
"It's Either Me Or The Orb!","Arizona","Orbs / Lights / Mists","This story begins the week of moving into my new place in Phoenix, with odd little sounds and whatnot, finishing with my favorite experience: the tale of the orb. If you are bored with stories about little sounds and voices, I recommend jumping right to the end paragraph. 

Upon the first or second night, of moving in with my partner, I had fallen asleep on the couch in the living room while watching a movie. When I woke up in the middle of the night, it was to a flickering fan going berserk in the dining room area. ""Ticka-ticka-ticka-ticka"", it went as the blades cast light and shadow over everything in the dim light. It was scary to wake up to, but I figured the wiring of it must be screwy. So I skittered off down the dark hallway to the bedroom and went to sleep, dashing away from the willies.

 The next day I shared my story about the dining room fan going nuts to my partner, and as I said this, I looked over to the area only to realize, as he started to say, ""We don't have a dining room fan."" And it's true, in actuality, it was only the light above the table flickering at a very low setting. It continued to do this once in a while until we replaced the bulb. No ghosts here.

Other odd things that have happened through my two years here have been a general experience of sounds in the kitchen but nothing in the cabinets, like sounds of plastic being moved, but there's no plastic to be moved anywhere. I inspect cabinets for holes, there's nothing, all new cabinets. It happens a lot, and I stare at the kitchen as it happens, seeing nothing. I try to go through everything, rattling, making nose, and I don't hear anything trying to run off, which is what I expect if it's mice or rats. Still not too weird.

Another time, I was sitting in the living room and heard my partner at the end of the hallway which opens into the living room, he said in a very sleepy way, ""So tired."" which isn't an uncommon thing for either of us to say, and I was feeling very tired when it occurred (but wide awake). The thing is, I knew he was in the bedroom with the door closed and I would have heard that very creaky door open if he had come through. When I later went to the bathroom, I saw that yes, the door was closed, and I was just hearing things? But it also felt a bit like, ""Ah a ghost is trying to share my tiredness with me, or even mock me in my tiredness!"" I also know it isn't too uncommon for people to have little innocuous audible hallucinations once in a while, without it being anything pathological, but it was still sort of funny and strange in the moment. 

Other times, it sounds like someone is walking on parts of the hall's bamboo rug when nobody else is home. 

But as for the orb...

My second round of night-frights came maybe a week into having moved here. I was in bed, fast asleep, and I had a very vivid dream that I was exactly where I was, in bed, asleep and unable to move while a white glowing orb that was slightly smaller than a bowling ball was trying to enter my chest. I could feel the force of it trying to push its way through my chest, and I was resisting it, trying to prevent it from getting in. The real horror for me was that if it got inside of me, if I absorbed it, I wouldn't know anymore if I was myself or if I was the orb functioning as myself. I tried resisting it, but the orb kept knocking into my chest and finally I tired out and it won. It got in, I absorbed it. The horror quickly passed from ""What if I am the orb?"" to ""Well I don't feel any different so I guess that's okay"" which is a pleasant effect of the orb for me, the vessel, to not have to be horrified of the change. I can't say that my life has tremendously improved or worsened since the orb, and I still foolishly experience myself as my true self, in utterly oblivious bliss!

Thanks for reading, and thanks to those posting their true experiences!"
"Halloween Terror On Captain Ellis Lane","Massachusetts","Haunted Places","It was Halloween night and I was a small child of 8 years old, preparing to go trick-or-treating with a group of neighborhood children. I was going with my friend Jenny, her friends Haley and Allie, and Jenny's older brother who would be supervising us. We had just gotten our costumes finished and were grabbing our candy bags. Just as we were about to leave, Jenny's mom announced that she had a few rules for us that must be followed: we must be home by 9 PM, do not speak to strangers, and wherever we go, DO NOT go down Captain Ellis Lane.

""Why can't we go down Captain Ellis Lane?"" I asked her mother, to which the reply was, ""That's the rule. Now have fun."" No further explanation. 

I knew where that road was because I had driven past it in the car with my mother multiple times, but never gone down. It was 3 streets down from mine and through a series of side streets was connected to my street, as well as to the main road. All I knew was that it was desolate and dark, much more so than the other roads in its vicinity, and had an old abandoned farm a little ways down the road. From the main road, no houses were visible, the road looked completely empty. 

After a passing thought of ""Oh, that street is a bit dark and poorly lit, that must be it,"" I put it out of my mind and left with my friends, ready to enjoy the evening. We went down several other streets and had gathered a lot of candy. People loved my costume, I was having a great night. I was ready to head home and mentioned to my friends' brother that we should start heading back. My friends had other plans. 

On the way home, we stopped right in front of Captain Ellis Lane. I was perfectly content not going down the road but my friends all said ""What are you waiting for? Are we going or not?"" 

""NO, no, we cannot, did you not hear what Jenny's mom said? We are not supposed to go down this road!"" I exclaimed. But by that point it was too late. They had already descended into the darkness, leaving me behind, and I ran ahead to catch up.

I looked down the street and from the view of the main road it was completely unlit and looked abandoned, in complete contrast to the other streets in the area which were well-lit and densely populated. I heard the rattling of a flag against a flagpole but could not tell where the sound was coming from and the bristling of the wind through the trees. All I could see was one house immediately to my right, an old house that looked like a farm house at what appeared to be the end of the street, and a large, fenced off plot of land to the right far ahead. The left side of the street was covered with trees and brush. It felt like I was walking down a road in the middle of nowhere and something was lurking in the shadows waiting to jump out. I did not like it one bit. 

The road forked. I looked to the right and saw that the street did, in fact turn into a more ""normal"" looking, and better lit street with several houses. To the left was a gravel road encircling a large, fenced off plot of farmland. I could not see the end of the farm but I could barely make out that in the distance was a small white shed. 

All of a sudden Jenny shouted ""1, 2, 3, I'll race you to the shed! Let's go!"" and I immediately protested. I insisted that we were trespassing, that the farm likely belonged to one of the houses we had just passed. I did not want to get in trouble and I will not lie, I was scared! But I also knew I would be left behind in the dark to fend for myself if I did not take off running toward that shed.

Just as we prepared to go, with my heart racing and pounding out of my chest, I heard the creaking of a door which came to a hard THUD as it shut. We all froze and stared at one another trying to figure out where the sound was coming from. Allie said it must be from the shed. The door was probably not firmly secured and had blown shut in the wind, she said, an explanation I was prepared to accept but did not truly believe. It was so far in the distance I could barely see it, just the vague outline. I was ready to turn and run back but they began walking ahead of me on the gravel road, now slowly walking and trying to listen for sound of activity.

As we walked, I felt the distinct sensation that someone was following us. There were 5 of us, but whomever was walking furthest back said they could hear footsteps immediately behind them, but when we stopped they stopped with us, and when we turned around there was no one there. Jenny's brother called out ""Is there someone there?"" but no response.

As we approached the shed, I heard the rustling of leaves and footsteps in the woods to the right of the gravel road. These were not the sounds of an animal but they sounded like human footsteps. I was not even thinking of the paranormal right now, I feared we were being followed by a living person and I was terrified. Even with 5 of us, it would be difficult to fend off an adult attacker. Haley shouted out that she swore she saw a shadow dart in front of the shed and then disappear. I didn't see anything but I also was too nervous to think.

We climbed quietly over the fence and were now in a large plot of farmland. The shed was now only a few hundred feet in front of us. We quietly approached it. I was on high alert for any movement and I was terrified. I didn't know why I didn't just run back home by myself to Jenny's house when I was on the main road, because however dangerous it would have been I would have felt much less nervous than here. 

Haley, the bravest of us all, walked up to one of the shed windows and began to peer inside. It was too dark to see anything. She took out her flashlight and began to look inside. For a few seconds she looked around and all seemed normal. All of a sudden, she let out a LOUD, TERRIFIED SCREAM, dropped her entire bucket of candy and ran away from us through the field and back over the fence. She was stuttering as she tried to tell us what she saw. None of us understood what she was trying to say. She was shaking profusely and practically in tears and begged us to run back to her and walk back home. I could tell she was terrified and on the verge of a panic attack.

Lights began to turn on in the few nearby houses and voices could be heard. Haley's scream must have caught their attention. We quickly picked up our belongings, dashed back down the street as quietly as possible and headed back to the main road. No one saw us as we fled as fast as we could down the dark street.

When we got back to the house, Haley confessed what she saw. She said that she was looking in the shed and at first she only saw gardening tools and empty crates, but then she saw a child. Not a normal child, but a small boy with gaping bloody holes where the eyes were supposed to be, a bony skeleton-like emaciated frame, and the most disgusting rotted teeth she had ever seen, smiling in a sinister smile walking toward the window. 

We all froze, terrified by the thought. But we all promised that no matter what we did, we would keep it a secret from Jenny's mom that we disobeyed her rule. 

To this day I do not know if she really saw the image of a child in the window or if she was playing a prank on us. But recently, I drove down the road during daylight and noticed that the shed was no longer there and had been replaced. I learned that Jenny's mother had almost purchased a home on that street but had decided against it because she preferred the street they ended up living on, and she too had found the abandoned farm area to be creepy and off-putting and did not want us there because it was poorly lit. If only she knew what Haley actually saw that night."
"Astral Projection 2 Stories","Washington","Misc","Recently I've been very interested in astral projection. Taking all the precautions and extensive research etc. I have met my spirit guides, I'm very in tune with the paranormal.

 One night after work (I work swing shifts) it was about 4 or 5 am for some reason I think wow this is a great idea to try astral projection for the first time, lol. I surround myself with a ball of white light and love. I have all my crystals all around my room. I get comfortable on my bed watch a guided meditation on YouTube because I have the hardest time focusing since spirits like to pop in and out and distract me.

 I start to feel myself floating after a while when suddenly I hear a robotic like male voice. I thought okay it's probably my tv right? Nope it was on mute I had one headphone in and my other ear was on my pillow. I relax then I hear it again. I cannot make out any words but this time it startled me.

 I stopped all together that night. I have no idea if it was a spirit guide or if it was a spirit trying to make contact I wasn't scared just startled.

 Part 2- This is about a week later I decided okay, let's try it during the day (I have seen it works a lot better during the day). I lay down, get comfy, put my headphone in and listen to the guided meditation. After a while I feel myself floating again. I start seeing ripples while I'm floating up, it feels like I'm going up through a tunnel, finally I am surrounded by the stars and I see these 2 beautiful beings. I've seen them only through pictures they were light beings. They opened their arms to welcome me as I reached out. I was only there for a couple minutes then I was back into my body this experience was way better than the first time.

 I think I need more practice, but I was excited to see them I hope next time I get to spend longer with them and meet other beings."
"Confirmation And Decisions","North Carolina","Haunted Places","I haven't made a post in about 5 years due to the inability to access my account. 

My last post was about paranormal experience in my house as a 16 year old that has definitely been confirmed.

Around the age of 20, one morning I had went to visit a friend, Chris. At the time I had been on drugs heavily and was not the best person I could be. We had been having a conversation about something or another and he received a call from his mother, whom I have never met and is a preacher, she asked to speak to me directly.

I take the phone and this women proceeded to tell me that she got a message from God for me saying that He was protecting me and that what I had dealt with as a teenager had reattached itself to me, and that I needed to bless my house once more. She told me that He had felt my pain and would hear me crying myself to sleep every night; that he was always there. He said that for some reason paranormal entities where becoming attracted to me.

I was also informed that this would not be the last paranormal being I would come across and that I need to learn to protect myself against them.

Although I have been trying to ignore all the hints of something else being near me when I am alone in a room; the slight brush of a hand down my back or seeing something running back and forth out of my side view, it has slowly become more and more annoying. 

I have had quite a few experiences that have made me question if I am truly safe where I am at or if I will be followed where ever I go. I have an almost two year old and feel that she may have the same problem growing up."
"A Ghost In My Home","Indiana","Haunted Places","I have had some paranormal activity since I purchased my Home in 2015, but lately it has gotten more active but only during the night. Some nights I am awakened by a Voice saying things that I can not understand but a couple weeks ago the voice said plainly, 'I want milk', I turned the light on and answered but got no response. I went back to sleep then was awakened by the sound of feet running fast by the recliner I was sleeping in, I could even feel a cold breeze on my face from the movement.

 I recently purchased a Voice Activated Recorder but do not seem to have any activity when this is on. Last night I was in my bed reading a book, when I all at once got the feeling that something was staring at me, looked around but could see nothing, read a few more minutes put the book down on the bed, put my glasses on top of the book, turned off the light and within seconds heard and felt something punch the book. I turned the light back on and my glasses were laying on the floor.

 Over the years I have experienced a lot of cabinet and closet doors opening and closing and other noises during the night. I so far have not actually felt fear and believe that whatever it is is just being mischievous and poses no real danger, but I could be wrong. This is not my first experience with a house with paranormal activity, I sold that property and got rid of it and later the people that purchased it asked me if we had any kind of paranormal activity while we lived there and I told them that I may have but was not sure. I sure would like to know how to get rid of what I am experiencing here now though."
"The Key To A Better Day","Virginia","Haunted Places","I have had many unexplainable phenomena happen to and around me over the years. This particular extraordinary event occurred in November of 2007, Norfolk, VA, USA. My husband and I were living in a small 1950's home that we were in the process of renovating until the day we sold it and I was around 4 months pregnant with our son. 

 The back story on our house is that it was owned by the Gray's prior to my husband buying it in 1999. We do not know exact dates but we know that Mr. Gray passed first and that Mrs. Gray took her final breaths in that house in 1998. There was not much notable activity but occasionally you could feel a feminine presence. It was disapproving sometimes and would hover watching us when we got up to our early 20's antics of partying. On one occasion the dog door flap swung back and forth for a half an hour. Our dog Shadow was in the room with me and there was no wind strong enough to move a dog door flap big enough for a Rottweiler. It freaked me out but Shadow was calm and she was a coward so I told myself it was fine.

 I owned a small business at the time and we were gearing up for the holiday season. My mother in law had unexpectedly passed a month prior and my husband was still numb. I was trying to carry the bills, a child, and a grieving husband through the retail rush. He was working construction and left earlier in the morning than I did most days.

 In a hurry to get out of the house and open my store I locked my keys in the house. My husband was at work already and I needed to open my store on time or the mall would charge a fine. I was an emotional wreck with trying to work through the combination of loss and pregnancy. So, there I was standing next to my car looking up at the sky about to break down sobbing, it was all wrong. I shouldn't be shoving down my excitement about my pregnancy because my husband needed me. His mom shouldn't be dead. It shouldn't be on the brink of Black Friday. I wanted a BREAK. I just needed to get in the house and get my keys. The back door was probably unlocked but jumping a six foot fence while pregnant was a last case scenario. I started to walk back up the path to the front steps and stopped. Choking back a sob and blinking to fight my tears I looked down and there was a key at my feet. A house key. Not on a keychain. We did not have extra keys. I can't tell you if it was left there by Mrs. Gray or by Brian's mom but it was everything I needed right then. I picked it up and it was the key to my front door. The key felt like a literal symbol that there was hope and that I was not doing this alone."
"There's Something In Your Room","New Jersey","Haunted Places","This happened to me and a friend in November of 2017. My friend lives up the block from me, our school is up the block from her. Normally, I would wait for her outside house, but that morning I really had to use the bathroom. She let me into her house and told me that there is something weird going on in her house. I used the bathroom, and as was leaving the bathroom, the door suddenly slammed shut by itself. Take notice, the bathroom window wasn't open, and there was no draft, and none of the windows in the house was open, not to mention, it was only me and her in the house, her mom had already left for work, and her sister had left for school.

My friend, I will call her Mel in this case, came out of her room and asked if everything was ok. I told her that the bathroom door slammed out of nowhere. ""A lot of things happen around here, but the bathroom door never slams shut,"" she said looking at me worried.

 We dismissed the situation and went to her room (she was still doing her hair). I walked into her room, and sat down on her bed, while she finished doing her hair. Her closet door was open and I saw all the hangers started moving rapidly, and some even fell to the floor. I jumped up nervous, and we both kind of ran out of the room.

I was shaking all over, and told her to hurry up, because I didn't want to be in the house for too long. She sat down to put her sneakers on, when a sudden movement in her room caught my eye. A dark mass, with the outline of a person, was walking around in her room. I have always been able to see ghosts, and my 8th grade year (this is in 2017), I seem to be able feel them around me, and connect to their energy. The energy in the house got dark, and heavy. I screamed and started pulling on her to get of the door. I was hysterical as she told me later, and I was screaming ""We need to leave now, we aren't safe"". 

I swear I have never felt more afraid in my life after that experience. She told me later that year, that something had followed her sister home, one day, that it seemed to be a friend or family member, but I don't really think they liked me much, because Mel told me the day I was in the house, was the only time that the ghost had caused so much chaos."
"Haunted Ring","North Carolina","Haunted Items","This event took place about 3 years ago, my mother had just purchased a ring from a new age store called Earth Bound, and shortly after she experienced very weird things.

 One night my mother was sleeping in her bed when she woke up and noticed a girl standing at the end of the room next to her closet. The girl was wearing a long white dress that went down to her ankles and she had long black hair that covered her drooping head, yes, very stereotypical I know.

 When the girl noticed her she floated towards my mom moving very fast. When my mom looked at her face, her eyes were like black holes, her mouth was the same. Suddenly the hole for her mouth opened wide as if she was screaming at my mother, my mom jumped back and turned the light on and she disappeared, this went on for about a month she said.

 I for some reason paid this no mind despite the fact I am very fascinated by the unseen world, I personally wish I would have took interest in it when it happened. Lots of strange events happened because of that ring; for example when my mom would be in her car she would realize the mirror would be directly pointing at her face, the car mirror is very sturdy and does not move mind you so this was very weird indeed. She was almost hit by cars multiple times also.

 After a while my mom decided to try throwing it away, this worked for about a week, there were no encounters at all during this period of time, however after that week had ended the girl came back. My mother was searching through her jewelry box one day and saw something, the ring she had thrown away was sitting there on top of all her other rings.

 After that my mother and sister decided that they would put the ring in a bag of salt and throw it away, hoping that would rid the spirit for good. The spirit never has returned to this day, however I cannot help but wonder what will happen if the ring is freed from that bag, will the girl return, or will it find a new person to haunt?."
"When Evil Is Your Salvation","Illinois","Haunted Places","I'm going to start this back in January 2019. That isn't the true beginning of it, but when it became very apparent that something was not right with me, and I was becoming more depressed. Normally, I can pinpoint a reason for any down mood and work my way back from it, but this time was different. I'm not sure I can aptly explain it, but the cause wasn't coming to me from the physical or spiritual planes, in other words not something I was picking up from a past event or someone close to me (empathy) or from an event in my life (like someone dying, or loosing a job) but there I was tottering on the brink of that infamous rabbit hole, without rhyme or reason, and no amount of shielding was helping. In March I visited my doctor, who did a full blood panel. Result: I was 'dangerously low' on vitamin D. 

 I know, right? Sounds silly that a basic vitamin could be playing havoc with my mood. However, it is one that reacts like a hormone and affects everything from your immune system, to emotions. One of the symptoms is depression. Couple that with negativity at work, and at home emanating from the roommate -recipe for disaster. I didn't expect miraculous results - as in over night, but thought 'AHA! There's the reason!' I was wrong. Over the following months it became worse.

 I've spoken of my roommate before, and there was an almost tangible shift in him. He became increasingly secretive, and more prone to tantrums, which often turned violent. His 'disabilities' were rapidly becoming excuses for not doing anything he didn't want to do, including basic hygiene (which he blamed on his weight, claiming he had great difficulty and couldn't climb into the shower/tub, however he had no problems if he was going out...) He became quite slovenly, to the point I stopped having even the occasional friend in for coffee after work, as I didn't know what we'd be walking in on. Somedays, it was literally trash everywhere, even on the furniture, which he had basically broken by plopping down on it instead of sitting, or with an explosive act of rage - that even the most innocent comment might trigger. I won't delve into the details, but things were definitely not good. It was as if the last 10 years of growth he had gone through never happened, even the social graces I had taught him went out the window.

I tried to 'read' him and saw blackness and felt almost ill. Whatever he was up to was bad, real bad. It saddened me that I was probably going to have to throw in the towel and advise his State Guardian, that he might need institutionalized, given that he was failing to care for himself, and the out bursts becoming a bit of a threat to my safety. 

Both his Guardian and I searched for doctors that would take his state insurance, and then came the battle to make him continue seeing them. 

I know what you're thinking - none of this is paranormal, it is however the ground work for what happened to make sense. 

It was November of that year, and that old rabbit hole had become even deeper. I took no joy in anything any more. My world had become a dark abyss, age old personal demons raising their heads and stirring.

 This particular afternoon wasn't even as bad as most of them had gotten to be. I was off work, in my jammies, sipping a soda pop in front of my computer, trying to talk myself up (sometimes in life you just have to be your own cheerleader) when from the direction of my closet a voice spoke. A voice I knew all too well. It was my father's voice intoning that horrid laundry list of my faults and failures, just as he did when alive. I sat there and took it. Just as I did all those years of growing up. I was devil spawn and worthless. No one could love me, not even God. I should do the world a favor and kill myself. I was just wasting space and no one would miss me... I felt myself nodding agreement as I began to think that maybe he was right. I want to be clear, I was hearing him with my ears and not inside my head. 

 I don't really understand what happened next, only that quite suddenly I felt as if I had been struck in my chest by a charge. My hands flew up to cover my ears, even as my head raised and I stared at the closet space. I heard myself speaking, ""Shut up! Shut up! You're dead and gone and can't hurt any one any more. You couldn't break me then and you won't now!"" I was shaking, and that charge in my chest area seemed to be pulsating strength into me. Silence. Blissful silence.

Now, I don't claim to know a heck of a lot of things, but I do know that when you start hearing voices telling you to hurt yourself or others and you come even remotely close to listening to them, it's time to call in the cavalry. Doesn't matter where you think the voice came from.

I went for an evaluation. Being truthful about the whole thing was really hard, but you can't expect solid help with half truths. I knew/feared it could mean being admitted for a bit (I wasn't), but better that then dead. I just didn't want to be on a bunch of drugs. I wanted my joy back. I was diagnosed with PTSD and depression, and see Dr. G weekly. I'm getting stronger, and the rabbit hole is getting shallower. 

January 2020: I'm not at liberty to give many details on this, but it is pivotal to my account. The darkness from the roommate was enough that I often felt ill just being in the same room as him, and avoided touching anything even around him as much as possible. The images that I'd get were too disturbing. I had warning visions and dreams concerning him. I strengthened my shields as much as possible; I didn't want to believe what I 'seeing', and blamed my depression for a large part of it. I wasn't 'well' yet, and my psyche was coloring it darker than it was. Oh, I so wanted to be wrong - but I wasn't. Second week in January the cops showed up with a search warrant, and that was the end of my roommate. 

 My landlord worried about what it would do to my financial dynamics. I told him I would probably get another roommate, but first I wanted to take advantage and overhaul the apartment (paint it, replace the busted furniture, etc.) He was quite amiable on it and asked how long I thought it might take. Dr. G placed me with a case worker that specializes in such cases; helping others get the help they need. The roommate's room is just down right nasty. I curse myself for respecting privacy so dang much. It's so bad, I even turn down the caseworker's offer of help to clean it. 

 During this time the ghosties started waking up. Small happenings, but helpful. I have to admit, I kind of missed them. 

March: Covid strikes and I get laid off. I also figure a new roomie at this time was not the wisest move, besides I'm still trying to get the apartment back in order, and with finances being tight, it's quite the challenge. 

April-October: This is a compilation of activity in those months. My landlord decided to renovate my kitchen. Cabinets, counters, sink, floor - even a new LED light fixture! Now, I had planned to paint the kitchen, and I knew the ghosties agreed because items were getting removed from the walls without my touching them. Example: I had one of those expandable racks with pegs (looks like a bunch of exes) on the wall holding coffee mugs. It's hung there close to 18 years with no problems. I came out one day to find it and the mugs carefully laid on the counter. 

Bathroom: there's this UGLY long towel rack spanning the far wall - I've always disliked it, as it's in the most illogical place - clear across from the facilities. I decided it had to come down. It was there prior to my moving in, and I think it dates back to the 70s, since no one ever removed it, but painted around it, it was now part of the wall. A real bugger to get off - actually took part of the wall. I'm staring at it and hear a male voice say ""Got (word I didn't catch) putty?""

A bit later I'm wondering out loud if I should paint the cabinet as well, and hear the same male say, ""I would."" 

Living Room: I'm up on the small ladder when it wobbles, and suddenly stops as if steadied. Male voice ""Careful - I got you.""

Now I'm working on my bedroom. Some day I'll tell you all how much I HATE painting ceilings! Especially here, where they are geometrical nightmares. Lol

I won't lie, there are times this all seems a bit over-whelming, especially since work seems postponed indefinitely. Now and then, I'll feel a pat on my shoulder or an one armed hug. I'll hear someone walking around. I've furniture I've been waiting on since August, very frustrating. One day I was bemoaning the fact, semi-out loud, when I heard a voice say, ""How many chairs can you sit on at once?"" It made me smile a bit. ""Smarty,' I murmured to the air. Right though, I can only sit one place at a time. 

November, a year since I had scraped bottom, and I've been wondering. If my father had not spoken to me so, given the downward spiral I had taken, and the events that followed, would I have had the safety net of support that I've so desperately needed? Would I have kept my own council and simply bulldogged my way through, and remained miserable? My dad always knew that gotten mad enough I'd fight back, and if scared enough I'd ask for help. Maybe, just maybe what I saw as evil, was intended as my salvation from myself."
"The Ghosts Of Gettysburg","Pennsylvania","Haunted Places","I've always thought that my experiences in Doha, Qatar, were long dead and buried. I thought that after moving to the United States I'd be rid of all the paranormal phenomenon that haunted the lives of my children and myself. But recently something strange happened.

 We are in the process of looking for colleges for my eldest who is a senior. Recently we took a trip to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania for this purpose. We reached late and checked into a hotel. Not the wisest idea in times of covid, but nonetheless, the next morning we explored the place and the grounds of the school. Our exploration led us to the site of the Gettysburg battlefield.

 It was a cold day so we mostly drove through the place. It's beautiful and so full of history. We are big history fans here and anything as poignant as the bloodiest battle of the Civil war left us entranced. We got down to explore some of the war time monuments. 

We didn't stay long as it was a bright clear crisp but cold morning. I noticed as I was walking back to the car, I felt my body grow heavy as if someone had placed a weight above my shoulders. I felt nauseated and drained of energy and got such a bad headache. I literally ran back and shut the door of the car. We literally did not stop after that, and quickly left the battleground. The feeling immediately evaporated as soon as we drove away and things went back to normal. 

I've never been the one to believe in energy. I've always frowned of a place having residual energy as such, but this trivial incident has left me feeling unsettled and with questions. Why did I feel like that? Was is my imagination or something more?

 After coming back home, I researched the history of the place. Well it was gruesome, it says that countless lives were lost and people have seen civil war soldiers and once or twice two college professors while they were stepping out of the elevator came upon a complete scene where they saw a civil war hospital with doctors and nurses and even wounded soldiers. The article says that all the spirits stopped and turned toward the elevators to look at the two professors who had quite accidentally stepped into 1863. So I'd really appreciate if someone could shed some light into what I experienced that day, please. Was it a figment of my imagination or people do feel like this in places with such sad energy? I look forward to hearing your take on this. Thanks for reading about my experience."
"Her Squeak Toy","Washington","Pets / Animals","My mother had passed away in 1999. I Inherited her beautiful dog (we will call her GEM for this story.) She was black with curly long hair, possibly golden retriever mix. She was friendly and was a kind spirit, and I let her wander the neighborhood. Gem loved chewy squeak toys and we laughed seeing her so happy, chewing away on them. We bought her an Orca Whale squeak toy about 8""long and she looked really funny outside walking around with that Whale sticking out of her mouth. She loved going fishing and exploring the shoreline with me. We took Gem down to the river one beautiful sunny day, she was older now, her sight was going. She is running in the woods as we are walking down this dirt road, we hear her whimper, and find she had fell into a large hole. I lift her out, she is hurt but quiet. We drive to the vet's clinic and were told it's her time to go. We were present and sent her to dog heaven.



 Some time later we get a free Yorkie. He is 2 years old. Yorkie is a cute and loving MALE that loves his new mom. Yorkie also loves squeak toys and some have to be hidden for a while as he acts almost crazy, time will pass and we will give it to him again. Fast forward a couple years.

 I was cleaning off mantel one day and GEM'S old Orca has been sitting up here for many years. I grab it and I am going to take it to a bookcase in smaller room but Yorkie sees it and now following me all excited. I place orca up on a shelf. Many of his toy's are hiding up here. I leave the room go about my business. After a while I hear him whimpering and finally get up and go look. Yorkie is spinning circles in front of book case all excited. I pick him up and we scan the shelves, there's at least 6 of his toys up here but he see's ORCA and has to have it. Not thinking I grab the Orca and put both on the floor, and head back to living room. I'm watching TV now and suddenly there is banging above my head in the wall in vaulted ceiling attic area, very odd. Now I also hear Yorkie in other room having a fit. 

 I am irritated now and walk in to room to see Yorkie has broken the now brittle soft plastic tail on the ORCA and now has a big gash in tail area. I pick ORCA toy up, Yorkie is in hot pursuit, I walk to kitchen and throw ORCA in the garbage can. There is still banging in attic wall area. I think maybe a bird got in the attic. I look out back door and remembered I installed metal screens on all vent blocks. I go out front door, no wind it's a calm day, banging constant now. Yorkie is at garbage can, still whimpering. I stop and gather my thoughts, I can literally see the spot in the wall, attic area where banging is coming from. I see Yorkie at garbage can and I went and gently pulled ORCA out of the garbage can and put it back on the mantel. Banging in attic area stopped. We never heard banging in attic before or after this day. We still have HER SQUEAK TOY."
"I Caught More Spirits On Video!","New York","Photographs / Videos / EVP","It's been a while since I posted to this site. So, I thought I'd post an update. Things died down a few weeks after our renovations ended. I managed to settle into my new room, and I've been working towards my goal of becoming a cartoonist/animator. 

Everything was perfectly fine until about two weeks ago. I was downstairs getting my lunch ready for the next day, when I felt like I was being watched. Instead of ignoring the feeling like I usually do, I looked up. In the reflection of the kitchen window (I was using the reflection to check the nearby hallway, so that I could keep working on my lunch and be in bed a few minutes earlier then normal), was what looked like a white dress from the late 1800s to the early 1900s. There was no body attached. It was just the dress. Posed in such a way that if it had hands, they would have been clasped gently in front.

Some how I knew that this was a neutral ghost. Not bad but not good either. Yet, because of the fact that almost all of my previous experiences have been extremely negative, immediately I started to panic. The apparition was standing in the middle of the only part of the kitchen that didn't lead into a pantry, bathroom, or outside. I was trapped. I put my head down, and started making my food as quickly as possible. By the time I was done, the apparition had vanished. I bolted for the stairs too terrified to look over my shoulder.

 I've seen videos of people using a tiktok filter to ""see"" apparitions. So, for whatever reason I decided to try it (even though I'm prone to anxiety and panic attacks and just thinking of what I've seen scares the crap out of me.) I downloaded the app while I was sitting in my living room watching Youtube on my tv. Out of curiosity I put the filter on, and panned around the living room, and some of the adjoining rooms... Wouldn't you know, I found something... And immediately regretted even thinking about downloading the app in the first place.

 Within a matter of minutes, I managed to gather three separate videos of what ever calls my house home, and I think I've found part of the cause of all the ghostly happenings around here. I'll be posting them to Youtube in the next few days."
"Van Horn, Texas: Disembodied Voices & Sounds","Texas","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","*My following account was brought to life in Episode 3 of Blood Moon Podcast.

The day after Christmas in 2009, my wife and I took a road trip from California to Texas. After a full day of driving, we stayed over night at a hotel where my wife made reservations. The hotel was located in a small town called Van Horn. At the time, the town was deserted and the hotel was the only business in operation. In passing, my wife mentioned to me that the person she spoke to on the phone claimed to have had unexplained events at the hotel.

We arrived at the hotel after midnight. After checking in went to our room. The room had one bed and one closet. The bathroom was to the right of the closet not far from the room's entrance. The bathroom's toilet was to the left, the sink to the right and the shower was along the back wall. I decided to unwind and read the Hockey News Magazine while my wife slept. After twenty minutes or so I turned out the lights and fell asleep. 

Suddenly, I woke up to the sound of water splashing and swirling. It sounded like it was coming from the tub in our bathroom. It was very loud as if someone was bathing or perhaps, struggling. It didn't sound as if it was coming through the walls or from outside. I rolled over to see that my wife was sound asleep. A sense of urgency prompted me to grab my flashlight. By the time I got to the bathroom the splashing had stopped.

I walked into the bathroom and it was empty. No signs of life or activity. I checked all around the bathroom for water or wetness. The water was not running in the sink or in the tub. The tub itself was dry to the touch. The toilet wasn't running and the sink was dry as a bone. Then, I looked out the room's window to see if there was a swimming pool. There wasn't a pool, just the hotel's parking lot. Later, I found out that the hotel does not even have a pool. 

My wife woke up from my rummaging and I explained to hear what happened. She said didn't hear the splashing and promptly rolled over and fell asleep. Checking the clock, I saw that it was after 5 o'clock in the morning but it was still pitch black outside. Exhausted, I gave up my search and went back to bed.

While sleeping, I heard whispering in my ear. I woke up but I kept my eyes closed. I heard a female voice ask, ""Who did this to us?"" I opened my eyes and responded, ""Who did what to you?"" The cascade of whispers moved over to my wife's side of the bed. Again, the voice asked, ""Who did this to us?"" Expecting to see someone, I looked over to my wife's side of the bed but no one was present.

I grabbed my flashlight to look for vents to see if the voice could have traveled from another room. Nothing. I couldn't hear voices coming through the walls either. The door was locked therefor no one could enter. Finally, I realized that something invisible was in the room. 

I made an effort to communicate with whomever or whatever spoke to me. Once again, I ended up waking my wife. I told her what I experienced. Yet again, she said she did not hear the whispering. At that point, I checked the time and it was 7:00am.

When we were checking out, we asked the owner if anyone was staying in the rooms either side of our room. She told us that both rooms were vacant and strangely enough, we were the only people to occupy that floor. I shared with her my experiences. According to the owner, I was the first to specifically report disembodied voices. She then shared stories of unexplained events witnessed by others. On one interesting note, we did learn of a rumor that long ago a female was murdered at the hotel."
"Good Ghost","North Carolina","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","During my early years of growing up, ages 6 to 12, my family lived on the campus of a boys reformatory school on the outskirts of Rocky Mount, NC. My dad was a councilor there.

 We live in a small 2 bedroom house. My mom and dad in one room. I and my 2 sisters in the other. On many nights I had witnessed a figure with a long robe or gown come into our room and seem to stand or kneel at the foot of my sisters' bed. All that I can remember now is being afraid and turning toward the wall. I don't remember if I ever mentioned it to my parents of even my sisters back then. 

Years later, after we are grown, in jest, I mentioned it to them one day as we sat around talking about the old days. Much to my surprise they both had seen the same thing I had. Don't know if there is anything to it, but I have always wondered did whoever lived there before or after us see the same image.

 The house is still there as far as I know. It is actually a minimum security prison for women now. The house was old when we lived there back in the 1960's and early 1970's. I don't know how all this works. Could someone have died in this house before we lived there? Was this a guardian angel? Lots of questions run through your mind as you get older and reflect back on things from the past. It is really weird when years and years later you talk to someone who saw or experienced the same thing you did, but for some reason had never talked about it. We all grew up and went our separate ways in life, and like most families get together on occasion and talk about the good old days."
"The Pool Incident","North Carolina","Orbs / Lights / Mists","I seem to be on a roll here but it's still early and I have time. This is my third experience I've ever had. My last story I have mistaken that as my third but I forgot this one until the end. 

 I was around 15 and it was the summer time. I had a friend two years younger than me and I often went to her house. She had a friend over that day so that makes an extra witness as well. We were all goofing around in her above ground pool. She has a little brother about 9 too. He was inside as the three of us girls were swimming. 

 Since I'm double the age that I was, now, I can't really remember who saw this first but we all three saw what looked like a flashlight going crazy inside her house. We all got out of the pool and slowly went towards the house and peaked through that sliding glass door we seen it through and we couldn't see her brother or anyone. She tried sliding the door open but it was locked. The flashlight, round light was still going crazy just circling all over the house. We were scared and just assumed someone had broken in, that was our first thought, but we never saw anyone walking around. My friend then started screaming for her little brother to come open the door for us. When he came to the door he tried yanking and just couldn't open it for us. All awhile this ball of light still moving all over that living room right behind him.

 We finally just went around the house and was able to come through the front door. The light was gone. We tiptoed around the house looking for an intruder. Searched the closets, showers, nothing. When her grandmother came home from work that was the first thing my friend mentioned was our bizarre day and the grandma had a reaction that neither of us were expecting. She started choking up and crying! She then told us that she feels in her heart that that ball of light was her mom. She said her mom said she would come back as an orb and to look for her but it had been 8 years and she hadn't seen it yet. 

 We didn't and still don't know what to think but looking back at that day, it really couldn't have been a flashlight because it was in mid air too. I just remember being so scared for our lives in the moment thinking a person was inside her house and would harm us if he knew anyone was home. But why would her great grandmother lock us out? I'm not sure what to think but if her grandma was right, it was my only orb experience."
"The Demon","North Carolina","Haunted Places","This will be my third experience I've ever had. Just a few more. It's hard to count because I keep remembering just one more then another. This was in 2009, I was 19 hanging out couch surfing friends' houses at this age. 

 I'll rename this particular friend, Miles. He lived in what my dad used to call the ""gingerbread house"" (my dad would drop me off sometimes) an adorable little home behind his grandparents. Miles and I went to high school together but didn't become friends until right after. But once we did, we hung out every single day in his tiny, cute home. For the most part things were normal and boring as teenagers are always bored but there was also not so boring parts and that's where this ""demon"" comes in...

 Miles said this demon told him that his name was Jacob and even though I was into /am into the dead, I didn't really believe him at first. He said he learned its name during a Ouija board session but I remember that night too, there was so many of us hanging out and a couple of us thought he was moving the piece... But I do know this ""demon"" which to me, was technically just a bad person when he was alive because he often messed with us... Even during the day! The memories sound so unbelievable but I was there.

 It always sounded like this ghost was in the kitchen being heavy footed, or rough, slamming things out of nowhere. More grunts than I can remember. But the most disturbing day had so many things happen all in a short amount of time. For starters, a few of us were just hanging on his couch all looking at Miles' tv screen which his computer was hooked up to so we were all just watching YouTube videos. Miles was in his computer chair and his bass guitar was leaning against his desk. No one was moving, besides the bass just randomly leans forward and does a couple spins before our eyes and goes back into it's leaning position, we all obsessed over that for a minute until right after, his pack of cigarettes which was on the desk near the bass LEVITATED maybe... Ten inches or less into the air and fell back down.

 We were all shouting ""did you see that?!"" I'm sure one kid dramatically runs around in disbelief... Rightfully so because I mean, this was not stuff you like ever see! Minutes later, A friend of ours randomly let out a sudden ""AHHHH"" and grabbed onto his ankle and immediately lifted his jean leg and there was human looking teeth marks. He was bleeding! We couldn't believe it. Pretty sure that same day another friend was pulled off of Miles' bed by his feet and did the hardest butt plop and he just ran out of the house. I witnessed this entire day. It sounds so ridiculous but I can't forget it. 

 A year after that time I was somewhat homeless yet living for only a month on a couch just one town over from Miles. There was maybe 7 of us total in this one trailer and one girl who lived there gets a call from Miles and she brought it to our attention that he was on his way over with his girlfriend to stay the night. There were already 7 of us so we were thinking why? And where will they sleep? But he showed up very shortly after.

 I remember a guy of the house opens the door and there's Miles and his girlfriend coming in to tell us that they were told to ""get out"" not just once but over and over and each time got more louder and aggressive. I'm sure half of the people there didn't believe him but after everything we've gone through, I definitely did. He said after all the stuff, this was the first he was told to leave his own home. He was shaking and just distraught. I couldn't understand how he could ever sleep there to begin with after everything he went through in that small home. 

 12 years later, we are 30 years old and Miles doesn't believe in ghosts. I just can't wrap my head around that he's denying such a time that I can never forget. Did he black all of this out? How can you be a skeptic when there was tons of witnesses in that time of his life? It's not like this was all word from his mouth but my very own eyes too and others! I know a couple other skeptics that have experiences they've shared with me but then go to say ghosts aren't real... 

 Oh my word, I just remembered a story I skipped. I was trying to go in order but I guess this was my fourth and I'll have to write my third when I have time. I knew this would happen! My third was when I was 15, so a year after my last experience. This is why I shouldn't count these."
"The Knott Family","North Carolina","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","This is my second experience I've ever had in my 30 years of living... 

 My first one I posted about three years ago, I was 4 or 5 and I was 14 on this second. It was maybe a week before Christmas break in the eighth grade. We were all about exchanging gifts among friends at school but I didn't want to wait to see my best friend at school so I showed up at her house for the first and only time ever. We lived a couple minutes from each other but in the same town. We wrote notes at school and even letters from home and of course talked on the phone a lot. She told me her house had been haunted since she could remember. That this house was well over 100 years old and it was very much haunted by an entire family! She said it was the Knott family but I've tried to do research on them and never have luck... But what I saw that one and only time was enough proof! 

 I show up because I'm impatient and wanted her to open her gifts, some nail polish and an Eminem CD. My stepmom drove me and when we knocked on her door my friend, let's rename her Becca, she didn't look happy to see me. Well probably because I wasn't invited and even though we had been friends for a whole year and really close she just didn't want people at her house. She answers the door and let's us both in, and I'll never forget my ex stepmom saying ""why are you in the dark, girl?"" And Becca quickly turned on a kitchen light and said ""I'm not trying to be"" I remember the rest of her house was pretty dark behind us. We open gifts and share a couple laughs all within just a couple of minutes of small talk.

 I had the sudden impulse to just run up her stairs. She used to describe her house to me on the phone so when I saw the staircase I ran all the way up to her room. I remember feeling lost in this big dark room and then she was right behind me while turning the overhead light on for me.

 I sat on her bed and looked and commented on her book collection and she quickly wanted to go back downstairs to where my ex stepmom was. 

I went first down the stairs and at that part where it stops and then continues to go down, I stopped to look up at her and I was like a deer in head lights. A very tall yet young like a teenage boy was standing behind her then walked into her room. It was most definitely a ghost and the one she's told me about. They often saw a grandma ghost in the living room, the husband and wife all throughout the house, upstairs in her room was this boy, and in her older sister's room was a little girl. I seen just the boy and that was all I needed to see. In that split second I'm staring up at her with my jaw hanging, she says ""I told you, you shouldn't come here""...

 I immediately pull my thoughts together and run down the stairs and all the way out the door I came in. I told my stepmom on the way home why and what happened. I called my friend that same night and we discussed it some more. She said right before we showed up she was in the kitchen with the lights flickering until it just went out. But that it did that a lot especially if you were alone. She had grown up with this ghost family that she was so used to it but knew anyone that wasn't would be stunned. I have always, even at a young age been interested in this stuff but when you're in that moment it's pretty terrifying, safe or not. I apologized for just leaving so quickly but she understood. We remained friends for the following three or four years and I was never invited back. 

 Since that was my second experience, I will never forget anything about it. The way he looked at me from behind her, to him walking into her room, maybe once was his... The scared, speechless feeling I had of being so overwhelmed. All the questions I had for her that night, I just wanted to know more. The feeling is unmatched.

 I only have a handful of experiences with seeing the dead and I have the hardest time trying to understand why not more. Or why not people really close to me like my dad or friends that have also passed... Why are they so random and not personal? Why has it been so many years in between each time? I'm not sure I'll ever know the answer to that but I do know I crave another sighting. No matter how frightening it'll be, it's definitely a thrill worth hoping for."
"Doesn't Like Me Smoking","Washington","Haunted Places","Same house only wrote NOVEMBER.

Kind of knew this guy in the back of the neighborhood who would stop by rarely. Very loud talker always hacking and coughing mid 60s. If you sat with him sometimes he would slap his hand on the table and say LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, loudly. My wife would mimic him. One of the last times I talked to him he stopped by smoking and said he had cancer. He showed me a bump on his upper belly and said cancer was pushing his innards outward. I watched cancer ravage my mother and was there when she took her last breath. I never went to visit him I wanted to remember him the way he was.

Fast forward no date. I was sneaking a cigarette out in my garage about 3.00 pm before wife got home. I finish, walk out and close door start to step up on back porch when I'm literally attacked. I step up and I'm being forced up against the house! I feel I could vomit and I'm fighting to get to the back door. I felt like 2 magnets opposite. My head is leaning away to the house. Under siege I open door and hurry to couch still ill. I sit. It's next to me because static is making my hair and arm hairs raise. It's on my right side and goose bumps. Dread feeling now and I turn and yell, ""it's none of your fXXXing business I know I got to quit!"" Then it was over, no static no sick.

 I felt like I was being warned to stop smoking. I eventually stopped smoking. YOU CAN BE ATTACKED DURING THE DAY, OUTSIDE IN YOUR OWN BACK YARD.

We feel this was him also. About 3 am one mourning drinking coffee, standing at kitchen island looking into living room when all of a sudden something hits my countertop extremely hard right next to me. I know I jumped and laughingly turned to my right and said ""do it again.""

 Nothing, I set my coffee down and opened cabinets below me - all in order.

 Go down stairs there's some daylight in the basement, so now it's kind of creepy going into the small fishing gear room with no window, it's under the kitchen - good all in order. 

I later tell wife and I hit my Corian counter top hard and barely made the noise from that early mourning, my hand kind of hurt. But I did feel it could bring me pain if it wanted to. It also realized I don't scare easy."
"Another Holiday Visit","Georgia","Photographs / Videos / EVP","I stopped by today to read some stories and felt compelled to share a couple small moments of significance that, were I to share with my husband, would just get laughed at. It's not that he doesn't believe me, but I think he just doesn't want ""ghost guy stuff"" as he calls it to gain too much of a presence in our lives (pun intended). 

On July fourth this year, I was enjoying a quiet, post-cookout evening in my cozy family room. Husband and son were downstairs watching baseball or something in the basement. I should say, July 4th was always a great holiday with my parents, at their home growing up and then for years after they moved to a nearby lake. It was at a July 4th celebration that my now-husband and I sort of fell in love, out on a boat with hundreds of other boats, watching a spectacular fireworks display right after he returned from the war in Iraq. We were so grateful he'd made it home, and feeling patriotic and in love. So July 4th is special. But we did it low key this year, and were early in, in front of our two televisions. 

So that night, I'm watching something un-memorable on the holiday, it's about 10 pm. The lights are on, and I reach for my 32 oz metal/cooler style glass of water on the coffee table. Taking a sip, out of the corner of my eye to my left, some kind of misty thing appears very briefly. At first I thought the water was so cold there was some kind of condensation coming off my glass or that I had breathed out into the cold water causing some cold steam (I don't know what that's even called). But at the same time, I got a little goosebumps feeling, enough that I was a little startled... So set my water down and took a couple photos with my phone that was right at hand. I was laughing to myself, thinking the moment had passed in any case and I was just being weird. Both photos looked completely normal, just the corner of the room and the corner of my messy coffee table. Then I realized I had the i-phone Live turned on, and when you hold your finger down it gives you a little video of about two seconds.

 In the VIDEO, there is at least one very obvious orb shooting up from the coffee table area and there is also an EVP voice heard just before the television voice that was speaking. It sounds like a young man's voice saying, ""Mom."" I was looking back through my photos yesterday and discovered this, which is why I'm writing only now. I had seen the orb in July, but didn't get the EVP until just this morning. And I can't really confirm that the voice wasn't part of the tv program. So yet another reason to be uncertain... 

I do seem to get holiday visits from loved ones (I've got my grandpa's face in a family photo from one Easter brunch) and I swear I got a phone call from my mom on my birthday the first year after she died. I'm not sure who this visit would be though. We do live on a property that was a farm on the road that Sherman marched to Atlanta upon during the Civil War. The nearby old farmhouse is said to be haunted with Civil War soldiers, and I believe our backyard (we're in the subdivision that used to be the farm) is sometimes ""occupied"" by something (my dogs often won't go out, or go out and turn tail back in to under the bed). Our pool heater also caught fire the first week it was installed, an event I'm told has NEVER happened with this pool company (but who really knows) and the pool equipment, sort of back up in the yard where I've always felt...something, is constantly breaking. Maybe we have some lingering Union soldiers or something. In any case, thought you guys might be interested. That i-phone Live thing is pretty good for ""ghost guy stuff."""
"Black Clouds Showing Off","Washington","Orbs / Lights / Mists","No time frame on these. These happened before I kept records. Same house. All in daylight hours. Sorry for purge of stories, this should be shared.

The first time I encountered a black broiling cloud I was going to put clothes in dryer. Washer and dryer are at beginning of hallway on left side and hall around 17 feet long. At the end of the hall there's a main small bathroom on the left and master bedroom on the right. The doors are across from each other. I open double door look down hall to see a black broiling cloud across the wall and in both doorways, it's less than 3 foot tall. I thought about my passed dog but I did not go near it. All interior walls are white.

2nd sighting. Again washer buzzer goes off, get to doors again look down hall and see taller cloud over 4 foot against white wall circling moving in place, still put clothes in dryer. Feel nothing bad. Not going down there.

3rd and final sighting. I only told a couple of believers of this encounter, rather embarrassing, here goes; I'm using main bathroom, I'm sitting down doing my business. I'm an adult male reading mail flier here comes BLACK CLOUD between my left arm, toilet paper roll and sink vanity that roll is hooked to. There's no room but here it comes many black colors. I don't know if it's touching me. It's a little above my head, broiling slowly, it's turning left going down in front of sink. I lean forward. It's beautiful in its own way. It's lower circling along floor in front of sink cabinet heading out the door across hall and into our bedroom back to the mirrors.

 I thought to myself now your showing off and I finished my business. The mirrors are on the other side of this bathroom. There was no bad feeling at all."
"No Eyes All Tongue","Washington","Haunted Places","May 2013 I worked a 12 hour night shift 4 on 4 off at this time, it varied, at a high pace manufacturing company in Lacey WA. I usually slept on the couch in the living room, usually watch stock market or any paranormal channel to try and fall asleep. I always leave seat reclined at my head and have my camera right next to me. I take 2 pics when I wake up, with very little movement. I have my reasons.

I usually would sleep from 6.40 am until 10. 14 am. I had a fair amount of ghost activity when I lived in this home. Next to saltwater and an island and bridge in front of my house. This particular morning I am sleeping lightly and was awakened suddenly as I'm looking strait ahead into living room and TV, I'm still laying down and in my peripheral vision I see red on me, as I span my sight I see something brown stuck in my head ear area. As I scan down I see the most brilliant red shirt like a thin T shirt and I see the bluest of blue jeans and his butt is at my hip area and the yellow stitching on the back pockets was so bright and better than like new. I do not see lower legs. As I span back up motionless I realize a young man is laying on me in the opposite direction. HOLY SHITE! I have learned Don't move Don't blink. As I look strait up (my head is still on couch I watch him pull his head out of mine The top of his head was colored a darker red like 2 inches down the side then normal brown, looked like it was just styled colors were amazing very cool cut. Buuuuttttt as he pulled his head up out of mine his face less than 12 inches from my face HE HAS NO EYES. His face is pure pinkish power, each power ball was the one quarter size of an pencil eraser like a couple thousand pink jellyfish undulating with a light behind them, holy mutha - wha the?!? I look and he is still pulling his tongue out of my head. It was the same color and seemed over 4 inches long but at the end it looked like like the shape of a root like my ear canal only 4 inches longer.

 I definitely remember in my mind, He said THEY'RE ALL WATCHING YOU, THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU and he was gone. I immediately sit up. I ALWAYS ASK THEM TO SHOW THEM SELVES AGAIN, THEY NEVER DO. This statement really bothers me. WHO'S WATCHING?

I really feel spirits were watching out for me. Thanks for reading. More to come."
"He Came Out Of The Mirror","Washington","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","JANUARY 13 2013, Sunday, watching Seahawks playoff game with Atlanta. I work at 6 pm tonight so I am propped up on my bed, only slept my usual 6.40am to 10. 14 am. I always wake at 10.14?

To my right side is my wife's side of the bed than maybe 3 feet to the 7 feet long hall to master bath. Both sides of hall are double sliding mirrored doors and bathroom door also has long mirror mounted on it, very cool looking.

 I am probably 7 feet from 1st mirrored door. Russell Wilson just passed and we lost the playoff game and our season was over. When broadcaster said we lost, I saw movement to my right and I turn my head slightly to see a long haired, good looking man with curls you could put a pop can through, slowly coming through the first mirrored door. He is looking strait ahead into mirrored door in front of him. I feel I could poop right now.

His eyes looked down, then back strait ahead - he did not move at all. I have learned from Ghost shows that you never look away or blink. I study him. He is wearing a leather jacket that's dark, the kind with open v down the front. He has a white shirt under it with a green inch and a half stripe in center of v chest area and a yellowish stripe under that of same size and white under that. Still staring strait ahead a head of brown long hair with huge curls, I am about 7 foot from him can see grey hairs in his curls, I can only see front of body and his right side pointing to me. He is around 6 foot a little less and looks like a normal living person, then he is just gone. 

'Seahawks fan, Timing, Just wanted to be seen,' are some of my impressions. I excitedly find my wife and tell her all. Came back into room to see he was standing in our air purifier that was up against door. He had looked down at other mirror.

I head off to work for the night shift. Running my machine I am thinking that ghost is 3 feet from my wife bedside and what else is coming out of the mirrors. I tell a co worker and she gives me a mediums name and I call her- Appt made.

Very nice lady records our cleansing. She said the spirit will not give his name. That his hands were very dirty, he is drinking hard alcohol, loved my wife's perfume and loved his girls (neighborhood ladies).

 Well she brought up family, my deceased dog that will be moving to Hawaii with us, and we sent him to the light.

She told me not to acknowledge or talk to these ghosts as I might pick up a bad one. I did always walk into my house and give ghost high fives and say thank you for taking care of my family. She did tell me to keep a journal of my experiences and she warned me that most people don't have sightings during daylight hours or are talked to and your a bright light to the other side so be careful. She kind of took all the fun out of ghosts by saying this stuff. 

 I drew this guy in my journal. Bottom line the colors of his clothes were amazing. A good looking man, I think he did well with the ladies. Thanks for reading. This took over 3 hours with 1 finger More to come."
"Young Man On Guard Rail","Washington","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I had no paranormal encounters that stood out between the years of 1968 and 2010, until this encounter. December 2010, about two weeks before Christmas, was getting off work at 6pm, after working a 12-hour shift. I got on the I-5 freeway, heading south, towards the first Olympia City Center exit, doing about 40mph along with traffic. It was raining. I noticed to the right of me a young man who was sitting or leaning against a short guard rail. He looked to be in his 20s?, wearing dark blue jeans, blue vest, darker long-sleeved shirt, had long hair (reminded me of how I dressed in the 70s). I noticed when I saw him that he was not wet and it was raining. I noted he had a dead stare, looking straight ahead at traffic.

I continue to look his way and when I get where I think I would be even with him, I realized he wasn't wet and then he just disappeared. The guard rail was part of an overpass that went over me on the freeway, with a fairly deep ravine on the other side of the guard rail. When I got home, I told my wife about the dry guy in the rain that disappeared, and that I thought he may have passed along freeway somehow and needed help. My wife looked on the computer for any deaths that may have occurred along that overpass. A picture came up that showed a young man that had passed in this area, but he did not look like the guy I saw. 

I felt I had to go take a look to see if I could help and put this to rest. I had to go to the next exit, up from where I saw him, in order to enter the easement to get back down to where I thought he was. I didn't want to park along the freeway to stomp around. The area where I entered was known to be a hot spot for local homeless, drug users, and pan handlers next to the on and off-ramps of I-5. I was worried for my safety and not owning a gun, I took a wood pick handle with me and went to comb I-5 along this ditch area and stayed on property along the fence line. I walked along as far as I could and did not find anything of interest, no bones or bodies. The winter grass was very low, so it was easy to see the ground while searching. I was greatly relieved to not find anything. Still had to find guard rail area without going through anyone's yard.

I later took my wife with me on the weekend to go perform a search again of the area. We drove around in the general area and found a road that led us downhill into a neighborhood to where we came upon a dead end street that faced the freeway approximately where I saw the young man. We parked and got out and my wife took pictures with her camera, but we didn't see anything, nothing odd came up on the camera. We we were leaving that neighborhood, we saw a small cemetery that we didn't know was there. We didn't get out and look, as we didn't want to take the chance of any clingers. I thought maybe this young man was connected with this small cemetery. This was my first paranormal experience in approximately 43 years, since my childhood experience with the Couple in the Cloud. After this encounter with the young man on the guard rail, and installing mirrored double closet doors across from each other in our small master bath hallway and mirror on bathroom door, we started having more experiences. Mostly me in daylight hours."
"Couple In The Cloud","Washington","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","It all began while living in Olympia, Washington, around 1966, when I was approximately 6 years old. My family of five lived in a mobile home that was very small and my Mother had to sleep in the living room. My older brother and I shared a room.

 On many occasions early in the morning, such as 2 or 3 a.m., I would wake to noises, then a pure white cloud would come out of the corner of the room above me with the faces of a dark-haired lady and man. I don't remember seeing shoulders and the noises were not normal and very strange and unrecognizable, as well as loud. 

Often when this happened, I would try to waken my older brother, but he just snored louder and never woke up. I was very afraid during these instances and usually pulled the covers over my head until I would run out of the room, down the hall to where my Mom was sleeping. When I would look back, the cloud would be coming down the hall, sideways (so strange, like they couldn't come head on). I would yell,"" Mama, do you see them Mom?"" She would say, ""no, there's no one there, David. Climb in bed with me."" 

When I was around 11 years old, I began to realize that the ghostly images were laughing and having fun at my expense because I could see them, but at 6 years old, it was very scary. The ghostly woman had very puffy high hair with high curls on her head like in the old days. The man's head was lower in the cloud than the woman's and was shaped like a football with hardly any hair. I can still remember their faces after 54 years. 

In 2014, I drove across town to go to the old trailer court on Martin Way Road. The trailer spot was about 4th in from the main road, and there was no trailer in the spot, if I remembered correctly. I didn't really recognize anything except for a missing tree. I managed to speak with the trailer court manager and told him about the ghosts and pointed to the lot and that I would like to talk to some people near it and possibly do some night recording. He asked me if I was crazy, and said, ""this is a retirement community now and I can't have you coming in and making people think about ghosts.""

 I wanted to share this story and put it to rest. I have many more to share at a later date. Thank you for reading."
"Freaky Experience","Hawaii","Orbs / Lights / Mists","This story happened when I was around 11 years old; on Oahu in Hawaii. My family and I lived in base housing on Wheeler Air Force Base. 

One day I was riding my skateboard around the neighborhood and I noticed a crowd of kids and a military police car in front of a house. As I approached the house I could see the lights up stairs going on and off. The lights were going on and off repeatedly. As I entered the house, I saw a military policeman standing on the stairs and he had his billy club out and he wasn't going up the stairs. I asked him "" Hey, sir, what did you find in the room upstairs with the lights going on and off?""

 He told me ""There is nobody up there."" I said ""what do you mean there is nobody up there? How are the lights going on and off?""

 He said ""I searched the whole house upstairs and I did not find anybody!"" He also said ""I don't know, why don't you go up there because I am not moving from this spot! Something isn't right! I have called my sergeant in charge to come up here to see for himself!""

 I crept up the stairs slowly and I entered the bedroom where the lights were going on and off. I saw and heard the light switch clicking back and forth. I stayed in that room for about 1 minute! None of my friends wanted to go with me to investigate! I then went down the stairs and I told the military policeman I saw no one at all the bedroom was empty! I think maybe it was caused by a mad ghost or maybe a bad Ouija board experience? Please advise. Thanks for reading my story!"
"Spitting Phenomenon And More","New York","Haunted Places","When I was 12 years old in the early 1970's, I experienced a very strange happening that I don't share with too many people I know because I'd sound crazy.

 I was in my bedroom and brushing my long hair while looking in a large mirror above my dresser. I heard a hissing sound and saw something coming from my bed area across the room and then felt it touch the hair on the left side of my head. It then hit my mirror and looked like phlegmy spit as it dripped down the mirror. I screamed and my parents came running into my room.

 It was totally unexplainable. I had been alone in my room. My parents were baffled. They didn't make a big deal about it.

 I went on to have other unexplainable experiences in my childhood house for several years. I saw an image in my den that looked like a ghostly image of a woman with long red hair walking past the room I was in. Another experience that my parents searched the lower level of the house I was in and found nothing.

 Many years after moving out of the house, my older brother told me he saw a similar image looking down the stairs to the lower level. I also would hear a faint women's voice calling out my name several times during my youth. There was only one time that someone else heard it (my younger brother).

 I came upon this website while watching a poltergeist tv show. I was amazed that my experiences were similar to other people's experiences. I've had less frequent experiences as an adult. Strange phenomenon still happen randomly when I least expect. I'm Catholic and feel safe when I pray. Feels good to share my experience."
"Black Mass","North Carolina","Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis","It's been quite some time now, since I have posted another one of my experiences here, so I figured it's finally time that I write this one, which I have been wanting to share for awhile now, before I forget too many details about it.

I can't remember exactly if it was this past Spring, or the end of Winter, but it was around that time period of this year, when this experience had happened. 

It was night time, and I was getting ready to go to sleep, with my husband already sleeping next to me, and my daughter was still up in the living room.

As I was about to lay down (I'm in bed, in the sitting position, before you lay back to go to sleep), I noticed the feeling I started to feel, when I know that there is something around me (meaning spirit of some kind), and being in the dark at the time, didn't make me feel too comfortable knowing that there was something watching me, that I could not see in my room. 

I could feel that whatever was there, was at the foot of my bed, which is in front of my bedroom door. The door was closed, but with my daughter still up, and in the living room, there was light coming in from the bottom crack of the door. I was thinking to myself, that I don't want to look too hard and see something that I don't want to see, but still decided to look at the foot of my bed, and noticed this black mass looking thing, in the corner of where my tv stand and bedroom door are. I just told myself that I was probably seeing wrong, and that it wasn't really anything there. So I just hurried up and laid back, to try and go to sleep, and ignore what I just saw at the foot of my bed. 

As I was laying in bed, trying to go to sleep, I remember hearing what I thought was my daughter coming in the room, to climb in bed with us, and waited for her to start to get in bed, but when I didn't feel her do so, I looked up to see what she was doing, and saw that she wasn't in the room. I laid back down thinking how weird that was, because I could have swore I heard her open our door, and come in. 

Eventually I fell asleep, and I still remember the nightmare I had that night. I have 5 ducks as our pets, that we love and spoil a lot. I take great care in looking after them, to where I even make sure to lock them up in their homes at night, to keep them safe from predators out here, living in the middle of the woods. Anyways, my point being, I care very much about them and their safety. That night I had a bad dream of them being hurt somehow, and me freaking out and screaming and crying over finding some of them dead, and the others hurt. Not knowing what had happened to them. 

My husband ends up waking me up from this nightmare, because he said I was making noises in my sleep, that sounded like I was having a bad dream. I'd like to add that I don't normally make noises in my sleep, so this isn't something that happens often. I told him I was so glad he woke me up, because I was having a horrible dream. I was still very tired, and could barely hold my eyes open, as I was sitting up in bed, continuously dosing in and out, fighting myself to go back to sleep, in fear that I would start back up in that dream again.

After however long I was doing that (which roughly was under 5 minutes), my husband asked what was I dreaming, and after telling him, he began to tell me that I had woken him up to making the noises in my sleep, when he noticed as his eyes started to adjust to the dark room, that there was what he described to look like a black mass, hovering over me as I was sleeping, and freaked him out to see, staring at it, to figure out if he is seeing correctly or not. He said that's when he woke me up, and saw the black mass move from above me, across to the other side of the room. He said as I was sitting up, he saw it start to come back towards me, and get close, and then back up a little, and come back towards me, when he finally had asked me about what I had dreamed, it just disappeared. 

I told him how freaky that was to hear, because I couldn't keep my eyes open, and it seemed like it was trying to mess with me again, when I kept dosing in and out. Making me wonder what it would have done, if I had gone back to sleep then?

I told him that it was most likely what was making me have my bad dream then, since it was hovering over me while I was having it. Like it somehow was affecting my dream. I told him that it was creepy how he had also described what he had saw, as a black mass, because I then told him that I had saw the same thing, at the end of the bed, near the door, right before I went to sleep. Which he was unaware of at that time, so for him to describe seeing the same thing that I had saw, made me think I really did see something near our door. 

Now whenever I have bad dreams like that, I can't help but wonder if that black mass is above me again or not. My husband hasn't seen that above me since, but that doesn't mean it hasn't came back though. It's not like he is always watching me during my sleep. 

Normally my husband is the one that is affected while sleeping by whatever, because he has had many sleep paralysis episodes, and has seen and felt something messing with him, waking him up. So he was surprised to see it messing with me this time. 

I keep wondering what it was, and why it seemed to be making me have bad dreams? Like it somehow feeds off of that or something. I don't know, maybe it wasn't affecting my dream, but for whatever reason, was hovering above me. It's just weird how it didn't go away when I woke up, but only across the room, and then started to get close to me again, when I started to fall back asleep.

Maybe someone here might know what that was about? It's not like this happens a lot to me though, so I don't know what to think about it."
"My Indian","Virginia","Haunted Places","I would like to begin this story with a bit of a disclaimer regarding the title and my use of the term ""Indian"" - I use it here as this story involves a dear friend of mine and it is the term used by her people and her perspective, I feel, is integral to the scenario. If the term is offensive to some readers, I do apologize, it is absolutely not intended as such.

I have worked as an artists' model for fourteen years - long before I went full freelance - my friend Anne was the first artist I had ever worked for privately... To be honest, the notion had never even crossed my 20 year old mind at the time and had it been any one other than her (a sweet faced woman my mother's age and even from the same region of North Carolina hill country as my mother's parents), the idea of going over to a veritable stranger's home to sit about attired in little more than a bedsheet while they drew or painted me (as opposed to a structured classroom setting) would have seemed truly alarming (amazing, how things normalize as you get more experience in a field -hah!). 

I still remember the first evening I drove to her little house after getting off work for a planned sitting. Her home is in James City County in between the two historic former capital cities (Williamsburg and Jamestown) in a small older development whose name, as many, reflects the history Native American presence in the area. The house itself sits in a deep gully - so much so that on approaching from the street, all you can see of it is a mailbox at the street's edge until you look very closely and realize through the trees that from where you sit on the street you are well above the level of the roof. The driveway (much to my chagrin as, by that age, I had only been driving for mere months... I was a late bloomer in many things, driving being one of them) is pitched at about a 45 degree angle (I'm trying to be conservative with that estimate because, believe me, it feels far steeper) and of pebble gravel. All around, there are tall slim trees that wave in the breeze. 

That evening, we had a lovely time, chatting and joking as she drew and making Coke-a-Cola floats. By the time it was time for me to go, it was around 9:30 in the evening and darkness had fallen. Heading out the door, I was already keenly dreading having to navigate that driveway with my fledging driving skills...backwards...up the rutted gravel hill... In the dark. So I tried to dismiss the jarringly foreboding feeling of being steadily watched as I flounced out the door from an evening happily spent. Just the same, it felt like being splashed full in the face with a bucket of cold water so grave was the change in feelings between inside and out. I made my way to the car with my eyes cautiously trained on the woods to my right - fearful of what I might see as I just knew that whatever it was, it was watching me from those woods... The woods that surrounded and seemed to all but swallow up the little house in the pit of the gully. Every footfall in the gravel seemed to shatter the silence. I was holding my breath, my hand trembling when I finally reached my car door, yanked it open, hopped inside, slammed and locked the door, flicked it on and filled the drive at least with the comforting glow of my headlights. Sitting there for a moment, I thought how silly I was to have let my anxiety surrounding the reverse journey up the precipitous drive get my goat like that. Resolutely, I put my little coupe in reverse and carefully powered up the dark drive and away towards the comfort of street lights and civilization. 

Everything in me wanted to chalk the feeling up to anxiety about reversing up that crazy driveway; and yet, every time I went back, the feeling was just as strong and just as frightening as I left her door in the dark. You would think that I would, over time, develop some degree of confidence reversing up that hill and those fears would subside and, I did feel far more confident every time, soon as my car door closed shutting me in and away from the eyes in those woods. The fearful feeling only existed in the space between her front door and my car and subsided the moment I was inside my locked car. I returned to Anne's house that fall, winter, and spring almost once per week. And though our sessions slowed a bit, we continued to meet not just for art's sake but to hang out as friends many times over the years. The feeling leaving her home never changed. Something was in those woods. Something was out there watching. Something strong. Something very powerful.

One weekend, I stayed with her as I was working with several photographers in the area and, though my home is within an hour of Williamsburg, it still was far more convenient to stay with her so that I didn't have to get up at four in the morning to get ready and then get to my morning shoots - and it gave us an excuse to have a sleepover and watch movies we'd been meaning to get to for months. This was my first time sleeping in that little house - it really is a charming place filled to the gills with her lovely art and artifacts from her life. The guest room is in the second story loft with an attached full bathroom. Sometime around ten, I made my way upstairs to get ready for bed. After finishing my evening routine, my head hit the pillow and I started trying for sleep as I tend to have a hard time getting to sleep away from home but knew that I needed to get at it if I was going to look my best in the morning. As I laid there, I began to hear footsteps. Mind you, the window was open but she lives in a fairly rural area - I even got up and looked - there was a floodlight that stayed on all night so the visibility was pretty good and there was no one and nothing out there. In fact, it was far quieter than one would expect a country night to be - no chirping bugs or rustling of critters... Just the footsteps, very measured, very clearly human footsteps circling the yard. I could hear them coming so close to the house below the window that it would have been impossible for me not to have seen whoever was making those footsteps. After gazing into the half dark for almost thirty minutes trying to puzzle out those footsteps, I finally closed the window and gave it up. With a sense of unease just like what I felt going out that door in the dark to my car, I laid my head on the pillow and finally managed to sleep.

The next night, started the same way - the weather was too cool for the air conditioner but too warm to be fully comfortable without the windows open. So, with my fingers crossed, I opened the window and got in bed... And there they were again... The footsteps. Around and around the yard - this time pausing beneath the window now and then as if to look up. I couldn't take it, I hopped up and slammed the window shut. Getting back in bed feeling more than a bit uneasy, I laid there staring at the ceiling praying for sleep to come before anything else happened. No such luck. Within minutes, the footsteps were back... And now, they were inside my room. The circled the bed, went into the bathroom, I could hear rustling in there, then they came back out again and roamed the room again. I laid there positively petrified - they circled and circled now and then pausing, now and then rustling something here or there. Finally, I had reached the end of my courage, rolled over and flicked on the lights. Of course, there was nothing there and nothing amiss. I slept with the light on for the rest of the night. 

The next morning, over coffee, I finally came clean to Anne about the footsteps and the feeling of being watched in the drive. She smiled and laughed ""That's my Indian!""...What?!?!? Evidently, when she first moved in, she had experienced some of the same things (and continued to occasionally) - eventually, she had an acquaintance over who was a psychic - she told her that a Native American was buried somewhere on her property. He was not of a local tribe but had travelled from his home land only to meet with death in this place. She didn't know what tribe he was from or where - she couldn't get that much detail as he wasn't too keen on communicating with her - but she said he ""hung out"" most often in the corner of her guest room and roamed the woods. I can't say knowing what had been disturbing my sleep made me feel much better about the whole thing.

Several months later, she was kind enough to put my husband up as he had to work an event nearby. I didn't tell him about her permanent house guest - I didn't want to spook him and we live next to a mass grave anyway so I figured it wasn't anything he couldn't handle. When he returned Sunday night, he had a story of his own. Not only had he sensed a presence in the corner and heard the footsteps circling his bed but the light in the bathroom had flicked on and off all night and the taps had turned on and off on their own at least twice.

Anne and I are friends to this day. Needless to say, I don't tend to spend the night there all that often!"
"Man In The Driveway","Michigan","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","My son & his beautiful wife were looking for their first home. He wanted as much acreage as he could get. So we found this home that sits so far off the road that you cannot even see it. The owner had passed away and this house had sat vacant for at least 10 years. It was the right price so we were excited & happy for it.

When it was still for sale, my daughter in law and I made a trip out there alone to walk around the property and peer in the windows. We were peering in the windows and we realized the sliding door was not locked. I opened the door and yelled in hello. We stepped in and looked around a bit but the house was big, we got scared and went back outside to look around. 

We were walking back on the property. The grass started to get so tall we decided to go back. We turned around and we both saw a tall man standing in the driveway looking right at us. But he faded away very quickly like 1,2,3 and gone. I asked did you see that? She said the man in the driveway and I said yes. We both decided it was the sunlight playing tricks on our eyes. We walked back up to the house and opened the slider again. My daughter in law yelled in hello but this time the hello echoed back at us. Neither of us wanted to step into the house we left. 

They went ahead and bought the big house with the land my son wanted so badly. Right away we started cleaning. The house had been a duplex and they turned it back to a single family home. It was so full of dirt they didn't move in right away. One night everyone was at work and I was at their home painting alone. I started to hear noises in the basement. I went outside to my car which was a walk in pitch black. I got in my car and saw that the light in the other side of house had gone on. I decided not to investigate and left.



I often go there to help. On one trip I was mowing down near the road and I met the neighbor. I told her of some of the stuff we found strange about my son's new home and this lady tells me to check out the front step. She says, ""flip that white marble step up. It's a Tomb Stone."" I did not believe her. So when I finished mowing down by the road, I headed right up to the house. I looked at the white marble step. Awww she is trying to spook me. It looked like a step to me, we had been using it as such. I pushed on it. I could not budge it. My son came out and asked me what I was doing. 

I told my son what the neighbor had said. My son is big and strong he pulled that heavy white marble step up and it was a Tomb Stone of a Military Veteran. It no longer looked like a step at all. It had the name date and everything on it. Why was it being used as a step and is this the man we saw in the driveway? The name on the tombstone is not the name of the previous owner. The tombstone is much older from World War 1. We have googled the name. We have not been able to find out anything so far. We still have the tombstone there on the front porch. We will probably put it someplace on the property. The house has begun to feel like their home. I'm hoping that the entity we saw in the driveway was saying goodbye. My son has a big German Shepherd and he feels safe & comfortable in the home. My beautiful daughter in law wants to move already.

 I don't know if this is a bad sign. But there were snakes everywhere in the yard around the house. One snake slithered right onto my foot. I am afraid of snakes. I looked down saw the snake on my open shoe. I screamed so loud it sounded like someone else was screaming to me. And I ran. The snake landed between my feet and we were both going the same direction. Never has that happened to me ever and I live in the country too. The snakes are mostly gone now. But I still wear boots now when I visit."
"Rusty Trying To Reach Me?","South Carolina","Misc","It has been quite a while since I last submitted a story. But then again I haven't had any over the real encounters in a few years either.

Honestly, I started not to even submit this story because I felt that it wasn't all that significant, but what happened was pretty interesting nonetheless. It is at least worth noting.

Okay, a few days ago (this past early Sunday morning around 4am or so) I was reading through a few ghost stories on this site (I don't post anymore but I do visit this site occasionally to check out stories during my past time). 

There was one I happened upon titled 'No Peace For Rusty'.

Just in case you haven't checked it out, it's about a young teenager named Edward ""Rusty"" Riddle who committed suicide by gunshot at Taylorsville High in Salt Lake City, Utah. I just gave a brief synopsis. I posted the title already so all you have to do is find it and read through it for yourself.

Anyway, as I was reading the person's encounter with ""Rusty"" I found it quite intriguing, so I went and did a little research of my own via Google to find out more info on this poor restless soul. 

After reading Rusty's obituaries following the ghost story about him I was starting to feel a bit sorry for him, ya know.

Within a few minutes of feeling sorry for the guy I started to feel not necessarily a ""presence"", but I felt what I can describe as ""energy"" or ""emotions"" that weren't mine.

After thinking about it for a second I immediately knew that ""Rusty"" was trying to impress his emotions on me being as I had just started feeling sorrow for his soul and looking through his online obituaries. 

After a few more minutes is when I started to feel the actual presence beginning to manifest. The area of the room I was laying in starting to become a bit cold.

At the time there was a family member (Not going to say who) laying down asleep on the floor in my room, so I definitely didn't want anything like that happening while they were around.

At that point I said somewhat out loud ""No, No!"", ""Uh Uh!"", ""I'm not trying to manifest any spirits around here!"" - or some things to that same effect. I then closed out of the browser tabs that had Rusty's ghost story and the obituaries I was viewing.

A few minutes after I said that the presence and energy started to fade away.

I admit, I was pretty startled because of how intense the feelings were getting, especially considering that the guy in the story experienced the SAME THING! But I wasn't like on edge or scared or anything like that.

Over the past several years I've had experiences where I would be talking to someone about spirits, especially my dad, and we would start feeling a presence around us. From that I've learned that spirits are around us all the time and you can literally talk them up, think them up, or even ""feel"" them up. The realm of spirit knows no boundaries.

I guess in this case Rusty must've wanted to connect with me to let me know the pain that he is probably STILL feeling for what he has done to himself. I hope his soul finds peace, but that was a pretty creepy experience. Lol.

Just thought I'd share this!"
"He Brought Her To Me","Michigan","Family / Friends Visits","As we continue to live in this ""unique"" time, my hope for you all is to be safe. Crazy times! 

I have mentioned before that I lost my dad a bit over 10 years ago and my mom passed July 2. She suffered from dementia for about 5 years but the last 3 of her life was devastating. It's been the longest good bye for us! I live a thousand miles away and with this pandemic was unable to go see her before she passed. My mom would've told me to stay home and stay safe! She would not have wanted there to be a fuss. I find comfort in the fact I was able to spend a week with her back in November and accept that was the last time I would see her, physically that is. Over the last few months of her life I dreamed of her frequently. Often, my dad was also in these dreams. I strongly believe that he was waiting for her. My sister, who took care of my mom until the end, told me mom was always talking to someone at night. She kept a baby monitor in her room in case mom needed something. My sister could never make out what she was saying or who she was talking to. 

Fast forward to her passing. I dreamed A LOT about my sister after she passed (26 years ago) and I've also dreamed of my dad. Since mom's been gone I've been waiting for a dream about her. Mind you, not just any dream but the ""visitation"" type of dream. Well, it finally happened.

 In my dream, I was riding in the car with mom and dad. He was driving and mom was in the passenger seat. I sat directly behind mom and they were discussing something. We pulled into the driveway where they used to live and got out. Mind you, this was a lake house that my parents built and our family had MANY happy times there. All the grand kids still tell wonderful stories of that lake house. So, while mom and dad were talking, she called dad Lloyd, which was not his name. This resonated with me because mom used to call my son George when he was little and he always told her, ""Grandma, I'm not George!"" She did it just to give him a hard time and we always laughed. 

In my dream, I was about to remind her of this when it hit me, she's gone! I grabbed my mom and hugged her so tight and literally sobbed, telling her how much I love and miss her! I felt her in my arms and felt my body sob so hard! 

As I sadly woke up, I remembered dad standing there while I hugged mom and I know, he brought her to me!"
"A Different Kind Of Work Experience","Ohio","Haunted Places","It's been five years since I last posted an update on here. Quite a bit has happened in that time. I'll start with a brief update to my last post. As I said in the last post, in 2014 I moved from Texas to Ohio. I'd said that a room in our house was feeling odd to us and was cold and we felt uneasy in there. After I posted the entry, we found out that the previous owner had passed away in the room. I asked my pastor to pray in the room, and after that the room felt fine. My roommates were freaked out by it still, so since I had the smallest room in the house and that was the biggest room, I moved into it. I didn't experience anything in that room while I lived in it.

On 28 January 2016, I moved into my own apartment. I lived there for a year and didn't experience anything paranormal while living there. Which I was actually kind of disappointed about because that place had been there since the '70s, so I kind of expected something to be there. Lol

At the end of my first lease at the beginning of 2017, I moved in with a friend because it'd be cheaper. My rent had gone up and I couldn't afford it there anymore. While I didn't experience much paranormal there, we did occasionally hear weird noises in parts of the house neither of us would be in at the time. Could have just been normal sounds, but we would joke that it was ghosts. The weirdest thing about that house was that there was this creepy doll shoved upside down into a hole in the roof of the cabinet above the stove. He said it was there when he moved in and was too afraid to touch it. I've seen Annabelle, I wasn't touching it.

On 18 July 2019, I moved into a big mansion, renting a room. It was closer to where everything was. Even though the house is like a hundred years old, I haven't experienced anything paranormal here in the year and three months I've lived here. Oh, it definitely gives off the creepy vibes because it's so old, but I haven't actually experienced anything here. In preparation of writing this, I asked around and neither has anyone else.

Backtrack to 2015, I got a job working as a dishwasher at a restaurant. People would tell me that the place was haunted. I'd laugh at them because of course it is. But shortly after I started working there, I started seeing things out of the corner of my eye that'd be gone when I looked. I just assumed I was imagining things. But a few times, I literally saw apparitions appear in front of me.

I'll talk about the three biggest occurrences. The first one, there was a metal thing on wheels that the bread racks would sit on. It's just a metal square with wheels that we'd put the bread racks on. It's supposed to be against the wall, and it was. But as I was closing one day, I stepped back from the dish line and tripped over it. My first thought wasn't ghost, because I think it's healthy to be skeptical about things like that and not just assume everything is a ghost. So it didn't even cross my mind. I went to the manager and told him that someone left the bread rack thing sitting out and that I tripped over it, because it was a safety violation. He checked the camera to see who did it so he could write them up. As I was clocking out ten minutes later, he called me in the office and showed me the video. It was by the wall and on it's own moved across the room behind me. When I tripped over it, it'd been there for seconds. I took out my phone to film it and he told me not to because ""corporate wouldn't like that"".

Another time, I was bussing tables and out of the corner of my eye I saw this little girl staring at me from the next table over. There was this elderly couple sitting there so I figured they brought their granddaughter. But I decided to wait until I finished bussing the table to wave at her (the kids like it when we wave at them), so I ignored her until I was done. But when I finished, I waved at her and she was gone. It was just the elderly couple sitting there. I was thinking that maybe she ducked under the table, but there wasn't even a plate there where she would have been. I asked their server and she said there was no little girl.

The third biggest thing to happen there was again at close. All I had left was to put the last of the dishes out in the front of the store and I was done. So I pushed the dish cart out to the salad bar, which I always used as like a central base thing and distributed the dishes to the rest of the restaurant from there instead of wheeling the heavy dish cart everywhere. I looked into the dark atrium and saw a little girl standing on a booth seat. I let out a sigh, set the dishes in my hands down, and walked to the atrium. She was gone. I rolled my eyes, got on my hands and knees and looked under the booth, and the other booths. No one. I was confused, but after a few seconds it connected and I ran into the office and told the manager. Unfortunately there's no camera back there, but he believed me. As I said, everyone had seen things.

I started a job at a convenience store on 27 September 2019, and quit the restaurant on 31 December 2019. Didn't want to quit until I knew I'd be able to last at the store. I was working third shift, so naturally it was a real creepy vibe to begin with. But for the most part, there wasn't much going on. Both in terms of customers and the paranormal. But one day, a coworker and I were sitting down having lunch (at 3am... Third shift is weird) and we heard the cooler door slam shut. We looked at each other and both ran to the back to check. No one was there. But then I decided to test to see if it could slam on it's own. I opened it and let it go. It softly closed, but didn't latch. I slammed it, but it stopped at the latch and didn't even make the slam noise we heard. The only way to get it to make that sound was when I pushed it all the way closed hard. My coworker and I were creeped out. Another night, she and I were talking and heard children running and laughing through the aisles when there wasn't anyone there.

On 6 July 2020, my store closed for remodel and I transferred to one closer to my house. This store... I don't know what happened here, but it's actively active. Everyone who works there sees things. There seems to be a specific spot that's the most active. When you enter the store, straight ahead like two hundred-ish feet is the door to the office. Turn left and there's a narrow hallway with all the storage (cups, candy, etc) for another two hundred-ish feet. At the end of that narrow hallway is a small room. On one side is the door to the freezer. Across from that is the door to the cooler. That room... That room is the most active. We'll be in the office and look down the hallway and see someone look around the corner, but no one will be back there. I've assumed coworkers were back there because I'd see someone round the corner, but then everyone will be out front.

There have been a few things happen in the main part of the store. One night, it was just a coworker and I and we were discussing the building being haunted, and as we were talking a bag of chips was thrown off the shelf. It didn't fall off and land directly in front. It landed like five feet in front of it. We decided to change the subject.

Tonight, that same coworker and I were cashing out customers when the door alarm went off. If the cooler or freezer door is left open for fifteen minutes, a loud alarm will go off. My coworker had been in the freezer and swore that she closed it. When I went back there it was wide open. I took a picture and showed her and she goes, ""I swear I closed it!"", and I laughed at her. Later tonight, she and I were sitting in the office talking when the door alarm went off. We looked at each other in confusion. Neither of us had been in there in the last couple hours. We looked down the hallway and the freezer door was wide open.

I'd been thinking about writing this entry for the last couple weeks. Logged in for the first time in five years, but I kept procrastinating. Tonight when that happened, I decided that I needed to write it.

I guess I'll be back in another five years? Lol"
"Night Knocker","Michigan","Haunted Places","Many years ago, I was separated from my husband and living alone in our remote Michigan country home. This weekend our children were at his home staying with him. I had worked a long International 3 day trip and had commuted home from Chicago O'Hare. It was late when I arrived home tired. I took my luggage in dropping it by the front door. I grabbed a snack and answered a call from a relative. Then I headed straight to the bathroom and drew a hot bubble bath. I shut the shades before getting into the tub even though there is nothing but woods behind my home for 3 miles. 

I was relaxing in the hot water when I was jolted alert by hard banging on my front door. The outside screen door was metal and the noise it made was very loud, it traveled down the halls and through the closed bathroom door. It continued with a urgency bang, bang bang in threes the loud knocking went. I grabbed a towel and feeling annoyed at the rude loud knocking, I thought to myself only my mother would knock so loudly and she's probably not alone so I better get dressed. I quickly put my uniform back on. I went to the front door and as I turned the corner the knocking stopped suddenly.

 As I reached for the door handle to throw open the door, the hair on my neck went up. I felt a cold chill go over me and a sudden feeling of doom. I pulled my hand away from the door handle and up to the door shade to peer out into the night. I expected to see my mother but my porch was empty. I turned on the light and looked out my driveway was empty. I looked to my right at my other driveway to my barn it too was empty. I picked up my phone and called my mother as I peered from my entranceway out into the night. I told my mother what had happened as I stood there looking out into the night.

 As we spoke behind me I heard the sound of my hall closet door handle turning ever so slowly and I turned to see it swing open. I screamed so loud that my mother yelled is someone killing you. I said no the closet just opened on its own. She told me to go look inside. My legs did not want to move. I was about 8 feet from the closet. I was finally able to look in. It was full of Coats & such no room for a real person in there. My heart was racing. I was now fearful and I called my neighbor to shine his lights on my house. He drove down it took him a long 15 minutes, my mother stayed on the phone with me until he arrived. I did not investigate, I grabbed my suitcase still by the door while my neighbor who lived 2 miles away was in my driveway. I got in my Tahoe and left. Whatever it was that night, felt evil."
"Normal House, Far From Normal Night","California","Haunted Places","This is the first time that I've posted anything online about this event in my life. I've told some close friends about it--my mother as well--but only the people involved with the owners of the house trusted me in what happened. This is the only event in my life that I have no explanation for.

A bit about me:

I was born in England in 1992, and lived a good life there regardless of my parents divorce when I was three years old. My mom met my stepdad when I was around four years old, and she was married within a year. I'm lucky to have two people to call dad! When I was five, we moved to Rhode Island due to my stepdad's advancing job. It was unfortunate that I had to leave my real father and family behind; I loved them very much. I say ""loved"" because I've grown up and lived in America since then, and the distance has caused me to become quite apart from my family back home. At the age of nine, my stepfather's job had us move to Orange County, California, where I've lived ever since. When we first came to Orange County, my parents purchased a house in a city called Rancho Santa Margarita (I believe this city held a record for the longest name for a good while) and we started our life again in California. I grew up on a street called Obispo, in R.S.M. CA until I was 15 and we moved. Consequently, I ended up going to a different high school than all of my friends. 

Getting to the story:

This story begins with growing up on Obispo street. It was a perfectly normal upper-middle class area constructed in the 90's. There were lots of kids my ages living on that street during the time that I lived there, and I had great fun with them--even if sometimes I felt that I didn't quite fit in. My parents being British made me a bit different to the rest. I lived there from ages 9-15 approximately. There was this girl that I knew (I won't say any names) that I used to play with further down that street. We used to have little ""wars"" using berry shooters (pvc pipe with a balloon taped around one side that allowed us to launch various projectiles, namely berries) and would generally be quite mean to each other--in a childish sense. I remember one time when I planted a ""fart bomb"" in their garage that I had purchased from the ice cream man which I got into quite a bit of trouble for after her father realized it was me. That girl and I ended up going to different middle schools.

During this time living on Obispo, I never caught any wind of any oddities happening. It wasn't until years after I had moved that I began to hear about weird things happening there. At around the age of 16, after I had since moved away from that street, I met the girl I had once played with. We both seemed so grown up. It turned out that we had mutual friends, and would hang out from time-to-time. When I started college, my parents moved back to Rhode Island--once again due to my dad's job. I was left alone to my own devices, which was a bad thing for me. I wasn't able to keep up with my studies, and flunked out of school. I just wasn't ready, and far too immature at the time. I moved in with a college friend of mine, in fact my best friend of today. We had great fun, and each had a dog. Mine was called Damien. He was just a puppy of a few months when this all happened. 

I remember during my mid-teens I used to hang out with the girl from the old street Obispo and her friends from my group. They (and she) would tell me about weird events that had happened at her (my old friend's) house on Obispo. One of the friends would tell me that her reflection didn't seem like her when she was over at that house. They also told me about a dark figure that crawled from the downstairs guest room to the guest bathroom (right next to each other, but separate rooms). Apparently one of their guy friends had spent the night there in the guest room downstairs and left in the early morning. He supposedly told them the next day that he has seen this thing crawling. The girl (my old friend) would tell me of odd happenings and trouble sleeping. She always seemed serious when mentioning these things to me, but I never took any of it to heart. Her and our other friends were into odd things, and I know that they liked ghosts and vampires and such. I never took them seriously since I knew that they took easily to the fantasy world of things. I have always loved watching ghost shows and the likes, but as a natural skeptic I never really believed in anything paranormal. I was also raised without any faith. I paid no serious attention to anything her and her friends had mentioned, although their stories were interesting.

Around the age of 19-20 she invited me to her house. We were alone, just the two of us--nothing romantic--and my puppy Damien. Her parents had gone somewhere together and her younger brother was off galivanting god knows where for the weekend. Once the movie was over, she went off to sleep in her parents room upstairs, and I went to the upstairs bonus room at the other side of the house. These two rooms were far apart from each other, facing through a long hallway that allowed access to every other upstairs room in the house. The bonus room where I was laying down was above the garage; the parents room was facing the backyard. There was two French doors that opened inwards to the bonus room that I was staying, with a cold leather couch offset but facing those doors. There was a large flat-screen T.V. Sitting on a large stand that housed books/dvds and such to the right of those French doors. Behind the couch was the rest of the room; there was a large window back there showing the street leading to Obispo. I popped on the tele while snuggling Damien on that couch facing the T.V. And flicked through the channels. I don't rightly remember what I was watching as time went on. I was tired, but I wasn't yet ready to go to sleep and kept watching the tele. 

Suddenly something banged against those double doors I was facing. It was INCREDIBLY loud, as if the police were about to burst in. The doors shook inwards as each repeated hit smashed against them, like an angry fist. After every few bangs, there was a rough scratching sound--as if a large German Shephard was on it's hind legs desperately trying to rip it's way in. I was terrified--initially. Then a confidence came over me; I thought my friend was trying to scare me. What was happening could definitely be recreated by a human. I rose off up of the couch--leaving Damien behind in the blanket (he was terrified) --and crept towards the banging, scratching double doors. By now it had been going on for about fifteen seconds. I was going to catch her in the act. As I approached the handles with both my hands, the banging and intermittent scratching continued. I quickly snatched the handles and yanked both the doors inward--but there was nothing. And silence. The hallway was empty. The lights were all off. What shreds of light that shone from behind me illuminated the entire hallway, but there was nothing there. The very moment that I had yanked those doors open, whatever it was had stopped. My stomach sunk... I didn't know what to do. I checked the rooms down the hall very carefully in fright, but no one was there. No one would have had the chance to escape me opening those doors and catching them in the act if someone else was in the house. I felt completely empty. 

I ran down the rest of the hall to where my friend was sleeping, and woke her up. She was sound asleep in her parents bed. That bedroom was maybe forty feet away down the hall. I jarred her awake and frantically told her what had happened; meanwhile I kept checking behind me towards the entrance to the hallway. She wasn't too surprised, and didn't have too much to say. Everything was quiet as I left her to go back to sleep, and somehow I managed to get back into the bonus room and fall asleep with my dog. In a way I was hoping that something else would happen to confirm what had happened, but nothing ever did. I woke up in the morning, said my goodbyes, and left. 

Over the years I would think about what happened occasionally, and I started doubting the events of that night. She moved away and I didn't have any contact with her for a long time. Years later I messaged her, asking if she remembered that night. She responded, recounting the night and how I had woken her up and had told her what had just happened. That chat I had with her confirmed once again everything that had transpired. 

I was sober that night in case you were wondering. I think about what had happened every week typically, and I hope that whoever is reading can assure themselves that my story is genuine. There was no explaining what had happened."
"The Uninvited Passenger","Florida","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","June 2020 brought with it my 73rd birthday, our 50th wedding anniversary, and very nearly my death. The bite of a Lone Star tick passed an infection into my bloodstream that was nearly fatal. Had treatment been delayed by a day I would have died, according to my doctor.

That experience confirmed that life is short and death can occur unexpectedly. I knew that, but still, it was a lesson learned. What troubled me most was passing on without sharing this life experience. ""Story"" does not apply here. What happened to me is being shared in this recounting. Make no mistake. This is about us, not just me. I am not a favored member of the human race, nor do I hold any special status. This could have been you, or it might be you one day in the future.

We are being watched. By who or what I do not know. Something certainly knew who I was and what I was doing at the time. I find that fairly easy to accept. Being watched supernaturally seems benign and is a common religious concept. Besides, what can we do about it? Of far greater concern is that something of a supernatural nature has the ability to appear in our physical world and interact, intercede or interfere in our respective lives. This is more difficult to accept or believe than simply being watched or observed. That is what I personally encountered and I have struggled with this memory for 50 years. It is a haunting of sorts, though not evil or demonic. You see, something almost indescribable presented itself to me in order to intercede in a critical decision that would impact the balance of my life. Had I not personally experienced what I am going to tell you, I would not believe it.

I was a soldier during the Vietnam War and assigned to a military installation in the eastern U.S. Circumstances required me to attend a week's training at another military post. While there I met a girl and we dated twice, as well as shared a few telephone calls. I returned to my unit, and after a few letters and phone calls we decided to marry. While odd, unusual things happen during wartime. I was an infantry soldier and my future was not assured. At 22, I thought I had nothing to lose by marrying. The war, on the other hand, was a more immediate concern.

It did not take long to arrange a return trip, perhaps a week or 10 days. We opted to drive to a Justice of the Peace to be wed. I drove her slightly less than mid-size American car, and in a few minutes we were on the interstate highway. There was a little nervous tension in the air as we undertook the trip. Then, about 10 minutes into the drive, it happened. An invisible entity appeared in the backseat of her car, directly behind me. It radiated an almost indescribable power through what seemed an invisible aura. I nearly blurted out ""There's something in the car with us!"" but managed to hold my tongue. My fear was appearing mad in front of the woman who would soon be my wife. Then, being somewhat psychic, I thought for an instant that this was a related experience. That thought left as quickly as it arrived. There was an entity in the back seat of the car and there was no denying it. Whatever it was, my soon to be wife had no idea something irregular was going on. This was happening to me alone.

There were no spoken words. Words were unnecessary at that point. It communicated with messages that appeared in my consciousness. They were complete conveyances. They arrived as whole ideas, not words that had to be assembled into an idea. Its communications resulted in immediate understanding. It was knowledge instantly gained and comprehended, though short and simple in presentation. Communication could be physical as well as mental. As soon as I grasped the idea that this was really happening, it pushed me forward toward the steering wheel rather abruptly. That was a confirming wake-up call.

I saw nothing of this being. Somehow I knew it to be about 8 feet tall. As I drove down the interstate I envisioned its head, neck and shoulders to be through and above the roof of the car. I do not know if that was communicated to me or not. I just seemed to know. I have no idea about its legs, assuming it had legs. I felt no sense of evil or dread, though it was non-physically oppressive to some degree. It was as though there was some sort of radiated pressure that served to confirm its presence. I felt the oppressive energy made this being unapproachable. A giant electro-magnet comes to mind, with its power of attraction reversed to instead repel. Yet, though very powerful, the repelling energy was initially gentle but firm. It was apparent that this being was not there to be my friend. It was, in fact, delivering a message. I do not know if the message was generated by this being, or if it had been sent to delivery a message created by someone else. It soon became apparent that it was interceding in my life in a surprising way. Its purpose was strictly business.

There was no time to be afraid. This was a real time ongoing encounter and I was instinctively responding to it. At the same time I was operating a motor vehicle on an interstate highway. A tiny part of me wondered what the woman riding with me was thinking. She was actually unaware of what was happening and, in fact, 50 years later still does not know this encounter took place.

DO NOT MARRY THIS WOMAN. That's what appeared in my mind. There were no words to quote. There was only knowledge and understanding, though reenforced by the somewhat oppressive energy I mentioned previously. Once started, the communications continued. They became more intense and more urgent, though not overwhelming. A father telling a child not to touch something hot comes to mind. Not all communications were identical as the phrasing sometimes differed, even though there were no words involved. No matter how the idea was passed, I was not to marry this woman. That understanding was amplified by unpleasant energy that was now becoming overbearing. If this being wanted my attention it was fully successful and I had nowhere to hide.

The entity's appearance, confrontation and interference were undermining my driving ability. I was slowing down in response to what was happening to me. Was this due to being distracted? Was my mind or body being influenced beyond my control? I do not know. In the distance a turn-around for emergency vehicles appeared. The communications, still in idea or knowledge form, changed to TURN AROUND AND TAKE HER BACK TO HER FAMILY. That came to me loud and clear with enhanced urgency. I am ashamed to say I almost did exactly that, and was involuntarily slowing to make the turn. The oppressive energy was taking a toll. All I seemed to be doing was responding to this being or entity.

I chose to stay my course. Not that I was deeply in love or a brave soul with steel in my spine. I was just afraid of returning her to her home and telling her family a ghost made me do it.

The emergency turn-around approaching, we came to the completely unexpected climax of the encounter. I had hands on the steering wheel and apparently the entity did as well. Now we struggled for control of the steering wheel as the entity tried to force me, or to physically encourage me, to turn her car around and take her back. How odd to write these words as I am absolutely certain I could have easily been overpowered by whatever this was.

The Scotch-Irish half of me surfaced and I blew-up in anger. I hate being bullied and that's what this experience felt like. Now it was my turn to communicate without spoken words. My sternly transmitted mental message was ""Leave me alone. I intend to marry this woman, and I am going to marry her, and that's it! Leave us alone.

It worked. Then it was gone. But the drive to the Justice of the Peace was unsettling. I kept wondering about the who, what and why of this experience. Now I had doubts about marrying this woman and, once again, I was too afraid to turn around and take her home as it would have hurt her emotionally. I felt like I going down a drain as things were getting out of control.

We wed. When I said ""I do."" it felt as though a 60 pound rucksack had been dropped on my back and I hunched over under the load.

That night I had a dream that showed me what I had done to myself and accurately foretold my future. The entity was trying to save me from myself. The horror was about to begin.

Who watches over us? Who intercedes in our lives? Fifty years have passed and I still do not know.

Thank you, Lord, for letting me get this off my chest."
"The Screaming Katrina Ghost","Louisiana","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","DISCLAIMER: At the risk of bragging, I should disclose that I tell scary stories for a living. While that might lead some to assume I'm making all of this up, if anything it should actually lend validity to the following claim. Because I make up stuff on a professional level and therefore have no desire to try and validate my fiction writing skills on a site meant to host true ghost stories. I promised I would share all of mine eventually though, and it's about time I actually try and do that... 

I was born and raised in New Orleans and Hurricane Katrina hit the summer after my senior year of high school. This story takes place two Christmas Eves later, outside the swanky Lakefront condo where I was currently living. And that was only because for a good while after Katrina, the whole city suffered from an epidemic of vacant luxury apartments.

Those brave few of us who had come back early enough that you could still smell the inside of everyone's refrigerator when you drove down the street were able to live pretty much wherever we wanted for insanely cheap. Before the lakefront condo, I had been paying $200 a month to rent a two-bedroom apartment on Magazine St. Which is currently going for EIGHT TIMES that. I only moved to the lakefront condo because it was CHEAPER, if you can believe it.

My mom was still living in Baton Rouge at this time and my younger sister had wanted to see the extended family for Christmas, so she was crashing with me that night. Even though she was in her late teens by this point, it had been a rough past few years and my mom wanted to surprise my sister with Christmas presents when she woke up in the morning.

Which is how I ended up spending most of that Christmas Eve night driving all the way to BR and back, my trunk now full of wrapped presents and my sister's dog May-May in the passenger seat, panting with anticipation. This was during the like two whole weeks of winter we get here each year and I remember it was cold enough that night that there was snow on the I-10. For a lifelong NOLA native, that sight alone was pretty surreal. 

I finally got back to the condo at about 3AM and had parked out front instead of inside the parking garage to make it easier to unload the car. I called my girlfriend to confirm that my sister was asleep and was waiting for her to come down and take May-May so I could safely sneak the presents up.

I wanted to save my girlfriend time and meet her at the entrance to the complex, so I clipped May-May's leash to her collar and we exited the car. We had just started toward the building when it happened.

Now, you need to understand that May-May is one of the sweetest dogs ever. Whenever she sees literally ANYBODY, her tail starts wagging because she knows there's at least an off-chance she might get attention. I had never heard May-May growl for real until that moment and it took me a second to realize it was even her making the noise.

My gaze was on the building's entrance when the growling started and I looked down just in time to see May-May stop dead in her tracks and then hunch down so low, her belly was almost touching the ground. She was looking at the vacant lot bordering the left side of the condo complex and I reflexively turned to follow her line of sight.

I saw a crying woman standing there, just beyond the corner of the building. She was in her 30s and had vaguely curly blond hair, barefoot and wearing only a white t-shirt that was long enough to resemble a night gown. The woman was sobbing and normally, if I were to see a half-naked woman sobbing in the middle of the night, I'd like to think my first reaction would be to try and help her.

But something about the sound of May-May's growl had sent a chill up my spine and when I spotted the woman, I froze in place as alarm-bells began to go off from what felt like the most primitive parts of my brain. And as soon as she saw me see her, we locked eyes and the woman let out the most blood-chilling scream I had ever heard.

If you've seen that recent RING camera footage of a car driving by someone's house with a possible female kidnapping victim in the passenger seat, this woman's scream sounded a lot like that. She pointed out at the lake in front of her/behind me as the scream seemed to go on forever. Even longer than you'd think someone could scream.

And then she was gone. The woman didn't fade away. It wasn't even like I blinked and she had vanished. She was simply there and then she wasn't, her scream cut-off just as suddenly but the sound of it still ringing in my ears.

About a week later, one of the maintenance men told me that before Katrina, a homeless couple with two kids used to live out of an old shed that had been abandoned on that vacant field between the complex and the neighboring building. Of course, they hadn't been seen since the hurricane and like many of the city's homeless, were presumed dead.

And of course my description of the screaming woman matched the mother of this homeless family exactly, down to her slightly curly blond hair and the long t-shirt she wore like a dress. Which led me to conclude that she hadn't been pointing at the lake. She had been pointing at the floodwaters."
"My Path Has Begun","Oklahoma","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","Dear YGS family,

I have had quite a few new experiences within this house. 

I've grown quite a bit spiritually. I've opened up to new experiences and have found my calling. 

I have set up 2 different altars. One for my workings, the other for my ancestors. Both have grown significantly as I've learned and continue to learn about my path. 

I've met so many new people, and have become great close friends with a few that I never thought I would have. My life has changed and again will soon. 

Which leads me to the experiences. I have caught a voice on a video of mine recording from my cellular device. I was recording a video of a ritual I was conducting. Throughout the entire process I felt a presence with me. Watching and guiding me. I always record my rituals and then write down certain things about them. For whatever reason still unknown to me I said "" well hello"" and within about 4 seconds later a long drawn out ""Hiiiiii"" came through. 

I didn't know I had caught that voice at the time. Because I was patiently watching over my candles etc as they burned and had put my phone on the charger. 

The next morning while taking in the fresh breeze and warm morning sun from the front porch I had remembered that I had recorded and was wanting to do a bit of playback on what I had done.Didn't think or know I had captured a voice on it.

I started to play the video, turned the volume all the way up and listened. 

I heard myself and then got the shock of the rest of the week and excitement! I caught something replying back to me.

Just to be clear, I make sure I have protection in place at all times. Wards amulets circles etc. 

The next day while I doing some research on some things, I decided because I was in a meditative state I would record on my phone again. The phone was placed on the bed behind me and I was reading at the time. I eventually finished and turned the video off. 

The room was completely quiet, the only thing you could hear on the audio was of me turning a page and a voice that sounded like mine chanting something in a language very lightly for the first four seconds of the video. It suddenly stops and then it's the page turning from the book.

Other times while I'm sleeping in the bed I will wake up to hear something going on around my workings altar. I'm not exactly sure what's going on. I've heard shuffling around my bed, nothing new there. And have found one of my crystals on the floor off of my altar. 

It's hard for any of my kids to be in the room too long, I've made a sacred space in there, as that's truly the only space in the house I can be left alone to do anything. 

I have always been in tune with spirits, whether it was noticing the energy they have, seeing them around or hearing them. But it's as though the volume has turned up and it's getting interesting. I have learned so much within the past couple of years. And am on a continuous learning journey. I can't seem to find the words to explain how I feel now that I have accepted my path. I feel grounded, more leveled, happy. 

I know this wasn't exactly exciting or scary. But I was excited to tell you all about this. My journey has begun.

Thank you for reading

"Can Spirit Answer Through My Vocal Cords?","New York","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","2020 has been a very hard year for the world and I have been more in tune with my religious side than before. I'm probably not alone in that there are nights when I just can't sleep, bothered by the uncertainty of it all and how alone quarantine has made me feel. I work a job that has gone completely remote, so here I am living right in the city, yet having very little contact with the outside world. It's been hard for me in general and the isolation can be all consuming, not knowing when this will all be resolved. Some nights I need answers and find my patience wearing thin.

Occasionally when I have a hard time sleeping I will pray and ask for answers about life's biggest questions. Things like the state of the world, the state of humanity, and why I am treated the way I am by society.

And occasionally, I will get an answer. Sometimes it comes to me as a thought hitting me in the head like a lightning bolt, something I had never thought of my own or would think to say. It's almost like someone else is responding to me. 

And other times, I'll find myself whispering these thoughts out of nowhere, phrases that may be answers to the questions I ask. The voice that comes out is my own, but the speech is something that's like a reply. I just can't explain it so I'll leave it up to you guys. 

Has anyone ever had an experience where your questions are answered by an entity, but in your own voice and coming out of your own vocal cords? Who or what could possibly be communicating to me in this manner?"
"The Face In The Old Shed Window","Texas","Haunted Places","My great maternal grandparents owned a 16 acre farmstead that they'd purchased back during the late 1920's to early 1930's. You reached it via old country road and the house and property itself was located smack dab in the center of a forested area.

My great maternal grandmother passed away in '99 and her husband, my great maternal grandfather, in 2011. This story takes place about a year after his passing.

The property consisted of the main house, a huge hay field and garden, tons of trails and a beautiful lake. To get to mentioned lake you had to trek down a sloped rocky trail past an old wooden shed.

The shed sat right next to the built in carport so whenever you were outside in the front yard of the house it was always visible.

I was 17 at the time so I was at the age where the paranormal didn't exactly frighten me, but this experience was definitely enough to give me more than a bit of a spook as I was more of a skeptic back then than I am now. I honestly wouldn't even consider myself one at this point.

It was late in the evening, roughly about 6:30-ish, still enough daylight to see, so I'd been out walking around and debating on whether or not I'd wanted to make the trip all the way down to the lake. Every one else was inside so in the end I decided to go ahead out of boredom.

Now every time I went down to that lake, that old shed had always caught my attention. It was small, just a simple tool shed that had housed more pool floats than tools, but just looking at it, it always seemed to give off a creepy vibe. Old, dirty and tattered sheets made up the drapes that lined the inside of the sheds only two windows, one of which was located on the door. One of the sheets on the side of the shed had been ripped in three places to where it resembled a screaming ghoul face. Definitely never helped with it's oh so ""cheery"" appearance.

So as I was walking, I, like I did every time, glanced over towards the shed, directly to the door that was padlocked closed. As I mentioned above I was a pretty big skeptic then, but I swear to you that when I looked at that door, I was instantly rooted to the spot and my blood ran cold. It was late January so it was already chilly outside but the air around me had suddenly felt too cold, even with my layers of coats. It had taken everything in me not to yell out. 

What I saw in that window, resembled a humanoid face but with black eyes that seemed to pierce directly through me. When I think back on it, it didn't look like my great grandmother or anyone else I'd recognized, but I was close enough to determine that it had in fact had a feminine facial structure. The bottom corner of the sheet covering the window on the door was ripped off so this thing was watching me through the hole.

I don't know how long I stood there, it was only at hearing the sound of a tree branch snapping behind me did I move to turn and make a break back to the house. I never once looked back to see if it was still there I just ran.

I remember staying inside for the rest of the night after that. Not wanting to be anywhere out there near whatever the hell that had been. I'd told my family that night, but, with us being of the Christian religion they didn't believe in ghosts and hauntings so they simply wrote it off as it being too dark out coupled with my wild teenage imagination. There had never been any previous deaths on the property that we knew of up until my great grandmother, but she hadn't even died on the property itself. And like I said it hadn't even looked like her.

I knew what I saw though. And the fact that that door was LOCKED from the outside meant that NO ONE had gotten in to pull a prank on me. This was when my skepticism began to die. 

From that day on I'd named it simply ""the face in the shed"" (super original right?) and I'd been all the more wary whenever I'd passed by that building. But I never saw it again. My family doesn't own the property anymore unfortunately so now I can't ever go back to try and see if whatever I'd seen is still lingering around. And the new owners haven't said anything so either they haven't seen ""her"" or just prefer not to tell..."
"Dollar Shop Ghost Pt. 2","Texas","Haunted Places","It's been awhile since the first part of this story and to start off I can say that I'm still working at the same store although occurrences have slowed down quite considerably during the last few years.

A lot of stuff has happened since the first part. A lot of employees have come and gone and more recently a lady who I loved working with there and who had been there since the store opened sadly passed away.

Among the new faces we've gotten is one older woman who is as sweet as can be. Unfortunately whatever has been in the store has not left just merely gone silent and it has chosen to now make itself known to her.

When the lady who I will name Ms. K, first began working I let her know that the store had a ghost, she kind of laughed but enjoyed me telling her the stories of happenings over the last three years.

I've been promoted to mod since the first part so whenever I work with Ms. K she has my old job and does the cleaning at night while I work on the nightly closing duties.

It didn't take her long to figure out something or someone is in the store after hours with us. She's heard voices, the sound of items falling off the shelf and yet when we walk the isles nothing is ever on the floor. 

Up at the registers we have our impulse candy and item rack. It has stuff on each side and for a time Ms. K had a cast on her foot so she had to sit often. One night as she was in a chair on one side of the impulse rack she yelled out as I was walking back up to the front of the store to her. When I got up I asked her what was wrong and she just looked at me with wide eyes and said ""I swear to you I just heard something fall right behind me."" 

So I looked on the other side of the rack, expecting something to be on the floor, but there was nothing. And I checked both sides thinking maybe she'd accidentally knocked something off with the chair but no. There was absolutely nothing on the floor and she is not the type of person to make something up.

She said it gave her instant chills and I believe her. 100%. She's heard stuff other times before and it's gotten to the point where she comes back up to the front saying she doesn't want to go back there again.

I myself have had a few odd things happen within the last couple of months. The lady who passed away who I will call Ms. R, was amazing to work with and I miss her a lot. I could tell you at times that, since her death, while in the store I hear someone talking when no one is near and it sounds so much like her. But that's hard to say if it is her or just my memory of her voice messing with my head. She'd worked at that store for 10+ years of her life though so I wouldn't be surprised if it was her. It makes me feel less sad in a way.

One last odd encounter that's happened recently was late one night, since we've been having some issues with our stores and robberies lately we have to hide some stuff in the store every night. I have a spot already selected that I use all the time but I don't pull anything out until I'm ready to go. About 10 minutes before closing there had been no one in the store aside from myself and my coworker for the night. I walked by where I hide the stuff and it was all neat and still in place. 10 minutes later and we close like normal, my coworker goes to start cleaning in the back and I do my closing duties. I can see the spot where I hide the stuff from where I'm at in the office and everything is still neat. 

I don't shut the door but I'm not paying attention to the spot and so I didn't see what actually happened but when I was finished in the office I walked out ready to hide the stuff away only to stop in my tracks because right where I'm about to put the stuff up everything that I would have had to pull out is already out and laid on the floor like I do it every night. I didn't do it, and when I asked my coworker about it she swore she didn't do it either. She had no reason to. I honestly don't know what to say about it other than whoever or whatever did it helped I suppose, but I'll leave it up to the reader to decide."
"The Walker Ames House","Washington","Ghost Hunting","I've been a paranormal investigator since 2005. I started this because I've always been fascinated by the paranormal not because I had any experiences (that I can remember) as a child. So I was a bit skeptical of most people claiming to have ghostly encounters, although I do have a very open mind.

 When I first started out I took some classes on learning what to do, at the end of the series of classes, our instructor, a man named Neil McNeill took us to an amazing town called Port Gamble, WA. The last day of the class we got to investigate an abandoned mansion called the Walker Ames house. This house is beautiful but it hasn't been lived in for decades now. The town keeps it up as much as they can for special events, etc. But it isn't up to code to have anyone live in it permanently. 

 Neil told us the history of the house and the ghost stories, in my mind, I was thinking this was just going to be a fun night exploring an old historic lumber mill home, I didn't think it would change my life forever.

As I said, I'm a skeptic. My mind cannot easily be changed or fooled by people, I have to see things for myself. There were 6 of us in the house that night. Neil split us up into two groups. One group went down to the basement and we stayed on the second floor. He had just warned us to stay out of this little hallway by the attic door, it was between the bathroom and the landing, because he was feeling a strong presence there of something. In my mind I just thought, 'surrrreee you did' (sarcastically) and walked to a far bedroom.

 I heard him in another room answering questions of the other investigator, but when I came out, I saw his shadow in the hallway (the little hallway he just told us NOT to stand in). As I started to walk over there to see what he was doing, the shadow quickly came toward me and disappeared. I started for a second and was stunned. I still heard Neil and the other person talking but the shadow was GONE. I couldn't process it. I went around the corner and saw them talking in a little room right around the corner of the bathroom. I interrupted them, ""WHO, WAS JUST STANDING IN THE HALLWAY?"" I said WAY to loudly. 

Neil looked at me for a second and said, ""UM, June, no one was standing in the hallway."" I said, ""NOooooooo, someone was standing in the hallway, I saw their shadow and it's gone now."" He looked at me and smiled and asked what the shadow looked like. I saw a dark, black shadow, looked a little short, thick middle and bald or round head. It was still light outside but the sun was setting, all of the shadows were elongated, this one was standing straight up and down.

 I even went downstairs, outside and found a leaf and tore it in the shape of a person and put it up at the stained glass window, just in case it was natural. Nope, definitely not that. 

I was at a loss for words. When finally I had NO explanation for it, Neil told me that (unbeknownst to me) several people had seen shadows of people upstairs and several people reported seeing the shadow of a short, fat, bald man. I wasn't the only one. 

At that moment while he was telling me this, we heard a yelp from the stairway. Another person coming up the stairway said she swore she just saw the shadow of a person running across the landing and it disappeared. 

After that night, I realized I was hooked forever being a ""ghost hunter"" and now I'm Vice President of one of the oldest ghost hunting teams of the Pacific Northwest, The Advanced Ghost Hunters of Seattle Tacoma (A.G.H.O.S.T.)."
"To The Little Girl At Bonnie Springs, I'm Sorry","Nevada","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","TRIGGER WARNING: Violent child death.

This - is probably the most disturbing story I've ever shared in my entire life.

I don't know where to begin so I'll just start at the beginning. Bonnie Springs operated here in Vegas until early this year. And it was notoriously haunted. The past two years, a friend and I decided to attend its Halloween event ""Bonnie Screams"" and had a blast.

Now I probably am somewhat of a medium - because what I experienced there proved there is more to me than just ""seeing spirits"".

It happened over both years. And started when we went to what was considered the most haunted place on property: the old playhouse. A magician was doing a magic show and the first thing I noticed upon entering was a small girl, maybe 7 with pigtails standing on the stage. I didn't think anything of it at the time - even if she quickly seemed to go backstage.

Now during the show, there were several papers set up on the wall, and one and ONLY one was flapping in an invisible wind. While I enjoyed the show I spent much of the time noticing this - and finally understood why when he got to his ""ghost trick"".

He spoke of the little girl who supposedly haunted the building we were in.

She was murdered we were told. And when he tried to communicate using a bell and rope, and asked where she was... Well I told him she was on stage. He didn't have to ask. Instead the bell rang in the affirmative upon my accusation.

I went pale. But the rest of the show proceeded as normal. Though I thought of the girl the rest of the night and was thoroughly disturbed.

The next year, is when things turned spooky.

Again, she was there when I got inside. But this year, as the magician comes out I remind him of me and my story. And tell him she was still there - on stage right now. The magician I think thought I was playing a joke - but decided to make a ""game"" of it when the ghost trick again came up.

Big mistake.

For the first several minutes, it was a dud. So he decided to get me into it just out of pure curiosity. He asked if she was near me, and did not get an answer. And then, cautiously stepped up behind the woman currently holding the rope the bell was attached to and asked if she was there, on stage.

The bell rang for a straight minute.

Then the banging started. It was loud and angry. And came from every wall in the room. There was mild panic from the audience and my blood ran cold. After another minute of this; it stopped. And the terrified magician continued his act as quickly as possible. He probably just wanted me the hell out of there I gathered.

That night, for the first time in my entire life I believe a spirit attempted to make contact with me.

I went to sleep - but I didn't dream. Not the typical dream at least. In the dream, I was in the old west (NOTE: Bonnie Springs is a ranch) and I was being violently yanked along by a man in the shadows. Except I wasn't me, I was the murdered little girl. I fought, and I screamed; and I begged for my life. Completely helpless as he dragged me, yards past the old schoolhouse on the property.

That's when I saw the Axe. It was awful. Words can't describe the horror of watching this man, who I never could get a good look at, tearing into the little body with an axe. Over an over. Until the cries stopped - and he kept going. It seemed like an eternity before the man started digging what I assume was her shallow grave...

I woke up in a deep sweat, completely startled and knowing exactly where that poor girl died. Where she was buried. Everything.

As I said, this year Bonnie Springs was torn down to make room for more homes. It makes me sad that given so long has passed since her murder, I can't help her. I can't go back there to help her find whatever peace she wants and there's likely no remains to be found anymore.

A part of me hopes she only wanted someone, anyone to know what happened to her. That maybe she found peace in knowing she was able to get that message to me. Maybe she's in heaven now.

But it makes me horribly sad to believe that she may still be there. And continue to walk this Earth in these new homes. 

To the little girl at Bonnie Springs Ranch, I'm sorry I couldn't help you. I'm sorry you had such a violent death. And I hope someday, somehow you find the peace you seek."
"The White Lady Of Burger King","Nevada","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","It's been a while.

For a while things had calmed down in my life with the supernatural, but as of the last couple of years all kinds of bizarre events are happening. I thought some would make great stories to share with you, but I'm starting with an ongoing saga of what we have dubbed ""The White Lady"" at my Burger King.

I've worked for the company a year now, and both locations I have been at were haunted. While there's not much story to the first store I was at, what I've experienced on the night shift, along with others, at my current store? Is something straight from a horror movie.

It started simple enough. One night, while I was manning the front counter I noticed a young woman in her twenties waving to get my attention. She had what I'd best describe as a formal white gown on from the flapper days and long blonde hair. I explained I'd be right with her, and turned away less than a second. In the time I'd taken to turn back around - she was gone.

I assumed I was just exhausted, and wrote it off until a month later. My co workers and I were discussing ghosts, and while asking if a friend believed in them she mentioned she'd seen one at work. When I asked the story - I'll give you one guess as to the specter she described. That's right, the same lady, the same wave, even standing in the same place.

It really creeped us out - but we didn't think much of it. But apparently, the woman knew we'd seen her because that's when the haunting began in earnest.

It started as little things. To this day, I see her in the lobby doing various things. Whether it be waving me down again, sitting in a booth staring out the window, or dancing as if she's at the most elegant one person ball I had seen. Other people claimed to see her too, including one employee who I'd never seen so spooked in my life.

Overall, however, she seemed to keep to herself so we let her be. About a month after her frequent appearances, however, things started to become less ""Casper"" and more ""Poltergeist"".

One night, after I had clocked out and went home. One of my employees was waiting for a ride and swore to me as she was walking around, something followed her. Loud, heavy footsteps, that she said made her blood run cold. I found this a little eerie but thought nothing of it even after she quit no longer wishing to work the night shift.

Then came my disturbing experience. At about 11:55 only 5 minutes until closing, I was taking orders. I had told the current car that I didn't have a specific item they wanted. What I was greeted by was THE most blood-curdling scream I have ever heard in my life. Like the sound of a woman in a horror movie just moments before being taken out by some man in a mask.

I threw off my headset. Thinking it was just someone in the car. And as the car, who didn't want the food, drove off. I noticed distinctly that there was only one passenger in the car... A man. Understandably I was visibly shaken and thanked god that I never got another car before I was able to take it off for the night.

After that, her appearances became far more frequent. My GM was skeptical but becoming less so with every team member that seemed to come forward having heard a strange sound, or seemingly seen someone who just wasn't there.

Fast-forward to last night. We had already closed the dinning room for the night and I was cleaning when clear as day - I heard her for the first time. ""Excuse me, sir?"" Came a woman's loud voice. I turned around - but though there were two women there both were on their phones and finishing their meals. Neither had any idea what I was talking.

Then tonight, came what I call the escalation. I came into work to my GM telling me ""Ok I think I believe you about your ghost."" I asked what happened. And according to her, both managers this morning, while the store was completely empty swore up and down that they heard someone shout the ASM's name. After a thorough search, they found absolutely no one in the store. Which apparently spooked her out. She had previously written it off having worked the night shift and not seen a thing.

Then tonight, as we were doing our usual work. My co worker turned to me and asked if I could hear someone crying. At first I was too busy to notice, but before long, I heard gross sobbing - again; a woman's. I stood there dumbstruck, and asked another co worker who heard the same thing. Our only female co worker there was standing right beside me straight faced and handing out food in the drive thru.

It continued for a good five minutes.

Supposedly, our Burger King is built near what was once an old cemetery if my older co worker is to be believed. But honestly, none of us know where to begin to figure out who the white lady is. And most are too afraid of finding out to call up a paranormal team. I only hope she is as friendly as she first appeared and her creepier interactions are indeed harmless.

I'll be sure to update with a Part II or more if and when things continue to get strange."
"My Little Bighorn Battlefield Experience","Montana","Haunted Places","I visited Montana for the first time in June of 2004. I would later move there from my home state of CT and live in both Eastern and Western parts of the state for 9 years.

 My friend picked me up from the Billings airport and suggested that we see the battlefield. He was a bit of a history buff. When we arrived, we were driving along the road past the visitors' center. I got very quiet, suddenly feeling very heavy and serious. We got to a point in the road that looked down some rolling prairie and we decided to get out and walk. My friend, a Montana native, didn't seem to be disturbed very much, but as I looked down into the coulees and saw the white stone markers bunched together closely, I became overwhelmed with terror and a deep sadness. I knew that the people who died in that area had been trying to hide and were unable to defend themselves. I could almost see it. I tried telling this to my friend and he seemed perplexed. I started to cry and couldn't stop. It alarmed my friend and he decided we should leave. We left the park and pulled over for a few minutes and I started to calm down. I couldn't explain my experience to someone that had never felt those things and it was a little embarrassing.

 It is not the first time and I'm sure it won't be the last that I encounter an intense residual like that. A word of advice to any empaths or sensitives visiting the battlefield: ground yourself well before entering or prepare to be overwhelmed with the emotions of those unfortunate souls, both native American and non.

I am interested to read any similar stories that you have. Please share!"
"My Parents Don't Believe Me When I Say This Place Is Haunted","Kansas","Haunted Places","About 6 years ago my family moved into this house. At that time, nothing bad happened. No paranormal stuff, nothing out of the ordinary. So I'll skip to the part all the fun (somewhat scary) stuff happened. Around 4 years ago, I kept loosing my (small) stuffed animals, and small collectables stored on my dresser. My family members were reporting losing stuff as well, such as watches, jewelry, legos, and other things. We didn't know where it all went for a few weeks. Until Mom told me and my sister to clean our room. I decided to clean underneath my bed (because I was sure there was only some dust, maybe a few toys) when I noticed that all mine and the rest of my family members stuff lying there. I thought nothing of it, and told my sister, who told our brother (I think it was only one of them), who told our parents. We all took what was ours, and blamed me for taking it. I told them I never recalled taking them, but I was willing to take the blame. I believe that I (or someone else) had just walked around and took the stuff, or took them to frame me.

 But anyways, fast forward another 2 years and me, my mother, and my sister were hanging out in mine (and my sisters) room. Our cat was acting weird, and seemed on edge. We thought it was pretty funny, and thought of it as normal behavior considering she had never been in our room before. I took out my phone and filmed the entire thing. I only stopped filming when our cat left. I replayed the video with the sound on and heard something odd. A voice that belonged to a male. At the time I was filming, my brothers were downstairs and my father was at a store. My brothers were playing a board game, and denied ever coming up there in the last hour or so. I went back into my room and listened through the audio a couple times to figure out what the male voice said. ""Are you?"" Is what it said for those who are curious. I showed the film to my mother, who said I had edited it. I denied doing that, and had her listen to all the audio effects I had in the single editing app I had at the time.

 She still didn't believe me, so I went back into my room and recorded myself asking a bunch of questions, waiting for a response. I listened to the audio and... Nothing. I showed my father the first video when he got back home, but not even he believed me. My siblings did though, since they can tell when I am lying and when I'm not. Ever since that day I have been waiting for something else to happen. Something to prove that I didn't fake the video."
"The Victorian Home Part 4","Ohio","Haunted Places","I'm back once again with another story in my house, this time it's a much more creepy story, and I'm pretty concerned just thinking about it. 

Last night, me and my parents decided to have a bonfire in our yard. We were all just having fun as a family! My mom was taking pictures of me and my dad. She wanted to try something fun with her phone, so she decided to put it on a video and make it slow motion. She videoed my dad saying something funny and laughing, and then put it on slow motion.

 As we were watching him in slow motion on the video, suddenly, we heard loud, almost gruff, heavy breathing. It sounded almost like a large man was standing right on my mom as she was videoing. At first, it was one loud breath, and then slower breaths after that. A persons breathing is so distinct, so I think that's what was so creepy about it. If you have ever used slow mode on an iPhone, you would know that obviously, everything moves in slow motion, as well as breathing or any other noise. But this wasn't. You could barely even hear my dad talking and laughing on the video, since it was in slow motion, yet you could hear this breathing so loudly. All of us were a bit alarmed by the video.

 My mom decided to try to recreate another video like it, and see if she caught anything else on the slow motion video. She began videoing me laughing, and smiling while by the bonfire. She played the video in slow motion, that's when we heard it. Music on the slow motion video. But we didn't have any music playing, and we couldn't hear it to the naked ear. It sounded like someone was hitting loud notes on a piano. It just kept going BING. BING. BING. Really slowly. Possibly sounded maybe even like someone slowly winding up an old music box of some sort, but to all of us, we thought piano keys. Then, it sounded like a loud, screeching note at the end. Then it got even weirder. A loud growling noise came after the music, it sounded as if a large animal was about to attack. It didn't sound ''nice'' at all, and it definitely didn't sound human-like. They were just weird, disturbing noises, as if something was just really angry. Like a huge animal was making a gruff, growling sound. The video ends after that.

 I was pretty shaken up after listening to the video, and couldn't even believe that I heard what I did. I looked at my mom hoping she would give me a logical explanation like she always does, just to make myself feel better. But she looked like she was in shock and fear, just as I was. Then she looked at my dad and said ''Um honey, what could that be?''. My dad is never scared of anything, and basically just laughs and teases if you find something you think is creepy, but my mom let him listen to the video again. He got a concerned look on his face, and said ''What the hell is that?'' That's the same thing I'm ''Still'' wondering.

 My mom then said, ok, that's it! I need to know what that was. So she told me to video her in Slow mode. I took a short video of her smiling in slow motion, then we heard something completely different on her video. On hers, loud gunshots. It just sounded like BOOM BOOM BOOM, and then an even louder gunshot at the end. We were concerned on that video to, but we all agreed that the creepy music and growling on the slow motion video of me was the most concerning. 

It seemed like every time we put the videos on in slow motion, we were hearing noises that were happening somewhere else, and not where we were at the time. But I knew that the noise just had to be happening at that moment, which made no sense. We had no music, no gun and there definitely wasn't anything making the sort of growling we heard, and we were only hearing these noises in slow motion.

All of us still concerned about what exactly was in the videos, my mom got up and said we should go use slow mode in the house and see if it does anything. So we kept all of the lights off, and turned on the slow mode, and began recording each room in our house. My mom headed into the Living Room first, which is where she saw the little girl running away. She then ended the video, and we all huddled around the video, watching it in slow motion to see if we saw or heard anything at all. Then, my mom pointed at the video and said ''There!'' She rewinded the video, ad we all saw an orb shooting rapidly past. But how exactly? The video was in slow motion. Nothing could have been moving that fast. Then, we even saw 2 more orbs after that, moving the exact same speed. 

We used the slow mode video everywhere else in the house as well, but that was the only room that we saw anything in.

I don't think that any of these occurrences should be brushed off, because it feels to me like a sort of demonic entity since listening to these rather disturbing videos. 

My grandpa passed away from a lung disease September 1st. My mom said she has been trying to communicate with him, and has been talking with him. Before we began taking the slow motion videos around the bonfire, we had been talking about an incident that had happened to my mom. She received a Facebook message saying that my grandpa wanted to be tagged in a picture of him, which was posted in memory of him. But obviously, he had already passed away 6 days before this happened. So how was he asking to be tagged in a picture? My mom was even in tears after this happened. She saw it as a sign that he was trying to tell her that he was still there. 

But since we had been talking about this incident before taking the videos, what if something else is just trying to toy with us into making us think it was him? When we heard the video where there was music and growling, we all knew that it wasn't my grandpa, because he would never sound like that.

I don't believe that you can welcome something else into your house, just by trying to communicate with a deceased loved one, but I really don't know much about how that works. But after the disturbing videos, my mom said that she was going to have to stop trying to talk with my grandpa, as sad as it was, because she didn't want to stir anything paranormal up, anymore than she possibly already had.

My mom kept all of the videos on her phone, and I have listened to them all at least a dozen times, but still can't debunk anything. I feel that I should be concerned, and look forward to hearing more opinions."
"Just A Regular Dog Walk","Iowa","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I recently discovered this site over the summer when I was off work. It has intrigued me to the point where I have spent several nights that have turned into early mornings reading people's experiences!

Two days ago I was walking my Boxer, Gigi, when a gentleman was approaching us from the other direction. The man wore a yellow and black button down shirt, untucked, with jeans. I said hello and smiled as he got closer but he stared straight ahead and didn't acknowledge me.

My dog and I were walking down a fairly busy street, and it was around 12:15pm. The next crosswalk was a ways up, and there is High School across the street. I turned around a few seconds later and the man was gone. He wasn't walking any faster than we were, so I don't think he could have made it out of my eye sight in that little amount of time.

My dog is very friendly, and approaches everyone. I didn't think of it at the time, but she didn't go near the man. 

I shared this story with some others and they thought it may be a Residual Haunting due to the fact that the man didn't seem to notice me and stared straight ahead. Some had suggested I try to walk that path at the exact same time to see if I pass the man again.

I didn't feel anything strange near the person, just more confused where he could have walked to so quickly in that short amount of time. The street we were walking on was busy; I don't think he would've crossed without being at the crosswalk.

The only other thing I have experienced was something more spiritual as an eight year old, and I often hear my name said. I live alone. 

Thoughts?"
"Dark Shadow In The Hall And Cat's Reaction","South Carolina","Pets / Animals","We've only had my cat, Luna, for about six months now ever since we found her as a kitten in the backyard. Due to the general erratic cat behavior and the adolescent need to act the fool it's difficult to tell if she notices anything out of the ordinary around the house. That is until this morning. 

Since I work nights and sleep most of the day we really don't have much time for bonding, so that time is usually in the early mornings right after work between 7:30 and 10 when we participate in our ritual belly rubbing/hand mauling. It was around 8:30 and not quite light out we were in the middle of our ritual while sitting in my computer chair when out of the corner of my eye I saw a brief glimpse of a dark shadow go past my door and down the hall. At the same time Luna looked up and started staring in that direction. She was staring so long that I set her on the floor where she ran out into the hall and stood there looking up and down the hallway for about a minute before coming back into the room and jumping back in my lap. 

I know it wasn't my parents because my mom is short while the shadow was tall and even though my dad is taller than me this shadow seemed to be floor to ceiling tall. Part of me thought it was passing car lights causing the shadows move or something, but that doesn't really explain Luna's reaction because she wasn't looking when it passed by because her eyes were closed, but she still looked up in that direction at the exact same time I saw the movement, almost like she heard it go by. Another odd thing was when she came back to my lap since usually when her attention to something is broken she goes off to find something else to do, but this time she came right back.

I know this isn't all that exciting, but I just wanted to know what y'all think."
"Patio Door Locked And Lights Turned On","Wisconsin","Haunted Places","On a late summer Sunday afternoon I was dog sitting my daughter and son-in-laws 5 month old puppy so they could have dinner out with friends. We were initially sitting out on the front porch; however decided to move to the back deck. I locked the front door as we came in and removed the dogs leash. Since it was quite warm out, I closed the storm door as the air conditioner was on.

 After we had been on the deck for a few minutes I decided to go inside to turn on the dishwasher. I couldn't open the door. Initially, I thought that I was just not pulling hard enough, etc.; however that was not the case.

 I could see that the lock lever was in the up position. After about 30 minutes trying to decide what to do, I went around to the front door just to see if maybe I just thought I locked the front door; it was locked. I go back to the deck and wait another 20 minutes or so to send a text to my daughter letting her know that we were ok, but locked out. She responded about 45 minutes later as her phone had been in her purse. She indicated that they would be on their way in a few minutes.

 The dog started running around the deck (I call them zoomies) which he does from time to time, but this time, it lasted for a while. I remember thinking as it was getting dark, that my daughter would come home to a dark house (no lights on inside or out). That's about the time that the dog stopped running around and kept looking inside.

 The lights are now on. This detail I did not remember until the next day, or otherwise I would have been frightened. When my daughter came home, she confirmed that the door was clearly locked. One has to put a little pressure on it to lock. We tried to re-create by going outside, pulling the door shut; and it never locked.

The house is new so I did speak to the building supervisor the next day. He said its impossible to lock the door from the outside; however he came over immediately and tried to recreate the lock from the outside and couldn't. Thank you for reading. Any insight would be appreciated."
"The Nun Chased Me Away","New Jersey","Ouija Board / Seances","Hey everyone. I would like to state that after reading other posts from folks on this site that I will NEVER AGAIN try to use a Ouija board ever again. I'm still curious about them but, as goofy as I can be, I won't push my luck on them:) 

My girlfriend (now wife) started college back in 2001. She dormed with her sister for a year. Her 2 best friends also ended up going to the same college so we would hang out a lot after her classes were over. Me, having been kicked out of school for terrible grades, would spend all my free time up there when I wasn't working. 

Her dorm building had a commons area on the 2nd and 3rd floor, and each area had various board games. Her floor just happened to have a Ouija board as well. We, showing all the grace and intelligence of 18 & 19 year olds, decided to break it out and use it. I was excited as I had never used one before, but my girlfriend had. 

Now before the fun part, it's worth pointing out that this was a Catholic college and her dorm building also served as a Catholic high school. Nuns still live on site and there is also a small cemetery next to the dorm where a few nuns were laid to rest. 

I don't remember who started asking questions, but we eventually got a response from someone claiming to be a nun. I can't remember this sister's name to save my life, forgive me as it's been almost 20 years. We started asking her questions, who she was, how she passed (the pointer started swinging back and forth for that question which really freaked us out), and if she was mad about something. Well it turns out that she was mad that I was there. We asked why she was mad and she spelled out my first name. This really freaked out my girlfriend. We then asked if she wanted me to leave and she replied with Yes. My girlfriend hugged me almost in tears so we ended the session and I soon after left the campus. 

Now there are various ways one can take essentially being chased out by a ghost from a college dorm. I myself find the best possible solution is to drive back to your home town (45 minutes for me at that time), go to the local ice cream hot spot (Magic Fountain in Elizabeth) and then order/devour a banana split all by yourself. 

Maybe this story is more about how I got ice cream instead of the Ouija board, but I still won't touch one ever again. Unless ice cream is guaranteed at the end. Side note - my girlfriend now wife just celebrated 13 years of wonderful marriage together, so take that Nun who chased me away!:D"
"Ghosts Making Themselves Known","New York","Haunted Places","After I graduated college, my friends and I were a bit tapped out (we had little money) but we lived in Buffalo where there were many very old apartments that rented rather cheaply. A friend and his new wife were looking for someplace to live and I accompanied them to look at an apartment they were considering renting. I don't recall much of what the apartment looked like but I remember going into the living room and having to leave right away. I felt something unnatural in there. I was sure that the apartment was haunted. I never said anything to my friends because I thought they would think I was nuts and I didn't want to put a negative spin on a place that they had settled on as their next place of residency. After they moved in, we were at a mutual friend's house and they jokingly said ""I think our apartment is haunted"". This piqued my attention. They proceeded to tell of weird things that happened - such as one night when they were sleeping, they woke up because the bedroom light just turned itself on. (That's the one I remember but they told about other things.) I knew that the apartment was haunted and then told them so. 

When living in Buffalo, I moved into a very nice 3 bedroom apartment in the North End. As I was unpacking I heard something crash in a cupboard in the bathroom. I looked to see what had shifted or fallen only to find that there were only towels in the cupboard and they were sitting as I had put them in there, neatly folded and undisturbed - and the noise I heard could not have come from towels! The landlord and his wife lived downstairs (it was a two family house) and next that I saw them I jokingly I said ""I didn't know I'd be sharing the apartment with a ghost."" I expected them to laugh or ask ""what do you mean?"" but instead they looked at each other rather strangely then said ""oh, he's up there now?"" I asked what they meant and they told me that they had experienced strange happenings themselves. They told me of a time when, having a pool table in the basement and a rack with the pool sticks on it, all the pool sticks simultaneously fell off the rack at one time. There were other stories as well. 

I remember that there was a coat closet in the living room (where my TV was located). Any time I would leave the room and come back in, the closet door was opened. I made sure when I closed it that it would ""click"" so that I would be assured that it was indeed closed yet every time I would leave the room and come back, the closet door was open. I was sure that the ghost was a friendly one. He would do things that were just annoying and sometimes funny. One time when I was vacuuming, the vacuum just turned itself off. I mean the switch to turn it on, turned off. I used to talk to him and this time said ""stop it, I am busy and I don't appreciate your jokes right now."" 

One time when my brother and SIL came to visit, my landlords, me, my bro, SIL and the next door neighbors were having a BBQ and we were telling stories about our ghostly experiences. The neighbors said that the people that lived there before also attested to the house being haunted. My cigarettes were sitting on the table with the matches, with the cover closed, were laying on top of the pack. All of a sudden the matches all lit up on fire - nothing had touched them. I said ""oh I think our ghosts don't want us talking about them"". Now, the landlord's young son had reoccurring nightmares about the house burning down, and that's when and how I quit smoking. I promised the ghosts that I would stop smoking if they would promise not to play with matches anymore and surprisingly, their son stopped having the nightmares - and I stopped smoking.

I have since moved from Buffalo and live in newer townhouses and have not had any ghostly visitors. I do believe that old places have lingering spirits."
"That's Not My Dog","Ohio","Pets / Animals","I was hesitant to share this story at first. I've always believed it was a paranormal experience; but when telling the story to others, it's hard not to brush it off as ""just a dog"" or ""just my imagination"". But I wasn't the only one to experience this and I've seen so many others have similar stories on this site.

When I was between the ages of 6-11, my younger sister, Mom, Dad and I lived on a large farm. My parents rented the place and though much of the land was used for farming by the land owners, there weren't any actual farm animals on the property. There were acres upon acres of farm land, buildings and barns that hadn't been used in many years, and acres of forest we used for hunting at the rear of the property. Being the independent, Indiana Jones loving tomboy I was; it was heaven and I spent most days out wondering the area alone. 

Now, even though there weren't any farm animals, our family did have pets. There were a ton of indoor and outdoor cats that just kind of showed up and our Labrador mix Ajax. Ajax was a big black mutt who still reigns as the best dog I've ever had in my life. He was so big he played with a bowling ball; rolling it up and down the driveway. He also liked to dunk the more troublesome tom cats in mud puddles... He was awesome.

I think I was 8 or 9 when this incident happened. As usual I was exploring. I know my intention was to go into the hayloft in the biggest of the barns. My friend and I were supposed to go up into it earlier that day, but he chickened out. So here I was at dusk walking down the long lane back to the Black Barn; thinking about what will lay before me after I climb that wooden ladder. (there were so many buildings we named them by color or what we thought they were for; like sheep barn, grain barn, red barn...) 

I was playing with a blade of long grass in my hands and looking down at it when I heard the low growl. Honestly, I thought it was the wind at first. Looking up I saw a big black dog blocking the lane. Obviously, I thought it was Ajax; MY big black dog. I called out and began walking towards him when I heard the growl again. It was a low growl that felt like it made my chest vibrate. Maybe I was just being stupid, but I still thought this was Ajax. I started trying to placate him; ""What's wrong boy?"" ""You ok buddy?"", while still taking hesitant steps towards him.

As I got closer I realized just how much bigger this dog was than Ajax. I remember feeling an icy cold drape over me. This huge black dog was using his body to block my path, head turned towards me growling with his back arched up and his front paws stretched out as if ready to lunge. 

Immediately upon realizing this thing wasn't my dog, I saw Ajax's head out of the corner of my right eye as he came up to stand next to me. Ajax didn't growl. I turned my head to look at him and I heard my Dad behind me say ""Don't move"" in his own human sort of growl. 

I swear the next few seconds play back in my head like some sort of a movie. I was still looking at the dog that wasn't mine; his eyes as black as his fur, when I heard the clicking sound of Dad putting the rifle to his shoulder and hitting the safety. That was the moment I lost all my will; I turned back towards my dad and ran the few steps to him. In those few steps I heard Ajax bark and the gun go off; but I didn't see anything, my arms were wrapped around Dad's waist and my face buried in his beer belly. 

Dad dropped the gun from his shoulder and put his hand on my shoulder; pulling me away from him and making me turn back towards the dog. (While to some it may seem harsh to make your young daughter stare at the dog you just killed, it was pretty normal with my dad/family) 

The thing was, the dog wasn't there... It wasn't laying dead or running down the lane towards the forest or headed to the Black Barn... 

I looked at Ajax, who was still looking in the direction the black dog had been with the fur on the back of his neck raised; then back up at my dad, with what I'm sure was a very shocked look on my face. All he said was ""It's gone. Don't go in the Black Barn again.""

I don't know how he'd known I had been in the barn earlier that day because he was at work; or how he could've known that's where I was going at that time because there were a bunch of buildings back there. 

I'm going to preface the rest of this story with this: just about the only thing my dad and I had in common when I was growing up was a sensitivity to the paranormal and a love of reading. We didn't talk much, but when we did, it was usually about one of those two subjects and after he'd had a few drinks.

So here's the thing, we didn't talk about it right afterward. We were silent during the long walk back to the house that night. But we did talk about it a few weeks later. 

Living out in a rural area you get used to predators like coyotes, foxes, even raccoons (those things are vicious!). And having a lot of barn cats, you get used to them disappearing; either running off or falling prey to one of the aforementioned predators. So, one time at dinner my sister mentioned a cat she hadn't seen for a while and I commented ""I bet it was the black dog."" and my dad said ""Yeah, probably"". I recognized this as my window and asked him about it after dinner.

He told me he'd seen that ""thing"" as he called it, a couple times before. He said it started by seeing it out of the corner of his eyes while he was hunting in the forested back acres. Later, saw it coming out of the Black Barn when he was pulling in after work one night. He said it was always at dawn or dusk when he saw it, when the light was low. 

I specifically asked him about the incident a couple weeks before; what happened to the dog? Where did it go? He said (I swear I will never forget the sound of his voice when he said this for the rest of my life) ""It was just smoke, there was no dog""."
"The House On North Street 2","New York","Haunted Places","This continues the story I started regarding a haunted house in my family which was titled ""The House on North Street"". If you'd like to get the whole story and haven't read that first installment yet, you may want to before reading this 2nd part, it'll definitely make more sense!

Most of this time I remained unaware of what had happened at that house. My parents would take us over a lot when we were younger to play as it seemed to be a popular family hang out when so many people were staying there. This was in the early to mid 80's. I did spend the night more than once and I know my brother and cousin and I slept on the fold out couch in the big living room the night before we went to Arizona to vacation. I didn't even start hearing the stories about the place until my aunt and uncle got ready to move and were going to rent the place out. I do remember the bathroom gave me the creeps, as when I was at the toilet, I always felt watched, from the area of the bathtub but there was never anyone there? 

One time my brother and I had been asked by my aunt and uncle to watch their dogs while they were on vacation. As we approached the house I felt like we were being watched from the window of the upstairs bedroom, the one without electricity. We only found the dog up there laying on the bed in that room. This was before I knew it was haunted. We found one of the dogs had gotten off his chain, so while my brother was out looking for him, I remained behind in the living room. I felt watched from the area of the kitchen and kept turning around. Then as I was watching TV, I felt a brush of air behind me, like someone walking at my back going toward the stairs. I shrugged it off as my imagination but found out later this was a common experience for others. 

My brother told me years later that the night we camped out in the living room, that he was awoken to the feeling of someone shaking the bed. He opened his eyes to a rather stern looking man standing at the end of the bed. He was wearing a white shirt and brown slacks and he straightened up when my brother saw him and turned around and walked into the kitchen. There was some light from the light over the kitchen sink. He whispered to my cousin asking him if he was seeing this. My cousin calmly replied, oh that happens all the time, like it was a common occurrence! I was there, but asleep sandwiched between the 2 of them. My brother watched this 'man' start to walk straight up into open air, right where the stairs used to be!

 My brother told me that later that night I got up to go to the bathroom and that I ran into the infamous 'lady in the purple dress' Apparently it scared me, but I don't remember a thing. I do remember that night, but none of that.

My aunt and uncle moved out around 1990. They rented the place out and then sold it. I heard that the new owners had admitted to some strange goings on, but wouldn't elaborate. 

I have been fascinated with the place ever since. I know at almost every family reunion, someone would invariably come forward with another story about the place. It seemed many of them kept it under wraps until others came forward and then the floodgates opened so to speak on the various experiences. 

As far as my own experiences, they were mild, at least the ones I remember. I can't say whether what my brother said happened with me seeing a ghost or not really happened, as I do not remember it. I do know some of my memories of my time there seem to be missing, and there are other issues in my childhood dealing with anxiety starting at that same time with no real determinable cause. I can say for sure that for years my dreams were 'haunted' about that house. I would be alone in it and I would 'know' that SHE was there waiting for me. The upstairs was her domain. I know that when something traumatic happens to us, if it's bad enough, our mind can block it out. Again this is conjecture, I have no real proof, but I do think there is something to it. 

I tried to search for answers. The library records held no help and even my cousin who became one of the regular contributors to the historical society couldn't find anything. I know it was built in 1895. I contacted the county historian who at the time was writing a book about unsolved murders in the area I grew up in. I figured she would be interested. She researched what she could, she informed me that the house had been owned in the early 1900's by a wealthier individual who rented it out. She came up with a list of names of women who she could trace to living there in an attempt to find out who the mysterious woman was. She found out though that they had all moved out and died in other places, she couldn't come up with anything ever having happened in that house. She surmised that in those early days, if a murder or something had taken place, it might have been covered up, as the wealthier owner certainly wouldn't want his name associated with such a scandal. The look of the woman's dress had been of the 1920's or 30's and it was harder to trace the identity of the various renters in those early years.

I even consulted a psychic who told me that a woman had drowned her children in the bath tub and if someone dug under the house they would find something. If that is in any way true, no wonder I got such a creepy feeling from that bathroom! There is a crawl space at the front of the house, that is accessible. As kids we played near there and it had kind of a weird feeling to it. In fact us kids played ""Witch in the Cellar"" ironically enough at that spot. The neighbors claimed their house was haunted too. The kid who lived there and someone I went to school with, claimed to see a fishing pole levitate on its own in his home.

The house has changed hands once or twice since then and had actually fallen into disrepair and been reclaimed by the bank. It's privately owned now and even though I still visit the area and drive by once in a while, I haven't actually tried to speak with anyone living there to see if they had noticed anything. 

As I mentioned I stayed there a lot as kid, but never found out about the hauntings until I was a teen. While staying at my grandparents, I was privileged to listen in as they retold these old stories and their own experiences. My grandmother and great aunt would talk about it openly, though they never did admit whether they believed it or not. My grandpa would listen but would dismiss the stories as 'nonsense'. Afterwards I became fascinated and visited the actual house again once or twice just prior to my aunt and her family moving out and renting the place.

Again, it's good to get it off my chest! I welcome comments and questions!"
"The House On North Street","New York","Haunted Places","The following is a story I have been wanting to tell for years. I have been on this site reading its multitudes of stories for some time, but this is the first time I am submitting my own. This story centers around a home that was in my family for years and the experiences encountered there occurred over the years to many different family members. I will do my best to relay the events as best I remember them and as chronologically as I can.

This home was purchased by my great aunt in 1946 and hosted a sort of extended family there. In addition to my great aunt, my grandparents (Father's side) my dad and his siblings, and assorted cousins lived there on and off over time. 

There was a cluttered front porch that opened up into a dining room. The back right corner of the dining room would contain the entrance to the one bathroom in the house. There were two doors that opened off the dining room, one led into the kitchen and another into a middle living room. There were actually 2 small living areas leading toward the front of the house. The kitchen had an enclosed back porch that accessed the backyard. The kitchen also had an enclosed staircase complete with door that led to the 2nd story. The upstairs was a unique layout. The stairs led into a short hallway that opened into a large open area that was used for sleeping. At the opposite side of this room and parallel to the small hall, was another hallway. The first room off this hall overlooked the front porch and street and was the only one that wasn't wired for electricity. The hall led to an attic and off the back of the house, three different bedrooms which all linked together. To get to the 3rd bedroom which was my great aunt's you would have to walk through the other 2. It wasn't really designed for privacy apparently. 

I'm not sure when the events actually started, but some of the neighborhood children playing alone upstairs, would come downstairs confused wanting to know who the woman was that was standing at the other end of the upstairs hall. They were certain that all of the adults were downstairs. My great aunt would go upstairs and look around and of course, no one would be up there. There was only one set of stairs and they were in the kitchen which is where my grandparents would camp out most of the day. It was a small town and many parents would just kind of watch the neighbors children by unspoken mutual consent. No one thought of kids wandering in or out or remaining unattended in the house if their playmates (cousins) would wander off. 

It got stranger from there. One morning everyone was to leave for a fishing trip and only my Great Aunt and another aunt would be staying behind. My aunt went upstairs to be sure the beds were made and in one of the rooms, someone was apparently asleep huddled under the blankets. When my aunt went downstairs she mentioned to my aunt that someone stayed behind to which my Great Aunt replied she had just seen everyone off that was in the house, she knew everyone had left. This alarmed my aunt who went upstairs and saw the bed now empty but the sheets were rumpled, as if someone had just been in it. My Great Aunt had been downstairs and had seen no one come out of the stairway, while my other aunt was up there. The bed thing seemed to be a recurring issue, many times after all the beds were made they were found messed up again even with only one other person in the house. My relatives say it wasn't the kids wandering in and out because the kids always announced their presence and they could be heard when playing. This also happened after the kids were in school as well.

The sightings continued. One day one of my cousins wanted to know who the woman was upstairs who went into the attic. Of course another search found no one up there.

 One cousin stated she had been pushed downstairs, but most of my family said she was kind of clumsy so they wrote that claim off. One of the cousins staying there had went to go downstairs to get a drink of water but as he entered the stairwell he saw a woman standing at the bottom of the stairs. He didn't recognize her but when she started to float up the stairs toward him that put an end to his desire for a drink, and he fled back to his room.

 My Great Aunt would be woken up many nights to find a woman rummaging through her trunk at the end of her bed. The unidentified woman would look up and then fade away. Footsteps would be heard on the stairs at night, too many to be discounted as the house settling. Many nights my aunt would come down in the middle of the night and hear the sound of dishes being washed or the the floor being swept. The first time she was confused but didn't question it too much and went back up. The next morning the floor was still dirty and the dishes still dirty and in the sink. Many people had this kind of encounter over the years and to my knowledge no one actually investigated while the noises were heard. I finally heard years later from different family members that while they were having these experiences they rarely spoke of them for fear of being ridiculed and some just flat out refused to believe it was happening!

Finally one day, my dad while a teenager was upstairs getting something from under his bed. His bed was in the big open area upstairs. When he turned around, SHE was right there. It was the closest of the encounters that had occurred to my knowledge. My Great Aunt and grandparents (his parents) were at the kitchen table when he came downstairs apparently white as a sheet. He talked about it then but has clammed up over the years. He described this woman as wearing a purple dress, old fashioned, maybe like something from the 20's or 30's. She also wore a cameo pin. What scared him so bad was that she had no face, just a dark spot where her face should be. Prior to this, most people had only seen her in the dark, but this was in broad daylight. I had heard the story from my grandmother and fascinated I asked my dad about it, but he got kind of short with me and says it was so long ago he couldn't really remember.

My Uncle Pete, who was dating my youngest aunt had some interesting encounters. One night while he and my aunt were snoozing on the couch downstairs, he felt someone tap him on the shoulder and awaken him whispering his name. He came to and saw only my aunt near him sleeping soundly. He caught the movement of someone moving up the stairs. He knew full well that they were alone and so leaving my aunt he pursued the 'intruder' upstairs. He saw someone at the end of the hall go into one of the bedrooms, but when he went in there and turned on the light, no one was in there. As he turned around, he saw this 'person' go into another room further down the hall. When he got to that room, no one was there! This game went on for some time, before he gave up! Another night he came to their house drunk and though his memory isn't the best, he thought my aunt (his future wife) threw him out in the snow! In the morning my aunt told him she had stayed in her room the whole night and no one else had been at home at the time. My Uncle swears it was a stern angry sounding woman who tossed him out in a snow bank! No one admitted to this incident and my aunt says she didn't even know he had come.

In the 80's my Great Aunt leased the house to my aunt, my dad's sister, to have for her growing family while she moved into an apartment. My aunt woke up one night to see someone standing over her. She screamed and turned on the light but no one was there.

 My cousin claimed someone grabbed him one night upstairs in the dark. Both of my cousins state that on more than one occasion they had seen a man lying on the floor upstairs and when they attempted to approach him, he would get up and go into another room and lay back down.

My Aunt & Uncle began to remodel the place and knocked out the walls to the downstairs rooms including the kitchen as well as moving the stairs from the back of the house in the kitchen to the front in the living room. They were making the whole downstairs one huge open area and in doing so found what appeared to be the bones to a hand, which they assumed to be a monkey's paw. They threw them out and didn't have them analyzed or notify anyone of what they had found. My other Uncle had told me that he had knocked a hole in the wall of the room upstairs without electricity and had found a mummified hand there. He also tossed it without telling anyone, god only knows why? This same Uncle one time entered my Great Aunt's bedroom while she was still staying there and saw a woman standing near the trunk, she appeared to looking for something in the trunk and promptly disappeared upon being discovered. I did hear that for a while, the footsteps on the stairs stopped and then eventually resumed. I guess moving the stairs must have confused the ghost for some time!

There is a 2nd part to this story, containing my own experiences there but it's so long already, I figured I'd split it into 2 parts. I wanted to include as much as know, not to make a longer story but to try and give a complete picture. I have always enjoyed the stories on here that were rather detailed. I will be glad to answer any questions I can. Be aware many of these older relatives involved have passed on, so questioning certain people is not always an option here."
"At Gigi's House","Ohio","Haunted Places","When I was between 4 and 6 my sister and I were babysat by my Grandma, who we called GiGi. GiGi lived in a Victorian style house built in 1896 (just looked that up to verify). If you've read my previous story, this house is actually less than a block away from the theater. 

GiGi was a stern, small woman, but she was nurturing. She kept us clean and well fed like grandparents are supposed to. In fact, it seems like she was always cooking or baking something. She always had a utensil in her hand and she had no problem giving you a whack on the top of the head if you got out of line. She even did it to my grandpa sometimes; I can still hear him saying ""Dammit, Darlene!"" after she'd whack him. 

As I said, GiGi's house was Victorian in style. There were so many rooms, doors, huge windows; and all the kinds of cupboards, closets and hiding spots your young heart could desire. Almost all the downstairs rooms had dividers that you could pull out of a gap in the doorframe to make one large room two smaller ones. 

GiGi's house also had some sort of entity and whatever this thing was didn't seem to like kids. Whether you would call it a poltergeist or spirit, I honestly don't know. Though I've always been very sensitive to the paranormal, I've never had a desire to really study it. Now, as an adult, I make it a point to keep my mental walls up to protect myself. But I digress...

In almost every memory I have regarding events in her house, GiGi always seemed nonchalant about it. I don't know if she believed it was supernatural and had become accustomed to it or what but she just kept on doing whatever it was she was doing without making a comment. Later, when I was older and brought it up, she would wave it off without a word. My Dad always told me speaking on things of this nature gave it more life, so maybe she felt the same?

As I said before, she spent a lot of time in the kitchen. I can remember sitting at the table with my sister and watching the cabinet doors open. They didn't open fast or forcefully; they just would swing open randomly. It was never just one, but one after another three or four would swing open. GiGi was short, so usually she used the handle of whatever she had in hand to close them without even looking up. Sometimes she would have to get one of her many step stools to reach, but she never said a word about it and neither did we.

It also like to slam doors behind me in particular. It seemed like every time I walked out of a room or out of the house, the door would slam shut behind me. Eventually I got used to it and to always being yelled at by whatever adult happened to be near. I can remember the sound the glass panes in the front door would make when it would slam. 

One of my more terrifying memories happened in the small mud room off the kitchen. It had a door into it from the kitchen, one leading to the back yard, and one leading into the cellar. 

There were two girls close to my sister's and my ages who we would play with whenever they were around. They didn't live with their mother, the next door neighbor, full time so it was always exciting when they were around. 

One day I heard what I thought was one of them calling to me from the backyard. I went to get my sister and hightailed it to the back door. We made it into the mudroom before the door from the kitchen behind us slammed shut. It made both of us jump and look back towards the door, but we shrugged it off and tried to open the door leading to the backyard. It was locked. These doors were old, requiring a key to lock and unlock them. So we turned around to head back into the kitchen, knowing without the key we weren't getting outside, but now this door wouldn't open either. The kitchen door didn't have a lock on it though and we should have been able to easily open it.

At this point I wasn't panicking. The door into the backyard had a large pane of glass in it so I started looking outside for our friends to see if they could help. But neither of them were in the yard. Looking back now I should have thought it was weird that anyone would be in the backyard. You could only get into it from the back door or from the side privacy fence that had a padlock on it. 

Now I was starting to freak out and began yelling and alternating between trying the knob and banging on the door to the kitchen. At some point though, it just swung open. I was smacking the door with both palms and it swung open with nobody there. I felt like we were stuck in there forever, and honestly I don't know how long it was, but I know my throat hurt from yelling by the end.

Turns out GiGi was vacuuming in one of the front rooms and had no idea what happened to us. I remember my sister and I standing in the foyer with tears running down both our faces watching GiGi, wondering if I would get in trouble for saying anything. I never did bring it up.

The living room, sitting room, dining room, and foyer created a circle that my sister and I were chasing either other back and forth around. We were probably being hellions, screaming and running past all GiGi's antiques. 

I remember hearing the word ""Stop!"" yelled, but I'd be lying if I said I knew for sure it wasn't GiGi that said it. I just feel like it wasn't her. What I do remember is running full speed smack into the room dividers that had been pulled shut between the sitting and dining rooms. Both sides of it had been shut completely. There was nobody who could've done it. GiGi was in the kitchen and my sister was too little to have pulled them out quickly enough before I made the lap around the rooms. I ended up with a bloody nose that day.

GiGi had a swing on the front porch that the neighbors and I loved hanging out on. There was a large picture window behind the swing with 2 smaller windows that opened on each side of it. These opened in a way that you pulled a cord in the window frame and it would raise the bottom pane, leaving a gap between it and the window sill. GiGi would prop the windows up with a 6 inch wooden dowel rod.

Now that the scene is set. While my friend and I were sitting on the swing, I put my hand on the window sill, using it as leverage to push us since neither of us were tall enough for our feet to reach the floor. I don't remember how long we had been sitting there before the window came down on my hand. The dowel rod she used to prop the window up actually fell outside of the window onto the porch, as if it had been pushed through from the inside. 

Luckily, only my finger tips were in reach of the window when it came down. No bones were broken, but 3 of my fingernails turned black & blue. Funny side note: 2 of my 3 band-aids were eaten by a goose that chased me at the park later that day.

These sort of events happened often. I can think of so many right now, not all of which did someone get hurt though. Like when something dumped baby powder all over the bathroom one night. 

One of the most extreme centered around my uncle's room upstairs. I remember GiGi had been on him about cleaning his room. As a teenager he always replied with ""I did!"" before promptly leaving to skateboard with friends. Finally, GiGi had had enough and decided that we were going to do it and do it right.

She and I, with my little sister making more of a mess than helping, spent the entire afternoon cleaning his room. He had the typical dishes and dirty clothes laying around, but I mostly just remember how he had stuff EVERYWHERE. Clothes, books, cassettes, just stuff all over the floor.

The only odd thing I can remember about that room was that the windows looked to have condensation on them. I thought it was weird at the time because it was summer and wasn't rainy that day, why was there water on the windows? I don't remember it being cold in there though and this house didn't have AC, not even a window unit.

After we finished, we waited for him to come home. I remember feeling kind of smug; hands on my hips walking next to GiGi as we headed up to his room to show him how it should be done. But when she opened that door... It was the only time I can remember her acting startled about the happenings in that house. 

Stuff was EVERYWHERE once again. Though the trash and dishes weren't in there, it looked like someone had thrown the clothes out from every drawer and the books and cassettes were again all over the floor. His bedding was torn of the bed GiGi had shown me how to make just a couple hours before. I was shocked. 

We never actually went back into the room. She had opened the door to show him and when we all saw the mess she stood there for a second before shutting the door again. I remember looking at my uncle, he was so much taller than both me and GiGi. I look back now on the face he made and I want to think it was something like ""I told you so"" but maybe that's my imagination.

Like I said, there were so many things that would happen in that house and I'm sure much more was experienced by the ones who actually lived there full time. I would have to look up exactly how long they lived in that house, but I do know they sold it less than 6 months after the bedroom incident. (I did some digging to verify that statement.) I don't know if that had anything to do with why they sold it when they did, but if it were me as an adult now... I think that would have been the last straw."
"My Husband And The Ghost?","California","Succubus / Incubus / Sexual Ghosts","I am not sure how to explain this experience, or what do to about it all, but I really need help in stopping what ever is happening from destroying my marriage. I have gone over this story a couple of times and tried my best to remove anything that was too graphic because I want to be taken seriously. I am a 34 years old and married 12 years to a wonderful man. We have a beautiful daughter of 11 that we both love to spoil terribly. We are not religious and before all of this I would never believe a story like this one. I am trying to figure out how to tell this tale with out sounding like someone that should be committed.

We recently purchased our dream home in a more rural area of our state and have been settling in fairly well until the last 3 weeks or so. Things started with just noticing little movements in the corner of my eye in our bedroom at night. Shadows what would move when there was nothing to cause the movement. They seem centered around the corner of our room by the walk in closet. At first I just put it off to being a new home and not being used to the way lights move when a car drives by outside but since noticing the shadows, more things have been happening.

I started to notice that the closet door was always open when I looked at it. I was sure I closed it but then next time I walked into the room it would be open. My husband thought I was was just imagining it or that my daughter was playing a trick on me. We tested it together once by closing the door and leaving the room to check on our daughter. When we both returned the door was partly open. My husband joked we must have bought a house on an Indian burial ground. I tried to laugh and accept it as a quirk of the house, but recently things have started to happen in our bed at night. 

I have been waking up at night feeling the bed shift. For a while I put it off to my husband rolling over and ignored it. Last week I was again awakened by a movement of the bed. It was almost rhythmic. At first I thought it was my husband rolling over but I felt it again when I was awake. My husband was asleep next to me not moving but I noticed his breathing was a bit fast and I wondered if maybe he was having dream. It was a warm night and we had just been using sheets to stay cool and I was about to lay down when I felt the shift of weight again. 

This time I was looking at my husband and he had definitely not shifted but he did let out a low moan like you would in a dream if something was bothering you. I looked around the bed for a source of the movement and noticed the sheet shift at my husbands waist. His hands where both under his pillow since he likes to sleep that way on his back hands under his head. I could see movement under the sheets at his groin and thought for a moment he was having a nice dream but then they moved again and it wasn't a movement that a dream could cause. I gently moved the sheets aside to see my husband's boxers pulled down and him in an erect state. I am not sure how to tell this and try to keep things from sounding like a bad R rated movie, but as I watched him, things moved in ways they should not be able to on their own. Skin was moving like it was being touched and he was breathing heavy. I was scared not understanding what was going on. I thought maybe I was dreaming or going crazy. I said his name a few times but he did not respond. I shook him and finally his eyes opened and looked at me, but then he moaned. I shook him harder and then everything stopped. He was awake, looking at me and confused. 

I told him everything that had happened and he told me that maybe he had dream, but he swears he had felt something down there. He said it was a gentle almost electric feeling of pin pricks and feather touches that felt very sexually intense. I was at a loss for words. I didn't know what to think or do. I was suddenly intensely jealous. He was still in a state and said he could feel it faintly and almost wished that I had not woken him up. I just looked at him a moment not believing what he just said, then I angrily got out of bed and went and slept on the couch.

In the morning I went in to our bedroom to talk to him and found him asleep naked with all our sheets his boxers and tee shirt thrown to the floor. The bed looked like it does after one of our own energetic romps and I could smell his lingering scent still in the air that told me something had brought him to climax. I stormed out of the room and went to get my daughter her breakfast and when he got up he looked sheepish and guilty. We didn't say three words to each other and he quietly got ready for work and left me with my daughter and a whirlwind of emotions. I went into angry cleaning mode and changed the bedding that still smelled of him and then started cleaning the rest of the house while my daughter played on her PlayStation. She asked if we were fighting and I admitted to her I was a little mad at daddy. She asked if it was because of all the noise he made last night? And I looked at her confused and asked her what noise? She said daddy was moaning all night and she wondered if maybe he was sick. I told her not to worry and I made her lunch and talked to her about how her school would work this year with distance learning. 

When my husband got home I asked him what had happened and he looked at me shaking his head and said he really didn't know. He said after I left the room he felt like a flood of static pinpricks, as you would feel when your arm falls asleep, it slowly crept up his legs. He said it felt good but it frightened him a little too. When the feeling reached his hips and his privates all the feelings returned even stronger than before. He said he remembered not being able to resist the feelings as they where far beyond anything he had ever felt with me. He said they went on and on for quite a while. And he eventually passed out and fell asleep. He told me he was sorry and he loved me and he didn't want it to happen and he was frightened by how seductive the feelings where and that he couldn't resist responding to them. I could see he was really upset and scared. So I just held him and told him everything was going to be alright. Nervously we went to bed that night. 

At a little after 2:00am I awoke to the bed moving again and a moan from my husband. What ever it is, it was attacking him again I could see his state and I hugged him and told him it would be OK. I looked around the room told what ever it was to go away! I pulled back the sheets and again his boxers where down and he was being molested. He awoke and looked at me scared and I told it again to stop and to go find someone else. My husband looked me in the eyes and gasped that he was sorry and climaxed. I had never seen anything like it. I was so scared and jealous. After that everything stopped again and we just held each other and he kept telling me he was sorry and I kept saying it wasn't his fault.

This has been happening almost every night now and I am am exhausted from lack of sleep. My husband is feeling horrible about it but he says its not a feeling he can fight since it starts when he is asleep. I do not know what to do but I am jealous and hurt and I don't know what is doing this to him. I am afraid something is taking my husband from me and I can't fight it. I know this all sounds crazy and I must be insane but... I saw this site and read the stories here and they all sounded similar to what we are experiencing. What can I do? I am at wits end. How can this all be real?"
"One Last Walk For Shandy","Washington","Pets / Animals","Shandy was my late husband's Fox Terrier. In May, soon after my husband passed away, we noticed that Shandy wasn't quite as happy-go-lucky as he used to be. Shandy had always been energetic and playful, even though he was considered an older dog. Usually he loved playing fetch in the back yard with our children, or going on walks, but lately he seemed not as interested in the outdoors. I chalked this up to him missing my husband, and possibly feeling a bit lonely.

 When my husband was alive, every morning and afternoon he would take Shandy for walks to the nearby park, or local beaches. I knew that those walks were so important to Shandy; he so loved all the attention he got from my husband. Then one day, a few weeks ago, I noticed that Shandy didn't want to go for a walk. When I tried to get him up from his bed to play fetch, he didn't seem excited or even interested in going outside. I felt something wasn't right, so I called the Veterinarian's office and made an appointment for Shandy to have a wellness exam.

Later that evening Shandy wouldn't eat his dinner. I had a strange feeling that I should sleep in the living room that night, on the couch, near Shandy's bed so that I could keep an eye on him.

 I can't remember when I finally fell asleep that night, but I woke up around 4:00am to the sound of Shandy pawing at the front door. I sat up quickly and called out to him - Hold on, Shandy! I was so relieved that he was back to his old self again; I jumped up from the couch and ran toward the front door to meet him. To get to the front door from our living room, you must go through a short hallway and then into a foyer where the front door is located. Once I was in the hallway I could see Shandy waiting at the front door, wagging his tail, anxiously jumping up and down (as per usual). Realizing I forgot my shoes in the other room, I turned around and ran back into the living room. I hollered back to Shandy- Be right back, boy! As I entered the room, I happened to glance toward Shandy's dog bed. There he was, laying motionless in his bed, his big brown eyes open, but looking lifeless. I walked over to him, knelt down and pet his fur - I sensed that he had passed away sometime during the night. Did I just experience Shandy's spirit, or was it 'residual' Shandy? Right at that moment, it occurred to me that maybe Shandy might have been letting me know that he was finally feeling better, now that he had passed on.

 Shandy was a part of our family for nearly 13 years, and we miss him a lot. I guess I'll never really know what that was all about, but I feel comforted by the vision that I had of Shandy appearing happier and more carefree, just like he used to be..."
"Daytime Dark Shadow","Alabama","Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis","I have always been a believer of the supernatural, and I always enjoyed watching shows about people who have had an experience somehow. I had never had anything happen to me personally that I could say without a doubt, was supernatural.

 On my way to work one day I was listening to a radio talk show about apps you can get on your phone to ""track"" a ghost, much like the evp stuff you see on ghost hunting shows. I downloaded a couple different ones just for fun, to see how it worked and how ""fake"" they probably were, I mean like computer generated stuff to jump out and scare you, corny stuff. Anyway, I played around with a few on my phone at work for a bit, but after it got dark and I was alone in the office, I chickened out lol. I never saw anything or got any so called proof. By the way, I work the night shift, so I sleep during the day. 

Well, after I got home, I pretty much didn't think anything else about it. I did my usual routine, ate, watched tv and went to sleep. A little while later, I thought I was having a dream but opened my eyes to a dark figure on top of me. It was leaning over me, chocking me, and saying that I could ""fight all I want but I can't stop it"". It said ""I'm too powerful now"". I remember thinking that my roommate was in the next room, so if I could just somehow make a noise loud enough for him to hear, than he would come to check on me and hopefully scare off this thing! I was unable to speak because it's grip was getting tighter and tighter. I could feel this overwhelming sense of terror that I've never experienced before! I tried grabbing the pillow beside me to use to push something off my side table in hopes that someone would hear it, but I could not get a good grip on it. I tried to scream or yell out my roommate's name, but I could barely get a sound out. I heard someone walking down the hall to the bathroom that is right outside my door and the dark shadow turned towards the door which loosened up it's grip on my throat long enough for me too scream as loud as I could possibly scream! Just as I did that, the figure vanished and my roommate came running in to see what was going on. I was shaking so bad, and crying hysterically trying to tell him what had just happened but I could barely get any words out. I was so scared that this thing would come back that I slept on the couch for a week.

 I've tried looking up info about things like this but most articles say that its sleep paralysis and I don't agree. I'm not sure what it was but I have never had anything like that happen to me before. I'm not sure if I somehow opened up some portal with one of those apps or if the 2 are just a coincidence. Since that happened, I can't shake this uneasy feeling that never goes away. I just have this really bad feeling and I don't know why, even when things are good. Maybe it's just me and my overactive imagination?! Thanks for giving me a place to tell my story where people don't think I'm crazy lol!"
"Strange Occurrences At A Haunted Theatre","Ohio","Haunted Places","Small town in Ohio. I began working for a local non-profit that was restoring an historic theater/cinema and all of these events took place there. I was not the only one to witness some of these events, but because the building was bought by a local church and donated to the non-profit; as well as for the sake of it's reputation, we were all told rather strictly not to mention/talk about any supernatural events. Even if asked directly about them. 

When I first started as the Executive Assistant, my boss the Executive Director; joked about how employees believed the building was haunted and some of them even refused to go in specific parts of the building. Being a believer of the supernatural, but knowing a lot of stories can be simply chalked up to imagination, I never expected to see anything... I was very wrong.

The building being restored was an active movie and performing arts theater; my job during the week was to act as an assistant for the non-profit and as a cinema manager on weekends. My boss was a micromanager who was VERY particular, so it took nearly 2 months before I was allowed to close down by myself. The first event happened the very first time I closed without her.

After the last movie, myself and about 6 other employees were cleaning up. On Saturdays we did a deeper clean than just sweeping up popcorn; mopping, wiping down chairs and bathrooms ect. I was in the lobby talking with an employee when another employee we'll call D, asked me to go upstairs to turn on the brighter lights in the cinema area. D was one who refused to go upstairs, even with a group.

I immediately jog (yes jogged, it was my first time managing these employees by myself and wanted to make a good impression) over to and up the stairs to the projection room where the lights are. I passed nobody as I did this; D had gone back into the cinema area and the other employee I was talking to started vacuuming the lobby. But, when I got to the door of the projection room, I saw that the lights had already been switched on; so I jogged back down to the cinema area. Nobody was upstairs with me during this time and the upstairs lights were off except in the projection room.

When I got to the door of the cinema, I noticed D and another employee T standing in the middle of the room looking up into the windows of the projection room. They see me walk in and both look shocked as they look back up to the windows. At this point I've reached them and look to where T is pointing. There I see a shadow-like figure moving around in the projection room. We all are seeing the same thing; a shadow walking back and forth across the room upstairs.

Now, to be fair, anyone would look shadowy from this angle, lighting and distance... So though I was creeped, I wasn't freaking out like D and T. I tell them it's probably another employee, even though I KNOW I didn't pass anyone upstairs, and get back to work. 

A couple minutes after I've left the area, D comes to get me saying she's found muddy foot prints. I follow her down to the very front of the cinema and see muddy bare foot prints starting by one of the emergency exits. It had been raining all that evening so my immediate thought was that someone had come in the emergency exit. I grab some employees to check the doors and restrooms, but I was honestly too afraid to look upstairs after the shadow person. We didn't find anyone, but upon closer inspection we noticed that the footprints went about 15 feet from the exit doors and then just stopped... Only to reappear in an entirely different area of the room. The seating area fit about 450 people so the room was huge, and we found 5 very distinct places where the prints started for a few feet and just stopped. These were muddy, bare, average size, foot prints; they didn't look like anything else and all 4 or 5 of us agreed on what they seemed to be. 

Trying to be a good manager I attempt to act cool and ignore my goosebumps to mop them up myself. D told me that she'd seen these prints before and told my boss, who brushed it off, and of course 2 weeks later it happened again. This time they weren't in the same spots and it wasn't raining, but there they were. 

Months later, I was in my upstairs office. My desk faced the door of my office, which faced the door into the projection room. As I was at my computer, I felt an odd tingle sensation over my whole body and thought I saw something move behind my computer. I looked into the projection room expecting a mouse or bat (normal occurrence). Hopefully this part makes sense - I had my eyes focused and on the lookout for a critter, after not seeing one I sort of pulled my gaze back from the projection room and into the doorway of my office and literally it felt like my heart stopped. It physically hurt. In my doorway was a very translucent, almost clear figure. I felt like it was a man and tall, nearly filling the entire doorway, but it had no discernible features. You could easily see through the middle of the figure but the outside edges had this odd wave-like quality to them; like heat waves on a road.

I didn't move and looked down at my keyboard waiting for it to go away; but terrified at the idea of it coming towards me. Eventually, the feeling of being watched left and when I looked up it was gone. The whole thing was probably only a minute or so, but it felt like hours.

Another time I had gone upstairs to grab a report for the boss. She had just had someone there about renovations so all of the upstairs lights had been left on after they left. 

I was going through all the rooms (parts of the building had been used as an apartment by the person who built it in 1905 so there were a lot) turning lights off before heading into my office for the report. While there I got a landline call, but a few seconds into the call it went to static and a few seconds after that, the call dropped. In a matter of seconds I hang up, grab the report, and walk out of my office backwards turning out the light. When I turned around every light I had just turned off was back on. Every... Single... One. I felt my stomach drop and ran down the stairs; heading straight outside to have a smoke with shaking hands. I'm not sure if the interference on the call had anything to do with this event, but it was an odd coincidence if not.

Once, my boss, the hard nose skeptic experienced something. I was returning from a late lunch to attend a board meeting I wasn't excited to attend. At this point I'd been at work for 9 hours and only left for about 30 minutes to grab food. When I was walking up to the main glass doors I saw my boss looking out the door with a rather angry face. So of course I was annoyed thinking she was upset with me for leaving for half an hour (something she did often but that's another story). 

After walking in she told me that she thought someone was in the building. As we were searching, she told me that while in her downstairs office she heard a man saying ""hello"". She called back to it and looked around, but found nobody. Thinking maybe she had butt dialed or there was a phone glitch, she checked her cell and the landline; neither of which had anyone on the line. Still hearing the hellos, she started trying to follow it; yelling ""hello"" back. But each time she got to the area she thought it came from, it would call out from across the building. Of course we found nobody when we searched.

Other incidents: 

- Seeing a full bodied white translucent man in a suit walking between seats in the cinema area before disappearing.

- Contractors swearing they saw a figure or heard talking in the building when nobody was there.

- Sink in the men's restroom turning on full blast nearly every night. It was so bad that I began taking pictures of it off each night for proof, because boss thought patrons were leaving it on and I wasn't catching it before leaving.

- Feeling of being watched when alone or an overwhelming sense of fear for no apparent reason.

Though it's old and there were reportedly at least 2 fires, there haven't been any confirmed deaths in the building. But the man who built it was at one point a vaudeville star. After the first fire and the fall of vaudeville; there was a second fire that took out the majority of the stage area and the entire 3rd floor. At this point he was bankrupt and some believed he set the fire intentionally for insurance money. He sold the building to a man who turned it into a cinema. My theory is that the vaudeville star is haunting the building."
"My Sister's House Is Haunted","Utah","Haunted Places","My sister's house has always been creepy to me, and this is not the first strange or paranormal thing that has happened to me in her house. Many family members have heard footsteps on the stairs, had items disappear and reappear, heard things, and seen things. Most people in my family are firm believers in the paranormal and have had experiences of their own, so I grew up on ghost stories, and have experiences ghosts/spirits and the like throughout my life. 

This story in particular begins after my sister asked me to house sit for her. She has pets; dogs, cats, and fish that all needed fed and cared for. I arrived at her house after a shift at work. I work the afternoon shifts, so I arrived at her house with my dog and my pillow at about eleven p.m. 

I was tired from work, so I quickly fed the animals, and crawled into my sister's bed with my dog, her dog, and her cat. I was laying in bed, scrolling through my phone, when I heard a sound in the bathroom. I looked up through the open bathroom door (it was left open so that the cats could get into their litter box throughout the night.) It was too dark to see anything, but I shrugged it off, because my sister's house is older than dirt, and old houses make noises. Then I heard the noise again but louder, and my dog had stood up and was now standing on the edge of the bed barking in the direction of the bathroom. My sister's dog, which is a lot bigger than my dog, was also growling, a deep growl. I squinted again in the darkness, I still couldn't see anything, but I heard footsteps. I jumped out of bed and turned on the light, and the footsteps stopped, but the dogs were still growling. 

I called out to whatever was there to leave me alone. The dogs slowly stopped barking and growling, and they didn't bark or growl like that for the rest of the night or for the rest of the time I was there, though throughout the duration of my house sitting experience, I heard more footsteps, this time on the stairs, small noises, and even the sound of a woman screaming. My brother was with me for the latter and said that he had heard the scream too."
"Tall Shadowy Figure","Utah","Shadow People","This experience took place about five years ago. I was seventeen at the time, and it was a hot summer afternoon. I was in my parent's bedroom looking for some batteries for the T.V. Remote when something felt ""off"" I don't know how to explain or describe it. I looked up from the drawer I was digging in, and through the window I saw a tall, dark, shadowy, blacker than black figure walk by the window. I watched as it moved quickly past the window. 

I wondered at first if it was my grandfather walking by, he lives in a sort of add on apartment and often walks around the house to feed his dogs in the back yard. He's a big and tall dude, but this thing was taller, and it's head was level with the top of the window frame. I ran to the second window on the other side of my parent's bed to see if I could get a better look at who or what it was, but it was gone, and so was the weird feeling I'd had. 

I went outside later that night and measured the height of the window, because I'd seen people walk by that window before, and none of them came close to being tall enough that their head was level with the top of the window. The shadow man would have had to have been almost eight feet tall! 

I saw this shadow figure again about a week later, but this time it was walking past the large windows of the front room. I got that same weird feeling, but it was gone again in an instant just like the first sighting. I haven't seen it again since that time, though I sometimes will still get that ""off"" feeling. 

After seeing it a second time I decided to tell my brother about it, because he also believes in ghosts, spirits, and the like. He said that he had seen something similar to what I'd described standing outside of his window next to a storage shed we have in our back yard. We wonder if the shadow man is connected to something in the back yard, because both times I'd seen it, it was walking toward the back yard, and my brother had seen it in the back yard. 

Any ideas what this tall, shadowy figure might be?"
"The Little Girl At The School House","Tennessee","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","This account takes place in my hometown on the Tennessee/Kentucky border in February of 1991. I was a Junior in high school, and had a part-time job cleaning a small private elementary school and the adjacent gym on the weekends. The school building itself was a converted two story farmhouse, and the gym was a large metal building. The schoolyard has several large oak trees, one of them well over 100 years old.

 One very cold Sunday night, at around 9:30,I,my girlfriend at the time, her sister and step sister, were riding around looking for something to do, and we decided to stop by the gym I just mentioned and play some basketball, just basically shoot around. As we pulled up to the gym, no other cars were there, and the only light was coming from a street light in the school yard. The gym sits on a built-up area and just downhill from it was a group of oak trees, one of which had an old fashioned rope and plank swing hanging from a branch. 

As we made our way to the door I was fishing for my keys and I happened to glance in the direction of that swing. I did a double take when I realized there was a girl who looked to be around 8-10 sitting on the swing. She had on a long light colored dress, had long dark hair, but I couldn't make out her face because she was back-lit by the street light.""That door is open already""she said to us.Thanks,I said, and we went on in. I assumed that even though there was no car outside, she must be there with someone who had already gone in the gym.

 We found the place totally dark and unoccupied, and after a few minutes got bored with basketball and decided to leave. As we were walking to the car, I glanced down toward the swing, more curious this time and she was still there just as she had been a short while ago. We made it out to the end of the long driveway before I decided to go back and ask her if she was lost. As we made our way back over to the school, we could all plainly see her as she was now running around and seemingly playing in the light of the street lamp. As we closed to within maybe 100 feet of her, she simply wasn't there anymore, and neither were 4 freaked out teenagers who booked it out of there as fast as a 1985 Chevy Celebrity station wagon would take us!"
"Need Help Identifying Dark Black Wolf Looking Sprit","New York","Pets / Animals","Last night was REALLY creepy. It started off normal, and I went upstairs. I was going into the bathroom before I went to bed, but then I felt that I needed to shut the door as fast as I could. I was breathing heavily and I don't know why. I was in the bathroom and felt like an idiot because my parents probably heard me slam the door. But at the same time, I felt just relieved to be safe, like everything was ok in the bathroom. 

 I just opened the door feeling normal, then there was a ton of creaks coming from the ceiling. When I was little I always asked what they were and my parent just ignored me or said it was the house settling in. But it somehow felt different this time, like something was in the attic. The attic is just a tiny crawl space in my house and only accessible trough one small hole in a room. So I rushed into my bedroom, and didn't feel safe. I felt the urge to check my closet and under my bed (this was all late at night) but there was nothing.

After a while I calmed down and tried to fall asleep, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was closely watching me. At this point it was almost 4 am and I was really tired and I just fell asleep. The second I fell asleep I could see everything perfectly, and I could remember it clear as day the next morning. My dream started in the hallway and everything was normal. I started to return to my room in the dream, but then I saw something that frightens me until this very day. It was me laying in the bed, and a dark black wolf looking animal was staring at other Ike in the bed. Then it focused on me and other me disappeared. It was just staring at me, and it was bigger then I thought, maybe even bigger then a Saint Bernard, but had all the features of a wolf, the head the tail, everything. Just bigger. I couldn't remember the face clearly, it might of had a glowing diamond shape on its head, but maybe not. I instantly woke up and panicked in my room. There was nothing, but I still had the feeling that something was watching me and was watching me closely. 

I still get the feeling that something is watching me in my room, I tried recording my sleep one night, but I never looked at the footage because on the chance that there was something there, I would never be able to sleep peacefully in that room or probably even anywhere. Please help me identify the wolf looking spirit, I tried doing some research, but didn't know where to start, so I'm hoping you guys know what that thing was."
"Help! This Spirit Won't Leave Me Alone!","Michigan","Ouija Board / Seances","This story starts back in September of 2019. We randomly had an Ouija board downstairs in our basement and it had been down there for years even before I knew what it was. One day I got the idea to just see what would happen if I tried it but I got nothing. Then on another occasion after that I tried it, I think I may have gotten some movement but nothing that was really responsive. I don't remember if I requested any presences from anyone, I think I just wanted to see if the scope would even move.

 The third time, I was a little bit more prepared or so I thought. I brought some palo santo with me (I didn't have sage at the time), a few candles, and I set an intention that only beings with good intentions were allowed to contact me and nothing else was allowed. I wanted to speak to my ancestors but I was open to anyone speaking to me. This time, I actually got an answer.

 At first it kept spelling out a bunch of random letters for like 30 minutes. He managed to tell me that he was my 4th generation great-grandfather or something along those lines (A family member who I wasn't familiar with) but kept talking gibberish. At one point I had enough and said ""I'm sorry, I can't understand you."" then ended the session. I tried to start a new session but the same spirit showed up. I should have just ended it there but I was curious as to why he still wanted to talk to me. After more time, all of a sudden it started talking like normal. The spirit said that it was all a prank and that he was a family member I knew. He said he was my 1st grandfather and I believed that because from the stories I had been told, he was a bit of a prankster.

Side note, I had never met any of these family members before they died but I have heard countless stories. I have also always wanted to talk to them because even though I never met them, I have felt connected in some sort of way. Unfortunately, this is what made it so easy for the spirit to trick me. Even I know about them through stories, I don't know them as actual people so I just have a general idea of what they would be like. The spirit could easily manipulate me and try to be like them as much as possible or also try fill in the gaps of what parts of their personality I didn't exactly know about.

Once I found out who I thought I was talking to, we chit chatted for a few hours and I asked a bunch of random questions. Long story short, not only did the spirit make me believe that I was talking to a dead family member of mine, throughout our conversation he tricked me into thinking I had a dead sister that I had no idea about and fed me a bunch of other random lies. After a while, it was late and I was tired so I went back upstairs to sleep, planning to talk to this 'sister' the next day.

 I woke up the next day after I got home from running errands, I immediately went back downstairs to the board. Me and this sister would talk about anything for hours end for at least two weeks. I had my suspicions and sometimes I felt really weird after using the board but I didn't think too much of it.

 Then one day me and the 'sister' were talking and 'she' said that I had a family member who was alive and whom I didn't know about yet (They were also supposedly from another country). Apparently, 'she' had the phone number for this family member and gave it to me. Through an international calling app, I tried to contact the person but it didn't go through. Afterwards, I really began to suspect that I was not talking to my family members and that it was something else. I tell the 'sister' that I was suspicious and I asked if I was really talking to them. Finally the spirit confesses to have completely lied to me this entire time.

I asked the spirit who he was and he lied to me again and said that he was the ghost of person who once lived at my apartment before me (This place is not very old). Apparently his name was James and he was mad at us for not taking care of the apartment like he wanted and that's why he pranked me.

 I didn't really believe this, especially since it's not like it's hoarders paradise around here. I confronted him about it though and told him that if it was all true, it was wrong to go that far and he should have just came forth and told me who he was. Though I was angry, I tried really hard to stay cool because I heard that sometimes getting mad at a spirit only make things worse. He apologized and I tried to send him on his way to a better place.

After that, I felt horrible over the next few days. I couldn't stop thinking about what happened and I was really confused. Then I came across a video talking about automatic/spirit writing. I decided to try it out to see if it would work and I thought it might be a safer way to get answers. In the video it said that it might take a while to get the hang of automatic writing, but to my surprise, it came naturally to me.

 I tried contacting someone who was a guide of mine to get some answers but I ended up getting tricked again. Shortly after, I started talking to who I thought was my relatives again. For some reason I talked to more of them and I got what I thought was better, clearer answers at first. I was still skeptical though because I had been through so much with James already but I wanted to see if this was all real.

 Eventually after a few weeks of writing, I started to be able to hear them. I could hear what they were going to say even before it was written. I could start to hear full sentences, voice tones, pitches and even multiple people at once. I could even speak to them through my mind. Sometimes if I couldn't hear them, I'd ask a question in my mind and they would write down the answer. I didn't mind it too much at first but then it started to become a lot to handle. I could hear them 24/7 and it became a huge part of my life. 

I think it was cool to hear them but it was overwhelming to hear them so often. I thought it was a 'psychic power' I had that was 'overactive' which made it so I heard them all the time. This went on for a few months and as it continued, I got more and more suspicious but they kept reassuring me that one day they'd be able to prove it to me that it was them. The entire time I felt something was off but I didn't know what it was. I knew James was still hanging around because I could hear him too.

Then in December, my father passed away. Afterward, the voices seemed to stop and it was a great relief. After a while of not having anyone talking to me, I began to suspect that the entire time James was behind it all. I didn't think he could make it sound like I was hearing multiple voices and even different tones but it seems to make the most sense at this point. I can't exactly remember when I came to that conclusion but that conclusion has not changed since.

 Gradually I started to hear voices often again and now I am hearing him 24/7 but it's as himself this time, no one else. Before when I thought I was talking with my relatives, we'd just chit chat all the time even about the most mundane things. Now he just criticizes me and makes snarky comments. This may sound like a joke but he does stuff like this to annoy me: if I even brush my teeth the wrong way he'll make comments. It's really strange but he'll do literally anything in his power to annoy me or even upset me.

Nothing I have done to get rid of him has worked so far. I have tried prayers, that white light trick, sage (even different kinds of sage), I have stopped automatic writing, and even burning the notebook I used to do the writing in. The only thing I haven't done and I'm really kicking myself in the rear for not doing, is burning the Ouija board.

 Back in October, I wanted to get rid of the board really bad. This entire time I have not had a mentor or anything so I have been going by the internet or what I think might help, since I have no prior experience with the spirit world. I thought about burning the board but I heard somewhere that it could actually make the situation worse, so I just gave it up to a place that sells board games. They said they didn't accept Ouija boards because they already had enough of them. However, if you leave something there that wasn't accepted, they will just trash it and that's what I did. So most likely it was trashed but it probably wasn't burned.

I am really desperate for your help. This is not something I can live with for the rest of my life. I wish I knew what to do to make this all go away but I don't. The worst part is that no one knows. I can't tell them about this in fear of people thinking I'm absolutely insane. I appreciate any words of wisdom at this point!"
"Momma Is With Us!","California","Photographs / Videos / EVP","It was the middle of February of 2013. My best friend's mom had passed away in her own bedroom, in her own bed.

 It wasn't but 2 months later I needed a place to stay so I rented the now spare room of my friend's house. After staying over 9 months, my friend had come home with what they call a ""selfie stick"". I had never used one so out of curiosity I mounted my phone to it and held it up and snapped a picture of myself.

 Reviewing it kind of gave me chills and put tears in my eyes to see the silhouette of what resembled my friend's mom next to me leaning her head on my head as though she was including herself in the photo. Without saying a word I showed my friend my first selfie picture.

 Immediately she broke down in tears and called out "" mom!"". ""Its my mom in the picture right next to you!"" It was something that gave the word ""ghost"" a new meaning to me. I never believed in such things until Momma proved it to be real!

 It's amazing because the figures featured resemble the deceased to the way she really looked! After that I had never encountered any more out of the usual sightings or indications that her spirit still had its presence. Momma took a close liking to me and had her own name for me. ""Girl"". Great person and loved by so many. Everybody I shared the photo with definitely say that there is no doubt in their minds that that is a real ghost that took part in the photo. There were questions of, ""is that lingering smoke of some sort?"" And by all means there was no smoke in the room. The camera lens was clean and there weren't any shadows that were casting in such a way to look just the way Momma looked when she passed."
"It Watches Them Every Day From The Upstairs Window","Massachusetts","Haunted Places","On one of the main residential streets in my town, there is a burnt out home which suffered from a fire in June of 2019 which consisted of three ""stacked"" apartment units, one on each floor. No one knows how the fire started, but the home is beyond repair and is likely to be torn down in the next year. The fire was so bad that it nearly caught the neighboring building on fire. Thankfully, no one died but it left three families temporarily homeless. The front of the building is entirely burnt, with all windows boarded up and the roof is completely burnt through in the front of the building. The back of the building consists of three stacked decks overlooking a small parking lot and baseball field, and from the back of the building you cannot tell that there was a fire, as it remains relatively intact. According to town records, the building dates to 1900. 

I have been inside the building one time. When I was at university, the students renting the bottom floor and basement hosted frat parties there. I never thought there was anything ""odd"" about the building other than that it was incredibly run down and the party was evacuated due to a smell of gas in the building which, thankfully, turned out to not be an emergency. I never happened to return. But I pass by the building every night when I go for my walk. 

Yesterday, I went for my evening walk and for the first time, as I passed the building I decided to look at it more closely. In the parking lot behind the building there were, as always, two children around age 10 to 15 kicking around a soccer ball. I waved at them as I passed and looked up at the building. I looked into the darkness of the building inside, but one window behind the second floor deck caught my eye. In the immense darkness was a silhouette of a human looking out at the two children. I could not make out if it was male or female, and I could not see any facial features, just the outline of a person staring out the window in the direction of the children. 

The two children know me and recognize me on my walks each day, so I asked ""Do you see someone in that window up there?"" but by the time they looked up, it was gone. 

""Ah, well. I guess it was my imagination. No one would even be able to get into that building, the doors are completely boarded up. Forget I said anything."" I knew what I saw, but I did not want to scare the children, who lived in the next building over. 

Today, I was intent to capture a photo of the figure in the second floor window. As I passed by the building and waved at the children playing soccer, I nervously looked at the building, but I could not see any figure in the second floor window. After scanning the building with my eyes, right as I was about to give up and chalk it up to my imagination, I finally saw it. This time, the figure was in the third floor window, right in the center of the building looking out at the deck, watching the children, and I was able to deduce that the figure is male. It was wearing what resembled a bowler derby hat, completely dark with no facial features discernible, standing out among the darkness. 

I wracked my brain for an explanation of whether a person could possibly be in that building, and how it could be possible since the ceiling is caved in most of the building, the doors are boarded up, and only the back windows are not boarded up. The upper levels of the deck are not even accessible from the outside of the building, so it is unlikely someone climbed up the deck. 

Could it be a spirit? Why would he be watching the children? Why is he there? 

I wonder if fires and other traumatic events stir up negative energy."
"Historic Seaside Town Haunted House","Massachusetts","Haunted Places","I live and grew up in a famous, historic seaside town. It is beautiful doted with historic sea captain's homes from the 17th and 18th century. I recently bought a home that was built in 1760. It was renovated about two years ago. I am the first to live in the unit that was renovated as we bought it in December of last year.

 My husband and I just recently noticed that we hear loud snoring almost every night coming from our bedroom ceiling around 3 am. We have a woman who lives above us, but she is almost always up at that time as we hear her walking above us, so it is not her who is snoring. It sounds like a man who has a deep snore. It lasts sometimes for 3 hours and seems to stop by 6 am. We never hear it during the day time.

 It is a very distinct snoring sound, which we have no explanation for? We are now convinced it could be a ghost. Has anyone ever heard of something like this? We have ruled out everything? I'll admit, that sometimes I get a bit scared thinking this could be a ghost, but this is the only thing that happens in the house and we truly love living here.

 I also want to mention that we have a tiny dog who sleeps with us and she doesn't snore, so we ruled her out and the woman above us does not have any pets as well. There is an attic apartment where a man lives, but he was away the past few nights for business, so that would also rule him out as we have heard the snoring when he was not there. We are trying very hard to rule out a ghost, but it is increasingly getting harder to do. I would love to hear from any of you who can help us... Many thanks."
"Grandma Sees The Grim Reaper","Florida","Haunted Places","So I have posted a story here recently and I had another more recent one come up into my thoughts. My family seems to be sensitive to the paranormal/spiritual. I cannot say that we all believe but we have all had some kind of odd occurrence happen to us. The original super sensitive person was my grandmother, she had more stories than I could remember. I will be telling of one particular story which happened some time before she passed away. My closest cousin that I talk to everyday was actually a witness to these events as were a couple of other cousins to which I contact directly and have known my whole life.

My grandmother was diagnosed with Lupus which runs in our family. This was around 2010, and the Lupus was pretty advanced because at this time my grandmother was in another country and hadn't been able to get a clear answer of the disease she had. Once she came back to the US it had advanced so far that she went into intense care and pretty intense medicine. This weakened her so much that she was bedridden for all of her last days. 

The family decided to keep her in the hospital for a few months but once we saw she had no chance we decided to care for her at home until the end. During her stay at the hospital is when the weird goings on really got our attention, and they continued on into everyone's homes that she stayed in as we all took turns of caring for her, those are some later stories. In the hospital the nurses would be checking on my grandmother all night and day with various tests and administering various medicines. The problem was that she spoke no English, so my family members would take turns staying the nights with her when there were no translators around.

The first to stay was my cousin D. He said the hospital looked creepy as it was at night, they would dim most of the hallways lights and it would get very cold in there, and there was no space in the room so you had to sit in a small waiting area outside of her room. From this particular sitting area you had a clear view of my grandmother's room and they would leave the door open so that we could keep watch on her in case she (as mentioned above) needed something and couldn't speak English. On this night D said he felt uneasy because my grandmother kept moving as if she was in pain or uncomfortable but when he'd go over to check on her she was sound asleep, so he put it off as tossing and turning in her sleep. This sounded like a plausible explanation until she also started sitting up and talking at random, waking up as the night grew later. 

D would go over and ask if she was okay to check if she was actually awake and not having some kind of episodes, she clearly turned to look at him wide awake and said she was okay but just talking to the lady that has been visiting more often than usual. Of course my cousin D gets freaked out and tried to brush it off and helped her lay down and go back outside to the waiting area. To give a bit of perspective the hallway was narrow and it led to a single elevator that took you down to the lobby, they were on the sixth floor, the hallway was also lined with the long 2x4 light fixtures. D said that around 1AM-2AM random light fixtures would flicker on and off in a pattern and it randomly got ice cold. D was totally freaked out and just sat in shock.

D said he looked over to see if he needed to get up to place a cover over my grandma because it was so cold. When he looked over my grandma was sitting up in her bed and talking in a worried voice to a corner in the room which you couldn't see from where he was sitting in the waiting area since the door did not open all the way. He got some courage and stood up to see what was going on, once he walked over my grandma stopped talking but looked very worried and was breathing pretty hard. He looked into the corner she was talking to and it was empty.

 He turned back to my grandmother in disbelief and asked her if she was okay, to see if shes actually awake and responding, as I said we thought she was having little episode of sleep talking and moving. She then grabs his hand and points to the corner behind him and tells him t to worry because shes gone, and she told her she can stay longer to say goodbye. Obviously my cousin D takes his hand back and moves away from the corner of the room.

D then asks my grandmother what shes talking about. My grandmother then said that a tall woman with pale skin and big black eyes that had no pupil, just all black, had appeared in front of her in the corner of the room. She said she had a long white dress and that would hang to the floor but you could not see her feet, we don't know if she was floating. She also mentioned that she was holding a long spear like item in one of her hands and a book in another. My grandmother said the book looked very old and it was only black, no letters or title. This being told my grandmother in Spanish that she was there to take her away and that it was her time, but she let my grandmother stay because she begged to say goodbye to everyone while they were all present, she had 10 children including all of their children.

 D then tells me he couldn't tell what my grandmother was saying but after she explained what she say he did remember and piece together something she said, this is in Spanish. My grandmother said ""Por favor no me llleves, no estoy lista, porfavor, todavia no"", which roughly translates to ""please don't take me, I am not ready yet, please not yet"". This was all he can piece together from the actual conversation my grandma tried to explain he only understood most of the Spanish, he could not speak or write it.

Once D got her back down and to sleep he sat back down and called for another cousin J to come join as he was too scared to be left alone. As J and D stayed the rest of the night, the lights kept flickering and they kept getting cold gusts of air at random throughout the night. On that same night they both saw her get up again and to the same corner point and say in an angry voice "" I told you to go away, I am not coming yet"", since that moment she never mentioned it again, and my cousins proceeded to tell our whole family this who tried to deny it although they experienced far worse growing up at my grandmother house which was insanely active with the paranormal.

What confuses me is, isn't the grim reaper always described as a male with a skeletal face and limbs, this entity was a woman and looked very much almost alive."
"The ""colored Man""","Arizona","Children Who See Spirits","I spent much of my childhood living between U.S. Army bases and Norristown Pennsylvania. It is actually a borough southeast of Philadelphia Pennsylvania. My mother had twelve children, I was number eight. The youngest, a girl was born in June 1970. My Father was reassigned to Germany in December 1969 and my Mother didn't want to move overseas. We lived at her childhood home in Norristown until he returned to the United States three years later.

 My sister was the only baby in a house that was always a full of relatives. I think she was about one year old when she started referring to someone called the ""Colored Man."" She usually saw him in the living room. Sometimes she would say to move so the colored man could get by. No one else ever saw him, we just humored her and moved. 

In August 1972, my Father returned to the states and we joined him once again. We moved to Fort Lee Virginia. 

While my Mother was setting up the new house, she was arranging some family pictures that were tucked away years ago. My baby sister who was now two years old noticed one in particular and asked my Mother, ""Is the colored man tired, that's why he's sleeping?""

The man she was referring to wasn't sleeping, he was my Grandfather, her Father. He had also died in 1961, nine years before her birth. Several times, it was implied that he was the colored man she always referred to but we never had any confirmation one way or the other - until now. It also provided clarification into something she would say at times. Let me explain.

 Prior to his death, my Grandfather suffered two strokes. His last days were spent in sitting in the front room, looking out the window, while his grandchildren were trying to get change for the penny candy store.Sometimes, he would get himself a big jar of ice water. He had to use a walker and would tell us, his grandchildren to get out of his way so he could get by. 

 He was there, she didn't understand why we didn't see him. To her, he was there and used his walker. At least that's what she saw. 

After that, my baby sister didn't mention the colored man again, though the pictures remained in clear view. 

She has never spoken of him again. Something we can't explain is the fact ""colored"" is a term no one used in our family, and we are African American."
"My Cat Is Acting Strange","New York","Haunted Places","I've had my cat since he was a kitten (around 15 years). He's always been a little strange, but he has never acted like this. He was born without front teeth (he had canines, but nothing else), his tongue would always stick out, and he was more likely to act like a dog then a cat.

A few weeks ago however, he started to act strange. I was laying in bed at around 3:30AM, my cat was laying on the floor in the middle of my room just on the edge of being asleep. All of a sudden, my cat jumped to his feet, staring at my door. He stood for several minutes, his ears twitching every which way. Then all of sudden, he whipped around and started ""chasing"" something around the room. He even jumped up onto my bed and ran from the head to the foot, before jumping back down. Then just as quickly as it started, he went back to his spot in the middle of the room and laid down. He did this for almost a week straight, then he didn't come into my room at all.

 I walked downstairs and found him laying on the couch staring at other cat as he laid on the dining room floor seemingly asleep. I came back down the next morning, to find that the cat that was laying in the dining room had passed away in the night. What freaks me out the most, is that my house is over 120 years old, and in an area known for hauntings. My cat stopped ""freaking out"" after my other cat passed away. But just last night, he started doing it again.

I have a few videos, unfortunately, I don't have a video of the first night. The one where he was running all over the room, like he was chasing something. As you all known, I've had other experiences in my home. However, my cat has never really reacted or been involved in any of them. Until now.

 Just last night, as I was calling him into my room, he spun around, stared at the corner of the ceiling, and cowered against the wall. It actually took me several minutes to get him to come away into my room. As I picked him up, I got a really bad feeling. The moment I set my cat down in his place on my bed, he jumped down, and sat staring at my door.

There have also been instances where my cat will act as if he smells something. He'll walk around my room like he's following some sort of a smell.

It's important to note that when I get up to use the bathroom I always find myself checking up and down the hallway. Feeling as though I was about to get hit with something. My eyes have always been drawn to the corner my cat was staring at, and the nearby attic door. I am honestly beginning to think that I might invest in some night vision cameras and post them around my house at night. I'm not sure if this is a good idea. I don't want to make things worse then they already are.

I've also thought of taking a day, and go around to the ""hotspots"" on my property, and recording some videos, just to see what I catch. If I catch anything at all."
"Baby Kicking My Car Seat","Florida","Misc","I have been actively reading everyone's stories here and have decided to submit my own. It's nothing crazy but still really freaked me out and you will see why.

 This happened around May 2016 when I was dating my now wife N. N and I had just finished our dinner/movie date and I had just dropped her off at her house. At the time one of my sisters was still very young and would still use a car seat, and it was still buckled in behind my driver's seat because I forgot to take it out, this is important context. There was always two ways back home for me, I could have taken a road that cuts straight through the town she lived in and ends up taking me very close to home, but this way took about 30 minutes longer than going on the highway (my second option), so I decided this time to take the highway home as it was around 11:30 PM.

 I had a very small Toyota Celica coupe, which if anyone knows has very little leg room in the back and the seats are not too sturdy so you would be able to feel anyone's legs movements if they were sat behind you. I made my way onto the highway with some music playing and there was almost no one on the road. As I was approaching the first exit off of the highway I suddenly feel two very small feet pushing against the back of my driver's seat. I know it felt like small feet kicking my chair because as I mentioned before my little sister would often ride in her seat behind me. As I felt the kicks I started getting very bad goosebumps and I remembered my little sister's car seat was still behind me. I was very freaked out and did not want to look at the rear view mirror because I thought I would see something scary. This went on for about 1 minute tops but it felt like an eternity. I finally came to my senses and got the courage to look behind me through the rear view mirror, nothing was there. I tried to not think about it the rest of the ride home and even sped up a little.

 When I arrived home I went to check the back of my seat and there was two small imprints on the back of my seat. Strangely they did not resemble shoes or feet, rather just indentations. I was super freaked so I threw out my sister's car seat and bought a new one. The car seat was not used or passed down, it was one we bought a while back completely new from the store. I proceeded to text N about what happened and she got completely freaked out (she hates anything paranormal or strange). I had not mentioned it to anyone for a couple of days because I was still so freaked out and in disbelief. A few days pass and I decide to tell my mother what had happened. We are a Spanish family and my mom's side is big on the paranormal and have had their own crazy experiences which I would love to tell later.

 After I told my mother what happened she looked at me with a weird look and said maybe it was some sort of sign, she believed me. She then tells me that she also had a weird dream involving a baby. My mother says that in her dream she was watching TV in her room and that a small child with light brown, almost blonde hair, came running into her room and was trying to climb her king bed to lay and watch TV with her. She said the child felt very familiar and she even helped it into the bed with her because she was afraid it would fall off, her bed is sitting pretty high off the ground. She told me the hair and size were the only features she remembers as she never saw the child's face, but she said she knew it was a boy for some reason. We were both a little freaked out since we had these experiences happen within a few days of each other.

 My mother says that within our Spanish culture when you dream of a child, especially multiple family members, it means someone in the family is pregnant. I did not completely believe this but my mother said it happened before within my family in which one of my aunts dreamed about a baby girl multiple times and a few days later one of our family members announced she was pregnant, and a few months later announced it was a girl, just as my aunt had dreamed. 

 I told N about this and again she freaked out and said maybe its true and that someone in my family was pregnant. We brushed it off and did not think about it for some time. This all relates to the baby feet kicking at my car seat and you will see why in the next few sentences. After a few months of this happening N and I found out that she was pregnant. I was 18 at the time and it was a really big shock so I kind of forgot about what had happened before with the weird experiences. We decided to keep the baby and it turns out we were having a boy. When I first heard of my sons gender is when it hit back to the baby kicks and my mothers dream. Even freakier is that my son has nice light brown hair that looks almost blonde when the sun hits it. We haven't talked about this in a long time but I always remember what happened. Has anyone had any experiences like this or was it all just coincidence? I have an open mind, I just never 100% believed in such things but I cannot brush off what happened to me. To this day my now wife N hates when I bring this up because it still freaks her out."
"The Victorian Home Part 3","Ohio","Haunted Places","Sorry if it seems like I am bombarding you guys with my stories, but every time I think that nothing else is going to happen in my house, more and more happens. It seems like it's never ending. It's also nice to be able to share these incidents each time they happen. Though I ""just"" posted part 2 of the incidents in my house, I now have to make a part 3 because even more strange things have happened since.

The first occurrence happened in our kitchen. We were all standing around our counter top having a conversation with each other. Before I go on, I would just like to say, we had previously purchased 4 Alexa devices. One for my room, one for my parents bedroom, one for my dads den and one for the kitchen. Just in case some of you may not know what an Alexa is, it's basically a little speaker/screen which you can ask questions, play music set alarms with, etc. As we were talking in the kitchen, suddenly, the Alexa says ""Alarm set for 3 A.M."" Confused, we just looked at each other. None of us had told her to set any alarms, and definitely not for 3 A.M. In order for her to set an alarm, you would physically have to say ""Alexa, set alarm for 3 A.M."". We never had any of our Alexa devices do this. The fact that it could have said alarm set for any time, yet it had to say 3 A.M, known as ""The witching hour"". We basically just said ""That was weird""... And moved on from it pretty quickly afterwards, though it was peculiar.

About a week after that, yet another strange incident happened. Though I can't remember the exact time, it was pretty late at night, considering I was fast asleep at the time. I was awoken from my sleep, because I felt a feeling like dripping water on my forehead. I got up off of my bed, and went into the bathroom to see what on earth it was. When I looked at my forehead, I was pretty shocked. My forehead had bright red blood on it, which was obviously what was dripping on my head the entire time. I ran into my moms room, and showed her the blood. She said ""What happened?!"" I didn't even know myself what had happened. She figured that I had somehow scratched or cut my head during my sleep. I was immediately confused by that explanation, because the blood had been ""dripping"" onto my forehead. She wiped away the blood, and then realized there was no wound. No cut, no scratch no nothing. There was no wound on my head which the blood could even be coming from. I told her that I wasn't scratched at all, and that I initially thought the blood was dripping onto my forehead. Completely confused, we even went into my room, and looked at the ceiling. I of course wasn't expecting blood to be dripping from the ceiling or anything, but I didn't know where else it would have been coming from. I can't really come up with any good explanations for what on earth happened that night.

I have never actually felt scared in my house, even though there has been so many strange things happen in it. I guess I have never felt anything ""physically"" evil, or at least not any proof of anything evil or malevolent. But something has left marks on my mom more than once during the night. By marks, I mean scratches. A total of now, 5 times. All of the times she was laying down on her bed during the night, usually just watching T.V. They're always 3 scratches. Everyone usually believes that this is a sign of something demonic. I'm not so sure though. She will always jump, and I will be like, ""What?"" and she'll say she feels something burning, and when she looks, there will be 3 scratch marks. The thing is, nobody else in the house has been scratched, only her. Sometimes she'll wake up with the scratches as well. We can't even blame it on something like her scratching herself in her sleep, because she has been awake when the scratches happen, and the scratches are always really far up on her back or arm, places where she wouldn't even be able to physically reach herself. She has once tried to reach up to where the scratches were to see if she could have done it, but she couldn't even reach her hand to where the scratches were.

I am not fully sure what to make of any of this, really. I don't think these things can really be explained, at least not by me. If anyone has had anything similar happen, or has any advice please do let me know. Always happy to hear it!"
"Haunted Schools","Nevada","Haunted Places","I was always sensitive when I was younger. I knew that we were surrounded by spirits and could sense when they were near. My High school was situated near an old one room school house that had been closed for somewhere around 50 years. The stories I was able to gather from the older inhabitants of the town were that there were strange happenings in the school and a small group of the younger students were found dead in the schoolroom one morning when the school marm opened the building for the day. 

Intrigued, I went to investigate. The doors and windows were boarded up after years of vandalism. I heard the giggling of young children from inside this condemned building and then the patter of running feet. 

Shortly after this I began to hear these sounds in the halls of my high school halls when I was alone. There were very few times I felt they were malevolent, but they did keep the malevolent spirits that walked the halls of our school at bay. 

Of course, I have many other stories... The town where I spent most of my youth was filled with many haunted places. What happens in the desert... Stays in the desert.

I lived in a house where we could hear old radio stations playing at odd hours of the night and day, and a young woman with long hair walked the halls of our home. She looked vaguely like my mother who had killed herself when I was 12. She had long brownish hair that she would stand near the heater and brush in the early mornings most days. She would move things around and be a general nuisance, but she never did anything overtly evil or mean."
"Shadow Figure In Dorm Room","Texas","Ouija Board / Seances","To give a little background, I'm originally from Canada, however, I went to a college in Texas for a scholarship. We all know the state of Texas is very religious and I'm not at all (this will play into affect later). 

 A bunch of my teammates and I decided to mess around with a Ouija board. One of the girls said she used to do it all the time and there wasn't any harm in it. So we decided to go to a graveyard that wasn't too far from us (YES, I know... A Ouija board and a graveyard... Excellent choice *sarcasm*). We set everything up - the Ouija board and candles. 

The night was very warm and no wind. We all placed our hands on the planchette and started asking questions. We probably asked about 10 questions and nothing was happening. So one of the girls started saying this is BS and it's all fake etc. As soon as she finished saying that, the board started moving and spelling "" GET OUT"" and suddenly the candles all blew out. I don't think we have all moved as fast as we did that night to get out of there.

2 days after that night, I started waking up around 3 - 3:30 am. When I would wake up, I could see this dark figure in the corner of my dorm room and I would stare at it but it would never move. Then all of a sudden I would have an urge to throw up. This happened for a week straight. I never told anyone about this because I didn't want anyone to worry.

 One night I ended up going to one of the girl's hometown since it was thanksgiving and when I walked into the door I noticed a cross statue (it was beige and made out of ceramic) - I suddenly had an urge to touch it. So I did - mind you, I am a very non religious person and for me to suddenly get an urge to touch a cross is very out of the ordinary. However, once I did that - I felt a million times better... Like a Weight has been lifted off my chest. 

Ever since that day - I have never encountered that shadow figure again. 

Any thoughts as to why it attached itself to me?"
"House After House After House","Pennsylvania","Haunted Places","We've had a history of living in houses with strange occurances. So many that we used to think, was it us or the house? But it's been house after house of supernatural experiences...

I have come to think, for now...it's the houses and not us that are haunted. One reason I believe this is because in 2016 we were seeking help from a team of exorcists, priests and laypeople in that field as we were having a lot of issues with one home. 

 A woman with paranormal abilities we consulted who referred to herself as a ""seer"" told us it was not *us* but the houses... We had been living in a very active house that to this day is difficult for me to talk about and changed me and our family, forever. 

We did move, thankfully, to spiritually safer locations.

More recent houses we lived in did have suspicious activity but I question things, and am so very skeptical. 

From 2017-2019 we lived in a house built in 1901. (You just gotta wonder about all the history these turn of the century beauties witnessed.) Loved the house, but it needed work. 

A month after moving in, my son Tom, who was 13 at the time, had an experience that jarred him. 

He was in middle school, which had an early bus pick up time. The routine was he got up just before 6am. He'd eat, dress, get ready. (Point being, he'd be fully awake.) I'd help him gather his things and I would then go back to bed before I had to start getting his siblings up for the grade school bus. 

As soon as I laid back down, my son came running up the stairs and jumped into bed with me in distress screaming there was a ghost downstairs. My big boy was white and shaking, clearly upset. Hysterical. 

At first I thought he was joking, but the more he went on, I realized he wasn't joking.

He said he went to the living room and saw a shadow man close to 6 feet tall, all in black standing in the middle of the room looking at our record player, which was one of those newer models that are designed to look old. They are brown and boxy with that fake antique look. Anyway the shadow man was looking at it and then eventually walked into the record player and absorbed himself into it and disappeared. It didn't bother or engage Tom, but still, from the trauma of our earlier house that things were very bad with, my son had a panic attack at the mere sight of another possible ghostly form.

Logically, I thought, maybe it was a real man who broke in, and maybe he was hiding near the record player crouched down. 

I went downstairs, turned all the lights on and did a search of the rooms. Nothing. Meanwhile, Tom was literally terrified. I kept saying, are you sure it wasn't your brother... No... Are you sure you didn't imagine it... No... Are you sure you didn't fall asleep and dream it?...no. 

Tom never saw it again but he still feels what he saw was real. 

No one else in the family ever saw anything else while we lived there, although my husband swore he heard voices and footsteps in the hallway on several occasions... I also *think* I heard footsteps coming up the stairs and down the hallway on several occasions but I guess you could say I just didn't want to allow myself to entertain the reality of that. 

I suppose it's a possibility that Tom was having a flashback of sorts or it's also a possibility that something followed us from the previous home or even something that was attached to our then, 1901 home. 

In 2019-currently, we moved again to a rental house built in 1940. It's nice, but it has a lot of stairs. There are a series of cement steps and landings from the street to the house. I didn't want to move there because of the steps. I joked saying there's so many steps it's enough to cause a heart attack. Our landlord half laughed but said, one of his workers/painters when preparing it was walking up and had a heart attack and died inside the doorway at the foot of the staircase Uhhhh! So terrible! 

Because of several obligations, one being my elderly relative is in walking distance a few houses down and in need of constant care, we agreed to move in anyway. 

A few days after we moved, junk mail addressed to the previous owners came. They had an unusual name so I decided to Google them. An article popped up saying the man who lived here died in the home. He was a in his 30s, a father, loved history reenactment with costumes. The pictures in the article showed him standing at the bottom of our staircase. There were costumed hats hanging on the wall behind him in a decorative pattern. I looked at the wall and there were holes there where the hats had been hanging in the picture. That, kind of gave me the willies when I looked at the photos. Just something about it, gave me a connection to the person and I felt like I could sense him.

The next day, kids at school. I'm home alone and I see a ball explosion of blindingly white light in the spot at the bottom of the steps. I just stared at it and thought, hmmm, did I just see that? Oddly, it was right at the same spot that I saw the previous owner standing in the photographs. I'd say it lasted a full 5 seconds. 

Over the next few days, early mornings, I'd see a smaller, quicker, 2-3 second version of the same thing. A flash of white light in the same spot, but smaller and fainter...

After the first month, I haven't seen it again. 

I think, is there a plausible explanation? Could it be an electrical issue? But there are no outlets in that location. I'm looking for plausible other possibilities. If it was something, was it the man who had lived there... Or the worker who died in the home?

One of my daughters, Sylvie, was very affected by spiritual activity in previous houses. In one home, there was a *thing* in her closet. A shadow man. That experience has traumatized her to this day. So, the topic is very sensitive to her. 

She came to me recently and said that she thinks this house has something in it. I try to reassure her with logical things she is experiencing. I'm still unsure if she is imagining things, still traumatized by earlier experiences. We have talks often of how much the shadow man has affected her. For her. It's on a level of terror that we have seen therapists. So, it's really hard for me to discern if it could be happening again or just a replay in her mind of the prior past incidents. 

Mostly, she says with this house, *it* is in the basement. 

Her chore, which she really loves, is laundry. She loves to wash and fold everyone's laundry and finds it relaxing with the clean, fresh, lavender oil scents. So, she will go alone to the laundry room in the basement. Here, she says something touches her from behind, touches her hair and shoulders. She does not like it or find it cool. It bothers her. She says doors open down there and she hears footsteps. 

I tell her to pay it no mind, but that's more out of reassurance. I'm not sure if it's real or not... I guess I don't want to believe it. Could she be re-imagining it from prior trauma she experienced? We talk openly about it and mostly I just want to think that no matter what, I'll protect her and she will be ok. 

I'd like to hear theories."
"Why Do I Seem To Be A Magnet For These Experiences?","Alabama","Haunted Places","Sorry I've been gone so long. I do not recall if I ever told anyone I lost my mother in 2016. The day after Valentines 😭.

Shortly after she passed, my boyfriend and I split up for a few weeks and I ended up moving into her home. The same home I lived in when my grandfather passed. I don't know what it is about me that attracted spiritual happenings but I seem to be a magnet.

As soon as I moved back in, lights would turn off in rooms when I purposefully left them on, sinks would sound like they turned on but be dry, footsteps at all hours, rooms would look and feel dingy like smoke had filled the room, among other things.

My mother was cremated and was scattered to her wishes so I'm not sure why it would have been her. However the lights turning off in rooms when I would be out for any length of time is totally my mother's habit.

I have since moved into a new home after my boyfriend and I got back together and this one is just as bad. Our hallway has a door on it and I refuse to go into the hallway without every light being on. Feels like I'm being watched. Feels dense in the whole place and appliances are falling apart before their time.

 For example, we bought an Air conditioner last year and it was fine. We unplugged it and did not use it again until this past April. It sparked as soon as it plugged in and did not work again. On the plug that has never had a single issue until then. In fact a phone charger is plugged in it now and it's working flawlessly. One Air conditioner had to be taken completely apart to find the bearing had been removed and was just laying in the bottom when neither of us took it apart other than to find out what happened. I would chalk the appliances up to defect but why is it that one plug hasn't sparked on anything else and the air conditioner was fine until the following summer? Then there's the classic things disappear and wind up in weird spots. 

My Boyfriend has a habit of hanging his keys up. One day they go missing only to wind up in the front room. Through the hallway I cannot stand. My jewelry will go missing only to wind up in the living room in the middle of the floor. Have dishes just disappear out of the cabinet never to be seen again or wind up in the freezer or in cabinets across the room.

Why do I attract this activity so highly?"
"Hawaiian Ghosts In Military Housing","Hawaii","Haunted Places","My wife and I spent five years in Hawaii while I served in the armed forces. We lived in the officers' quarters and shared a tenement-style four-plex building with three other military families. The apartments had two stories, two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a kitchen and utility room, living room and dining area. We each also had a covered front and back porch.

 We had learned that our apartment was sited over an ancient Hawaiian village and that the area had a history of being a site that Hawaiians had used for centuries.

 We lived in our unit for about a year before sharing the strange occurrences happening in our house with our neighbors. Apparently, the other families had also been experiencing paranormal phenomena but we did not share our experiences until one night while we were all gathered on the front lawn talking over some beers. It was then that we learned of the strange experiences involving our neighbors.

 As for me and Kathleen, we had the mildest occurrences of them all. These included electrical appliances and lights turning on and off mysteriously and drawers sliding open and close at night. I even experienced a light ""slap"" on my rump one day as I was lying down to take a nap.

 Our next-door neighbors were subjected to weekly visits by a strange force that would often come into their bedroom at night while they were both lying there. It would then ""sit"" on the edge of the bed next to the headboard. The bed mattress would collapse from the weight as if some invisible person had just sat down.

 One day, my neighbor's wife had just cleaned her children's upstairs bedroom by putting away their toys and had gone downstairs when she heard her kids playing around upstairs again. When she went up to scold them for leaving out their toys, she noticed that no one was in the room but the toys had been scattered across the floor again and the fans had all been turned back on. She later learned that her kids were at a friend's house across the neighborhood and had been there all day.

 Two doors down, those residents would often hear strange voices. These voices were not audible enough to make out words, but there was enough noise to discern two people having a conversation.

 One day my wife and the wife next door were drinking coffee on the front porch. Both could clearly hear talking in the kitchen the next unit down but paid it no mind. Several minutes later, the resident's real wife drove up and walked towards her kitchen door house. Both Kathleen and her neighbor told her that they thought that she was already home because they could hear talking in the kitchen. After convincing my wife that no one had been home for the last three days, she relented and confessed that the disembodied voices had been heard in their home ever since they had moved in. She said that they never threatened her or her husband but that they unnerved her enough that she would not stay in the house alone. Whenever her husband left for a few days, she would always stay with a friend.

 The most remarkable occurrence at our place happened on the last day that we stayed in the house. It was as if the paranormal forces in the house were bidding us a last good-bye. Kathleen and I had already shipped our furniture to our next duty station and we were living in a hotel waiting for the Army to out-process me from the post. It is required that before the Army let\'s you go to your next duty station, you have to clean your apartment and pass a housing inspection before the next family moves in. 

 Kathleen and I secured a load of cleaning equipment and a small step-stool and arrived at our house at three o'clock in the morning. Since the inspection was slated for eight o'clock, we figured that five hours of cleaning would be sufficient for passing the inspection. We brought the step-ladder so that we could clean above all the light fixtures and curtains as the inspectors were notorious for inspecting those places for dust build-up.

 When we arrived at the house, our other three neighbors had already left for their next duty stations, and as there were currently no occupants living in the tenement, all of the lights had been turned off as well as the nearby street lamp. After fumbling around in the dark, we were finally able to enter the house and begin our cleaning. I began in the kitchen and the downstairs bathroom. Kathleen moved into the dining room and living room area. 

 After thoroughly cleaning the kitchen and bathroom, I called out to Kathleen to inquire if she was finished with the step ladder. I knew she had it, because whenever it was opened or closed, it would make a peculiar ""screeching"" sound. I could also hear her above me in the bedroom moving the ladder around on the ceiling above as she moved around the room to clean above the fixtures. She called back that she did not have the ladder and that she thought that I had it. I was momentarily perplexed because I heard her calling from the living room. When I went into the living room to investigate, I saw her cleaning the floorboards next to the wall.

 ""I thought I heard you upstairs cleaning the bedroom,"" I said.

 ""No, I haven't been upstairs yet. I'm only just finishing the living room. I was just about to ask you for the step ladder. I thought it was you who was upstairs""

 ""Who's upstairs, then?"" I asked.

 She gave me a blank look, so both of us walked upstairs to see who was making the noise. When we got into the bedroom that was just above the downstairs bathroom, we noticed that the light was on and that the step stool was in the middle of the room. Kathleen and I exchanged puzzled stares, shrugged and retrieved the ladder.

 We passed the inspection with flying colors. By the way, the upstairs bedroom in which the ladder had been found was the only room that did not have any dust above the fixtures."
"A Surprise Call","California","Family / Friends Visits","I got a call from my dad telling me my grandfather was in the hospital up north and was not doing well. They were going to cut off his leg to try to save him, but it did not look hopeful. They didn't want me to come see him, and I couldn't talk to him so I sadly expected a call soon informing me that it was over.

 I got a call, but it was my grandfather! He sounded chipper and upbeat, and I got to tell him my expected son was going to be named _____ (the same as him, my father, and me.) He said ""well, that's a good name"" and then he wanted directions to my house. I'm just realizing as I'm writing this that as I was giving him directions I was visualizing the trip from above as if flying over. I remember asking if he was going to visit, and he said if he got the chance he would come by. After the call I felt relieved that he was doing better and was even making plans to travel.

 Then I got the call from my dad telling me my grandfather had passed. I told him we had just talked and that he had sounded so much better, but he said that happens sometimes right before someone passes. I was very sad, but found some comfort in the fact that I was able to tell him about naming my expected son.

 At the wake I was speaking about the day he passed, and how he had called me that afternoon and sounded so much better, but someone pulled me aside and told me to stop talking about it, and that my grandfather had actually passed in the morning.

 He loved to break the rules. I sure miss him."
"The Victorian Home Part 2","Ohio","Haunted Places","For those of you who read my previous experiences in my Victorian home, this is a continual to that. I have had more experiences since then that I would like to share. 

This was one of our most recent experiences. I, and my family were removing a large tree that was growing up our fence. My mom was taking pictures of us and the tree so that we would have memories of it, of course. That night, my mom was looking through the pictures in her Ipad that she had taken of the tree. The tree was sitting in the middle of the driveway, above, there is a window that looks directly out at the driveway. After looking at the picture for awhile, she said to me ""Come here for a second"". She showed me the picture, and zoomed in on the window above, which I never would have noticed. She asked me, ""What do you see in this photo""? I looked at the window for a moment, then, it came to my attention that it looked like 4 VERY detailed faces in our window, that just seemed to be glaring out. I'm going to be honest, though I'm not usually very easily creeped out about the things that happen in my home, usually just curious, this really creeped me out.

 It wasn't really the thought of 4 people being in our window, it was more the expressions on their faces. 1 had a face that looked exactly like a sad clown, the 2nd one had it's mouth open in a wide, almost screaming position, The 3rd wasn't as detailed as the rest, but you could see half of a face with 1 eye visible, the 4th was above all the rest, almost like it was just standing over them, and I swear it looked just like a little boy with bangs. We immediately went over to the window where they were seen, which was in my moms small closet, and tried our best to debunk the situation. There was nothing on the window that could make it looks like there were ""detailed"" faces in the window. We even tried to come to the conclusion that it was a reflection, and tried to take a picture that looked like that one again. No such luck.

This next occurrence is something that only happened to ""me"", personally. 

I was standing in our dining room, right beside the door that leads directly into our backyard. Suddenly, out of nowhere, I smelled very strong cigarette smoke. Just to make things clear, absolutely no one in my family smokes. Cigarette smoke has never been a smell that I enjoyed, so I knew it immediately. The smell seemed like it was very close to me, almost right beside me. I looked around to see if there was any explanation at all for the smell. There was nothing that could have caused it. Then, just as soon as it had come, the smell just disappeared. I found it really strange, but I didn't bring it up until the end of the day, when I was with my mom. I told her exactly what happened. She was really uneasy about it, probably even more than me. She brought up how her dad was a very heavy smoker. He sadly passed away when my mom was only 16. Maybe it really was him that I had smelled earlier that day? I did look up why I would smell cigarette smoke. I found what is known as ""phantom smells"". The thing is, I don't have any kind of infections, and phantom smells happen more than once, but this was the first time that I ever experienced this. Plus, it never happened again afterward.

This was an event that happened awhile back.

My dad was heading into the bathroom to take a shower. As he was showering, he heard a loud, scratching noise coming directly from the attic door. Our attic is exactly above our shower. He stopped the shower, and got out. He called my mom to come into the bathroom. When he first told her what he heard, she thought that he was only messing with her, and she didn't believe him. They both waited for a good 5 minutes, and then, sure enough, the scratching came back. Just in case it was an animal, we didn't go into the attic until the scratching was gone. The next day, both my mom and dad headed the attic to see if there was any scratch marks, which would make us come to the conclusion that it was an animal. But... There was absolutely no scratch marks. No feces, marks, or really any sign at all of an animal being in the attic. If it HAD indeed been an animal, as hard as it was scratching, I can almost guarantee you there would have been scratch marks. 

This next phenomenon is something that happens to me on and off. I didn't really go into detail about it in the last post, but just said that ""I would hear a thump under my bed"". 

At night, I will hear large knocks underneath my bed. It never happens at a certain time, just only at night. When I say ""large"" knocks, I mean knocks that actually move my bed. When they happen, my bed will shake. They will always stop for a little, and then just start knocking continuously. Sometimes more than other times. I have actually gotten so fed up with it at night, that I just end up sleeping on my mom's chair in her room. In the morning, she always asks me why I came in, but I usually just make up something. They don't really scare me, but it gets annoying when something is constantly shaking your bed when your trying to sleep. I always look under my bed to see what on earth could be shaking it like that, but there's never anything. Recently, it has stopped, but I know it will come back again.

This is the last event that has occurred. 

I was sitting on my bed watching tv. I was very relaxed, and wasn't expecting anything to happen at all. My parents, as well as my sister were all asleep. Then, to my surprise, I heard what definitely sounded like a women sighing, very loudly, and extremely close to my face. It really startled me! I flew up immediately, and left the room. 

I do believe that all of this was paranormal. I at least, couldn't come up with actual logical explanations for the following incidents. I'm always happy to share, and hear your guys opinions on our experiences. If I have anymore events, I will definitely share.

Sincerely,

JB"
"Hospital Overnight","Montana","Haunted Places","I have thought about this story a lot lately. It might explain something. I decided I needed to do this one first instead of going back to my haunted Louisiana home. It goes back to my youngest daughter who I refer to as Jacey in my stories. Jacey is now 17 and she and I have talked recently about what she saw when she was younger and how she still sees things. She told me she has just gotten really good at ignoring them mostly, but I know the ones she saw in her elementary days at school still bother her as she talks about them the most. I don't normally see things, but I think of myself as much more auditory because I hear talking a lot and can often carry on a conversation with some, and if possible able to feel a presence so to speak. To keep this from happening, I almost always have noise on if I am alone. I will have a radio going or I will sing loudly myself or talk out loud to myself. 

Here's the story: When I delivered Jacey, she was the second baby. My husband couldn't stay with me in the hospital as we had another child at home. It was the second night in the hospital. I had to stay because Jacey had some problems at birth and she was a cesarean delivery. I remember hearing voices down the hall and I was ticked. I was exhausted. My door to the hallway was open. I wanted the door closed and I just wanted to sleep. Jacey was also in the NICU so I wasn't going to see her all night. When she was born, she wasn't breathing. The doctors don't know why. One doctor argued she was premature even though she was 41 weeks. Another one said collapsed lung and another said it was pneumonia. However, as soon as they'd rub her back or feet she responded and was breathing. They stuck her in NICU to treat for collapsed lung and pneumonia since they couldn't agree why she wasn't breathing. 

Getting out of bed was painful, but I got out of bed and hobbled to my door. I planned to give a ""stink eye"" to the people talking loudly down the hallway. I knew another woman had delivered and her room was just one down from mine. She had the noisy family who had been in and out all day long and it was coming from her side. Part of cesarean recovery is walking and I had made a few good rounds that day, had seen her baby in her room, and had even hobbled by her family on one round. I made it to the door, looked down the hall, and it was empty. As soon as I had stuck my head out the noise abruptly stopped like a radio being turned off. I had heard voices and laughing all the way to that door. I checked the other way. Nothing. It was eerily silent, no noise from the nurses station either. It was like the place was deserted. The noise had stopped as soon as I looked in that hallway. 

I closed my door except for a small crack and got back in the bed and started to close my eyes, when a nurse came rushing in the room and went right in the bathroom. She didn't say anything to me. She didn't even look at me, she just went into bathroom. She didn't even turn the light on. I sat there for a moment, then looked at my door. My door hadn't moved. It was still only open a crack. There was no noise coming from the bathroom. I stared at the open bathroom door. That's when I realized I suddenly had 2 new visitors. There was a nurse and a clergy man of some kind and they were whispering at the end of my bed but I couldn't hear them. At this point I realized their clothes were not right. The nurse outfit looked very old. It was a very starched looking nurses suit and she even had the little hat on. I sat in my bed and watched them. I wasn't scared, I was more irritated with them because they kept looking at me and then would whisper to each other. Finally, I spoke to them and said, ""What are you talking about? Are you talking about me? What?"" That's when I finally did get a scare. They had stopped talking to seem to listen to what I said, and from behind me something shouted a word. I am still not sure what the word was, but it sounded like drugs. It was a very odd voice, it was pretty loud, and it startled me as it came from behind me. I fully expected someone in my room. I twisted so fast and sharply, and that was not good because I hurt myself and felt a pulling sensation on my stitches. Nothing was there because obviously the bed is against the wall. I considered ringing the nurses, but what was I going to say? ""Hi there's 4 ghosts in here, can you get them out so I can sleep?"" At that point, I was more worried I had ripped my stitches open because I hurt really badly. Nothing was behind me, my 2 visitors had left, and as far as I knew the nurse was still in the bathroom. I checked my stitches and they were fine, and feeling that my room was empty I finally got to sleep for a while. 

I really can't explain what happened that night. I didn't really process it until the next day and I hesitantly told my husband about it. He knows I have dealt with this type of stuff in the past. He told me he wishes he was there because he likes to think he keeps things away. Sometimes I think he might too. I was glad to get out of the hospital and go home. Again, it wasn't really a scary situation except for the one who spoke behind me. However, I don't want to have to stay overnight in a hospital again. I had to stay over with my oldest child once, but it was a different hospital and other than a few vanishing not fully formed figures that hospital was pretty quiet. I am a little worried because I have a procedure coming up that I am supposed to stay overnight for. I have convinced the doctor to let me go home the same day and I am hoping it stays that way because I don't want to deal with whatever might be in that hospital."
"They Heard My Words","Connecticut","Psychic / Medium","I will start by saying that I am a pagan priestess. I don't want to say which set of God's and Goddesses I worship as it is not important. I will say that I practice witchcraft regularly, I also teach both the history of paganism and basically every aspect of paganism and witchcraft. I humbly serve my Gods, Goddesses, the spirits. That is important to my experiences. Since beginning my journey as a pagan and now a priestess, I have had far too many 'coincidences' to pretend the gods and spirits do not hear and work with me. 

I will share a few experiences/coincidences with you now.

So when I first moved into my condo, I was overjoyed to find out the people on the other side of my condo also practiced witchcraft. Although, I think they were dangerously uneducated and practiced rites and rituals they were neither qualified or educated enough to perform which I believe contributed to a few paranormal mishaps that otherwise could have been avoided.

What I'm about to share was the start of my lifelong journey. I was maybe 9 years old and my parents were semi-religious and worshiped a Christian God. My mom was the religious one and my dad just kind of went along with it, but I was always interested in paganism, witchcraft and finding the truth. I was reading a lot about the work that Aleister Crowley performed and little 9 year old me decided I would wait until everyone in the house was asleep and try it. It was a one night ritual and included an invocation of a certain spirit. I had never practiced any form of witchcraft before and took it very seriously. I basically did a invocation and petition ritual. I said ""show me your strength, show me your true, and I will serve you. I will follow you."" I ended it with ""show me your words are true. Show me that you hear my words.""

Exactly three days later, my mom and dad had a bonfire at my house. My dad was a tattoo artist and used to have big bonfires and do tattoos out of his studio downstairs. He had some big black man named Vincent who happened to be a spiritualist, and a priestess of hoodoo come to get a tattoo. 

I was sitting outside on the front steps of my house by myself just kind of hiding from the adults. This man, Vincent, who I have never met before came and sat next to me. I looked at him and I swear, he had a presence about him. Vincent gently grabbed my hand and lightly squeezed it with two hands, he looked me dead in the eyes and said ""sister, we heard your words."" I was stunned. I didn't tell ANYBODY about the ritual I had done and certainly didn't want anyone finding out at that point. I just stood up and looked at him. He stood next to me and said that the night before he had a very vivid dream and it was a young girl with red hair (I have red hair) with her back turned to him. In the dream, I was underneath a large tree. He said that he went to walk towards me to talk but once he got closer, he saw that I was talking to an old man with one eye. As he was approaching us, the old man said ""I hear your words and I am with you"". He said he then suddenly woke up.

I was so incredibly excited to hear this but also scared. He said that he wasn't going to come to my father's house but last minute decided to come and he now sees why he was meant to come. He said as he looked out my front door, he saw me from the back as I was sitting on the steps of my house. He said that he knew it was me in his dream and that he was meant to be there at that moment.

That was the start of a very beautiful and powerful journey. I have had many other experiences that I hope to share soon but this was the very beginning for me. A life changing moment."
"Something I Never Expected","Kentucky","Orbs / Lights / Mists","You read stories and watch interviews of people who see things and feel things of a paranormal nature. You don't think it will happen to you, or at least I didn't. 

In my previous submission, I discussed an encounter I had in my grandparents home. I just wanted to make it clear that this encounter was in my own home, just recently. It had such a profound impact on me that I felt the need to share it before I submitted anything else. 

It was a week night and, as usual, my husband and I had settled into our bed to watch some television. Everything was seemingly normal, I hadn't had any weird feelings or anything that day or in the days prior. Our TV is directly in front of our bed, and we had been there watching it for about an hour when this happened. 

To the (my) left of the TV, I suddenly saw a ball of light. It looked like it came out of the ceiling. It came down, went to the right and hovered very slowly across the top of the TV before disappearing into the wall. While I was watching this light, it seemed as if time slowed down. It felt like it was there for a long time, but it had only been a few seconds. I knew this because of the commercial that was playing at the time. 

While watching this light and experiencing time slow, my feet started tingling. This tingling sensation felt more like a vibrational hum that started in my feet and moved all the way up my body to the top of my head. This humming feeling started leaving my head and traveling back down body and ended at my feet, just as it began. 

I believe that this was paranormal in nature, but I have no explanation for it. I asked my husband immediately after I felt like I had control over my body if he seen the light or felt the humming. He did not. 

If anyone has any insight on what this could have been or why only I seen it, I would love to discuss."
"Grave Yard Ghost","Pennsylvania","Haunted Places","This happened to me a couple months ago. I was with my friend and at around 10 o'clock her step mom asked if we wanted to go to a grave yard. We said yes, and got in the car. We drove past a couple of grave yards before going to one a couple miles a way. Once we got close to the grave yard, we noticed we were being followed by a car. We decided to do drive around the block to see if we could lose the car. After awhile the car disappeared, and We went back to the grave yard and pulled in. We got out and noticed a fresh grave. After being there for about 5 minutes we saw something up on the hill and decided to leave.

We got in the car we were about to turn out of the grave yard. We then heard what sounded like a chain saw, and the car stopped. On the touch screen in the car a message started flashing. It said something like ""power connection failure."" My friends step mom had just got the car, and it was brand new. She tried changing the song and putting it in park, but the car wouldn't start or stop. After a couple more seconds the car started again. We left quickly and we were all freaked out. It was now like 12 o'clock. 

When we got back to her house we decided to use her spirit board. Nothing happened until the planchet spelled out ""grave yard"". We then said goodbye and were very freaked out. We still don't know if the car thing was related to the grave yard or if it was just a malfunction. We were still freaked out. I think the car incident was paranormal and I think it has to do with the fresh grave. But what do you think? Just thinking about it and writing this makes me feel the negative energy. I need help. Please help me get an understanding of what happened."
"Edmonds Haunted Rental Home","Washington","Haunted Places","In 2007, our family moved into a small rental home in Edmonds, WA. It was in a 4-plex building, and we rented the upper right, top unit. The rental had 2 bedrooms/1 bathroom, and was approximately 750 sq ft. It was a very small place for our family of 4 - Me, my husband, our 7 year old son, and our 2 month old son. We let our 7 year old have his own bedroom, and kept our 2 month old son in a crib in our room. Immediately after moving in, I had the feeling of being constantly watched... Especially when I was in the shower. It literally felt like someone was standing in the shower with me, watching me bathe. It freaked me out so bad sometimes, that I would cut my showers short. 

The small hallway area in the rental had an access panel for the attic, and I always got bad vibes from it. One evening, I was putting laundry into the stack-able washer/dryer, which was located in a closet in the hallway (right below the attic access), when I saw a dark shadow moving across the wall from our living room towards the hallway. It was the perfect outline of a man, so I assumed my husband was walking over to tell me something... I turned around to see what he needed, and no one was there. I then quickly looked around the wall, out into the kitchen/living room area, and found my husband seated at our computer desk, using the computer. I asked him if he had just gotten up to come over to tell me something, and he looked at me like I was crazy and said, ""No...I've been sitting here the whole time"". 

As my youngest son grew, we graduated him to a toddler bed, and he began waking up from naps, screaming at the top of his lungs. I figured he was just having bad dreams, but there were a few times he would say ""Oww!"" and would pull up his shirt, where there were red, raised scratches on his back. I also found scratches on his arms and legs. They looked like cat scratches, and were definitely not made by my son, whose fingernails I always kept shortly clipped. One day, my son woke up screaming as though he was dying. I went running into the bedroom, and found him on the floor, next to his bed. When I asked him what happened, he told me his bed lifted up and then turned sideways quickly, so that he was thrown out of the bed. He said he knew someone ""bad"" had done that to him, which made me very concerned... My husband and I never talked about anything paranormal around the kids, as we weren't ready to accept that as truth yet.

 My older son was so scared of the hallway at night, that he refused to use the bathroom. He would pee in his garbage can instead - which I was NOT happy about. We even tried putting a night light in the living room, to shine light into the hallway, but I would often find that the light wasn't working when I went to use the bathroom at night. 

One day I returned from the grocery store, and I unlocked our front door so that I could throw my purse, and a couple bags, inside the house real quick. My youngest was still sleeping in his car seat in our vehicle, which was parked right in front of our living room window - even though it was a ""top unit"", we were at street level, with the lower unit being like a daylight basement. I had thrown my purse and a couple of bags down, and went back out to the car to grab a few more bags of groceries. When I came back inside, the hallway light was turned on. And I had gone nowhere near the hallway when I had first entered! I freaked out, thinking someone was in the house... Messing with me. I called my husband, who was at work, and he stayed on the phone with me while I searched the house and the bedrooms. I had the most terrified feeling, and just KNEW that something was not right.

My step-daughter came over to stay the night, one weekend. She was about 13 years old, at that time, and she slept on the top bunk in our oldest son's room. That night, I was woken up in the early morning hours, by the sound of footsteps walking back and forth across our ceiling. I tried to imagine what it could be... The roof was pitched, so there was no way someone could be walking so steadily, back and forth across our roof. No animals could make solid footstep sounds like that. I could even hear the footsteps walking right above our bed, and then out from our room into the rest of the house! I was very scared, but tried to think there must be a reasonable explanation for it. Eventually the footsteps stopped, after about an hour or so, and I fell back asleep. In the morning, I asked my step-daughter how she slept, to which she replied, ""Crappy"". I told her that I ""didn't sleep well either because I kept hearing""... And then I hesitated telling her about the footsteps, not wanting to scare her... To which she then replied, ""Footsteps on the ceiling?"" I was shocked she had heard them too! I asked her more about it, and she explained that she heard them going back and forth across all the ceilings in the house for quite a while. She also told me she heard someone whisper her name, which had really scared her. 

The final straw was when my husband and I finally had a conversation about the fact something paranormal was happening in the house... He was a definite non-believer. We were talking about it, in our living room, when the sound machine that we used for our son during his naps, suddenly turned on. It was blaring music loudly, as it had a radio function also (that we never used). We both got up to walk into our room to see why it was on, and when my husband stepped in the room, it turned off. He turned around and looked at me strangely, and then went to walk toward it again... To which the radio turned back on! He stopped abruptly, looked at me, and then went to go to the radio again... And it turned back off! We both ran out of the room, totally freaked out. After a while, we went back into the room and found that the sound machine was actually unplugged from the wall! 

Our family moved out fairly quickly, after that, and my step-daughter and I had a bit of a seance before we left... Where we told the spirit it could not follow us to where we were moving, and that it needed to ""go to the light"". We had lived there for 4 years, by that time. The next house we moved into still had bad vibes, in certain areas, but we did not experience the level of haunting as we did in the Edmonds house. I often wonder if the new tenants experienced anything, after we left."
"Changing The Things I Cannot Accept","Georgia","Haunted Places","Things move around sometimes in a home that has people in it who are experiencing an emotional upheaval. People say that poltergeist activities are usually centered around adolescents. I am turning thirty-nine this year; but that is besides the point. I have an active imagination and I am always at the center of some creative whirlwind, wherever I go. I was also divorced last year after ten fruitless years of marriage. Last year was not my best time.

I had to move back in with my mom and my stepfather. At the time of these ""goings-on"" they lived in Hahira, Georgia. I was upset but I know that I tried very hard to have a good attitude about having to start my life over again - for the fifth time.

It wasn't just me that brought the attitude to the house in Hahira - there was a good amount of it there already. During the time we lived there, every single one of us heard footsteps walking around and a child talking outside the house.

My stepfather, Mark, was the first person to hear the child. Mark smokes cigarettes like nobody's business. Back and forth on the porch out back, all hours of the day and night. He has a herniated disc in his back which facilitates the behavior of being awake all night and all day. He reported hearing a child, who seemed to be trying to get his attention, shortly after midnight. It said:

""Mark! Mark! Mark!"" in an excited whisper. 

He said that the sound was close by his face; but the flood lights illuminated anything nearby and there was nothing to be seen at the time. The porch, he was sitting on, was a concrete square that was attached to the ground. There was no one there but himself. He started smoking on the front porch after that.

To be honest, when he said that, I thought: ""Obviously, he needs a good night's sleep."" I thought this, despite the fact that I was hearing footsteps all the time and my personal items were being moved all over the house. Two times, I had the unique experience of finding all of my socks separated from each other in my drawer. I can be scatterbrained but there's no way that I am the cause of that one.

I changed my mind, about the ""child"", one day when I met a little boy, named Colin, who was coasting around, aimlessly, in our back yard. I got his attention and asked him if he was looking for anything. He said he was looking for a child that lived in my house. I told Colin that no children live in my house - or ever have. It was a new house and my parents were the first people to live there. Colin looked confused. He asked if Mark lived there. I said:

""Sure! Mark lives here but he's 67. Who are you looking for?""

Colin, still confused, did not answer me and ran off. He came back after about two hours and insisted that there was a little boy that lived in my house and this boy told Colin to come back later to play. He was certain that a child, about his own age of 7 or 8, was there, living in my house. He said he saw him that same day.

Well, this mysterious child in my house was the subject of much speculation; but, of course, we never got any answers about that. Colin, I found out, lived nearby; but Mark said he had never seen Colin before. It was very startling that Colin asked for Mark. At that time, I thought that there was a connection between Colin and whatever was pestering Mark outside, while he was smoking. I feel silly about this but, after first meeting Colin, I began to entertain the idea that a ghost ""child"" had told Colin about the people he ""lives with"". In reality, it was probably only like this: Colin knew who Mark was and, since I was a dead-end for his questioning, he wanted to ask Mark about the ""boy who lives with us"".

And poor little Colin never did stop asking about him, as long as we lived there. I asked Colin what the boy's name was but he said:

""I don't know. I didn't ask.""

I may have even had an interaction with this ""child"". The same day that Colin first came looking for ""him"", I was in the backyard. The backyard of this house is huge and open. I was standing somewhere near the middle when a small chunk of concrete came sailing out of empty space and hit me in the collar bone. With my eyes looking along the lines of the possible trajectory, I stooped down and picked up the concrete. I stayed in the yard for half an hour - a half hour that was filled with speculative minutes. No one ever became visible. It didn't matter - there wasn't any way for anyone to be able to hit me with such speed and accuracy from the cover of the woods, four hundred yards away.

Eventually, I stopped wondering about the concrete. Not long after that, something else happened, inside the house, that seemed like it was beyond what I consider to be ""poltergeist activity"".

One day, while my stepfather was at an appointment with his VA doctor, I had, what seemed to me to be, a negative interaction with something:

I was sitting in my room reading my email and I heard footsteps pass in the hall behind me. They went in my mother's room and I heard the light switch go off. I got up and walked to her bedroom door, which was open. There were no lights on; but everything was clearly visible since, as far as I can remember, it was around noon. I saw no one in there but I knew someone went that way and didn't come out. Her closet door was shut and I could see that the light was on. I went to the door and asked:

""Mom? Are you in the closet?""

""No,"" said someone who was most definitely in there. It sounded like her.

I thought to myself: ""What fresh Hell is this?"" I am used to my mother's attitude but this was a new development.

I backed out of her room slowly, down the hall and into the kitchen, where I was able to see out of the window from which you can view a considerable portion of the backyard. She was far out in the backyard pulling up weeds. She was not in the closet.

I asked her, when she came in, if she had somehow heard me ask that question. She didn't know what I was talking about.

I think that was the turning point for me. I decided to stop being a bemused bystander in my own house. There have been many times that I have recommended, on this site in the comments, that people give ""Rook's Cleansing"" a try. That is because I used his method over the course of three days - while my parents were out of town. Never heard a peep after that day."
"The In-between","Michigan","Orbs / Lights / Mists","My story happened recently and it puzzles me. Not sure it's actually paranormal but I will let you decide. 

My bedroom has 2 windows with room darkening curtains. I sleep with a fan set on hurricane speed to drown out any outside noise and my bedroom door was closed. I'm not sure what time this occurred but I woke up and looked toward the window/curtain on the right side of my bed. I saw a bright light about the size of a tennis ball. It wasn't solid but seemed to have texture and a certain glow to it. This light didn't move and I didn't ""feel"" anything negative from it.

 My thought was, it was my ""guardian"" and I'm not sure if I said, ""Thank you"" out loud or thought it. I rolled over facing away from this light and went back to sleep. I didn't wait for it to disappear because I was so tired. 

If it was my ""guardian"", was it checking on me? That was also a thought I had. 

I should also mention my dog was sleeping at the foot of the bed and I don't think he reacted at all. When I woke up later I wondered if I was actually awake when this occurred or was this the in-between. I'm sure some people can relate to the in-between. I don't know what else to call it but it's the place where you're not really asleep but not really awake. I've found I have the most vivid dreams in this state. It's almost like there's more clarity to my thoughts sometimes in this place and I've felt an Out of Body experience. I know it sounds crazy and just maybe I really am dreaming and there is no in-between. I'm open to your opinions, whatever they may be. Thank you for reading!"
"Mysterious Ball Of Light","Kentucky","Orbs / Lights / Mists","Hope this story finds you well. 

I have always been a believer in all things paranormal. I've never been a skeptic, even as a child. My parents have told me stories of me talking about seeing ""angels"" when I was young. I have had my fair share of experiences with the paranormal and I'm excited to share them all with you. However, this one was different and got my attention. 

It actually happened last night. I was finally home after working 12+ hours as a nurse and I was looking forward to relaxing before going to sleep. My spouse and I have been remodeling small sections of our home over the last two weeks and yesterday while I was at work, he started on our bedroom. I was tired and so was he, but we finished laying our floor and rearranging the furniture. Our bedroom was finally complete at around 11:30 pm. 

As I'm finally kicked back in bed watching Hulu, I see this ball of light manifest from my floor and travel up my wall and around my tv, only to disappear into the ceiling. The light was an odd but beautiful color. It was white with bright (almost electric-like) blue. I was stunned as soon as I realized what I had just witnessed. At the same time, I felt my entire body start tingling/vibrating. It started in my feet and crept all the way up to the top of my head. 

I was paralyzed. I could not move. It was as if whatever this ball of light was, was holding me in place. As soon as the light disappeared, my body started getting the tingling/vibrating sensation. I was not afraid, in fact I felt warm. I was confused at what was happening because it was happening so fast. 

After about a minute I was able to move again and the tingling left my body as quickly as it started. That's when it really sank in for me. I think I have seen a spirit manifest itself as a ball of light and somehow I felt it's energy. Does this sound correct? Did I have an actual encounter with a ghost or spirit?"
"Playing Wolf Wolf","Michigan","Haunted Places","When I was young I lived in Michigan where our home was out in the country. The area was corn fields and trees. We had a big family and we got together all the time. One of our favorite games was called wolf wolf. It was played at night. One person would be the wolf. They would go out into the dark and hide. The rest would wait for that person to call wolf wolf and they would head out to find the wolf. Once the wolf was found we would holler wolf and race to the goal. Anyone caught would then be a wolf and it would keep going that way until there was one person left. 

 One night my friends were over from around the block and we decided to play wolf wolf. There were 6 of us playing. I was the start wolf so I went out to hide. It was around 2 AM. My friends came to find me but when they did they did not run so I was wondering what was up. They asked me who the kid was over by the tree. I thought they were playing a game on me and trying to scare me, but they kept asking so I asked where and they proceeded to lead me to the spot. 

Right in front of my grandmother's house there was a cedar tree that was bare of branches 6 to 7 feet off the ground. Sitting at the base of the tree was another kid about our age. He had his back against the tree and his arms around his legs like he was sitting in a fetal position. He had his head down. I said to him ""hey who are you and what are you doing"". He did not answer or look towards us. My friends would not get near him. So I said it again with no answer again. I walked towards him and got to about 5 feet from him. He then looked up at me with big red eyes. I started walking backwards away from him and turned. My friends already bolted back for my house. I then ran after making sure I was not followed. It was the scariest thing I have ever seen in my life.

 My friends were crying when I caught up to them and still had to walk 2 miles home. I begged my father to take them but he would not because he had to get up for work the next day. So I decided that I would walk them home. Keep in mind that this is in Michigan and most of the way was wooded area. When we got them home I then said good night and had to walk back home by myself at 3 AM. The whole way home all I could hear was something walking right behind me. The fear that washed over me was crazy bad. I had all I could do not to bolt and run in terror, but I didn't. I did not want it to think I was afraid. I made it home just fine but since then I have always been aware of the things in the night. Even now that I am older it is still very hard for me to go out into the night alone."
"Disturbed While Sleeping","Virginia","Haunted Places","A few weeks ago I had gone to sleep with my led light on a bright setting. My mom decided that they were too bright and came in my room and changed them without me waking up. I usually sleep with my covers on top of me since I feel uneasy at the closet in my room. I opened my eyes to something laying on top of my stomach. 

Confused I sat up but nothing was there, everything was the same except for my led lights which were dimmed. I checked the time and it was around 11:30pm. I went back to sleep in a daze and confused. When I woke up the next morning, I asked my mom if she had come in my room. To my confusion, she said all she had done was changed my light color. Since my dad wasn't awake yet I waited downstairs. When he finally woke, I asked him the same thing. He said that he hadn't even come near my room. 

After that I was absolutely confused. My parents just laughed my panic off and still do whenever I bring it up. I get a feeling of being watched from my closet whenever I have the cover over my head. When I sit up I still feel a sense of being watched but not as much as before. Whenever I'm doing anything in my room, I have a feeling to look over my shoulder at my closet. 

The more I think about it, I think I might be over thinking although I know what I felt that night. Even now my parents think I'm just playing around when I say that I feel uncomfortable in my own room so I've come here for help. Would burning sage help or is this a bigger situation than just burn sage and you're good?"
"Childhood Fears","Florida","A Haunted Life","I will start this story telling you what happened to me as a kid, teenager and adult.

 When I was 5 years old and living in Tyndall AFB Florida base housing I had a really strange occurrence. I was in bed trying to get to sleep and I had some toys on top of my dresser. I had a stuffed monkey toy sitting on a chair on the side of my bedroom. I was looking at the monkey and I felt really afraid of it for some reason, a reason my 5 year old brain didn't understand. Anyways, I looked away from the monkey toy and I heard a shuffling sound and when I looked back at the monkey toy he was sliding halfway off the chair. It stopped hallway on/off the chair. I looked away again and a minute later I heard another shuffling noise and the monkey toy was completely off the chair and on the floor. I shouted for my parents and I immediately left my room. As I got closer to my room door and my dresser, and as soon as I got close to dresser, all my toys went off simultaneously, lights were flashing and all of the toys were moving around in a circle on top of my dresser. I hightailed it out of my room and went to the living room where my parents were watching TV. My parents didn't believe me when I told them what happened in my room. I don't like any kind of doll toys because of what happened top me when I was 5. I can't stand doll toys!

 Second thing that happened to me when I was 18. I had just joined the Air Force and I went to a hotel party and I got wasted drunk. As I was going back to my dorm room I heard the exorcist girl (from exorcist movie) tell me ""The devil is coming to get you..."" and demonic laughter! I was frozen with fear. I IMMEDIATELY grabbed my bible, turned on all the lights and I slept with that bible the whole night.

Last thing I have had a few times where I felt a presence but I couldn't see anything, I just felt something. I would leave the uncomfortable area/room and the feeling of fear left me. Sometimes I can tell who is going to call me before I get the phone call. Do you guys think I could be psychic? Please don't laugh. The end"
"Evil Spirit Encounter As A Young Teenager","Oklahoma","Haunted Places","I am 62 years old. The events below occurred when I was 12 through 13. The were so dramatic and real that I remember them as if they just occurred.

 My large family was living in a house that was 103 years old at the time. My father was a violent, abusive, psychotic and daily IV drug addict. I had 2 younger brothers and 2 older brothers. The oldest had moved out.

 My bedroom was upstairs and to the right. I tried to be in my room as much as possible to avoid my father's beatings. I read a lot, discovered Tolkien and sci-fi. I had an aquarium, chemistry set and microscope. Probably rather like young Sheldon.

 Anyway, paranormal things started happening right away. I never saw a ghost or spirit but I felt its evil presence. Sometimes I would get up to leave its presence and other times I would just get up to leave the room for school, etc... I would be stopped in my tracks! I literally could not take a step forward. I never felt hands grabbing me and holding me back or standing in front of me pushing me back. What I encountered was like a force field. You could not push against it like a wall and feel it. It was exactly like the sensation of trying to push 2 magnets together. Just no way to progress against it. Instantly it would fill me with such dread and such a strong feeling of absolute evil that it terrified me. This would sometimes last a few seconds and sometimes a few minutes. 

Onetime after getting released by it I started walking down the stairs. About halfway down it floated me down the rest of the stairs and set me down gently. I was shook by that. It was a school day and cereal, bowls and milk were set out on the near end of our long table. I went to reach for a bowl and it scooted 2 feet away from me! I tried again and it did it again. I finally made my cereal. That was the only time that anything manifested outside of my room.

 Within a block of my house on the same side of the street were 3 funeral homes. I have wondered if that was the cause of the problem. Whatever it was was palpably evil; like demonic (whether a religious person or not) strong, negative, hating evil. I was so glad to move away from that house.

 My youngest brother told me that when he was 10 and home sick alone that a 7 foot lizard-man that felt evil manifested in his room. He had waited 50 years to tell me his story for fear of not being believed. I believe him. He is the type that would rather die than tell a lie. I have seen few accounts of this force field type sensation on the popular paranormal shows and give most credence to those stories."
"I Saw A Nun Walking Down The Street","New York","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I've been doing a lot of thinking. I live in New York, and everything is shut down because of the Pandemic. Last night, I remembered something that happened to me when I was really young. Probably about 6 or 7 years old.

I was watching the Memorial Day parade that my town puts on every year. I remember looking around, I had lost track of my Mom and was trying to find them. They ended up being a short distance behind me. Satisfied, I turned back to watch the parade. Only to notice something odd out of the corner of my eye.

There was a Nun walking down the sidewalk, holding the lower corners of her apron. It was clear she was carrying something in her apron. I remember calling out to her, and her walking over to me. I said hi, and asked what she was carrying. She lowered the edge of my apron so I could look.

There laying in her apron, was a tiny baby boy. He looked like he was no more then a day or two old. And he was completely naked. No diaper, nothing.

I asked what his name was, and the nun said that he didn't have one; the Nun smiled at me before walking away.

It's important to note, that my town is nowhere near any sort of orphanage or Nunnery.

It's also important to note, that my town sits on a ton history. But to my knowledge, there has never been a Nunnery, Catholic Church, or Orphanage anywhere near my town.

I never saw anyone or anything like her outside of TV again.

I'm not sure if this was a ghost, or what. But I most certainly can NOT explain it.

Any ideas concerning what I might have experienced would be welcome."
"Dark Entities","Utah","Haunted Places","While my family and I try and find a research team or paranormal medium, this is what's been going on in our house. (Mind you when I was only 3 years old, I started saying what I thought were demons and what looked to be a werewolf creature. My mom had me blessed and they went away for a time.) 

 Things didn't start right away here, but I actually moved upstairs because of a feeling of being closed in on and all I can describe as total paralyzing fear. I won't go in our basement at night anymore. When I would go down the stairs and head to my room, there was an overpowering sense that something was right behind me. I've spent countless nights with a heavy feeling and a feeling of being watched. (Mind you I'm getting up there in years, and I would literally pull my covers over my head). There's a specific corner in the basement that just ""feels"" extremely dark in nature.

 I've gotten spirit box voices before that seemed like gibberish, but I'm not sure. I hear conversations in bedrooms that sound just like my parents, while they're both asleep. I've heard my name multiple times, and went to see what a family member needed, and they didn't call me at all. My step dad has seen apparitions going down to the basement, and my mom feels someone getting in bed with her. We're hoping we can find someone to come investigate this for us, and I'm publishing this to see if anyone can recommend someone. I'm now upstairs close to family and some nights still feel a presence. 

I've seen a dark entity myself in the canning room in the basement. And being empathetic, I can't shake the feeling of dread in our basement. I wonder if this could be native with the history of West Jordan and the tribes the settlers wiped out when construction of the bills and forte were done. I'm open to any suggestions."
"He Died In This House","Kentucky","Haunted Places","Before I get started, I will share some background information. The location where this happened is my grandparents home that they have owned for 20+ years. Many of my relatives have had unexplainable experiences in this house. My grandfather says the man who owned the house previously died in the home as the result of an accident. People, including myself, have heard footsteps, dishes/glass breaking, things falling, etc. 

It's summer time in my small town of Albany, Kentucky and I was about 12 at the time. The county fair was going on, so my parents dropped me off with my friends and my grandparents picked me up later that evening because they lived close to the fairgrounds. I have always been really close with my grandparents and would stay the night with them frequently. 

This night, however, I didn't feel very welcome. I was in the guest bedroom which had been built onto the house some years before that I slept in every time I stayed the night. I had gotten ready to go to sleep, so I had the tv on for light, but I had it muted. After tossing and turning for what felt like an eternity, I was still uncomfortable. I turned the bedside lamp on and finally started drifting too sleep. 

I was barely conscious, in that half awake/half asleep state. Lying on my right side with both my hands slightly tucked underneath the pillow. All of a sudden, I was jolted awake when I felt something/someone grab a section of my hair and pull, hard. Growing up with a mother who fixed my hair every day, I was not tender headed. When I opened my eyes, although I didn't see anything I was understandably terrified. I was frozen with fear. I really could not move for what felt like eternity.

When I finally got the courage, I tore out of the bedroom and ran down the hallway to my grandparents room. I was crying and frantic telling them what happened. My grandfather got up and got his gun, went through the house room by room thinking someone may have broken in. No one was in the house besides us and there were no signs that anyone had gotten in and left. The next morning I had a huge welt in my hairline where my hair had been pulled so hard the night before. 

I have so many other stories to share about this house and other experiences!"
"The Giggling Girls","Ohio","Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels","This is a personal experience that me and my family had in a hotel in Ohio. I was only about 5 years old at this time. When we first arrived at the hotel it seemed nice. It had a giant hallway, a large staircase, decent rooms as well as an indoor pool. I believe it was sometime in the afternoon when we were just sitting in our room. Suddenly, we heard the laughs and giggling of 2 little girls. It sounded like they were out in the hallway.

 My mom, thinking that they must be headed to the pool, said that we should go out and swim so I could have someone to play with. When we left our room, there was no sign of anyone besides us in the hotel. A little confused, we went back to our room. The next day, we were checking out of our room getting ready to leave. My mom said to the lady at the desk ""The little girls upstairs were running through the halls all night"" the lady just looked at her and said, ""no one else is in the rooms upstairs"".

 After that, we were even more confused and didn't know what to think. We clearly heard them, as if they had been inches from our door. My aunt did work there for some time, so after we left we immediately told her our odd story. She seemed pretty surprised, and then she asked, ""You don't know about the stories of the hotel?"" There were rumored to be 2 little girls who died in a fire at that hotel. There were many people that said they could hear the laughter of them still in the halls. After that, we were all completely freaked out. Apparently, the hotel was rumored to be haunted. We had no idea the entire time we were there. This may seem like a pretty cliche story, but it happened to me and I found it very creepy, and it's something I will definitely never forget. I now know there is something at that hotel, and we most definitely never went back after that.

PS: I'm sorry that this was so short, but these are all the details surrounding what happened.

Thank you for taking the time to read it!

Sincerely,

JB"
"I May Be Being Contacted By An Old Friend","New York","Haunted Places","Four years ago my friend died unexpectedly and for a while I sensed a spirit with me and was almost being contacted by him. A couple months after he died I experienced sleep paralysis and lucid dreams involving him and I was in a place very important to him when it happened. I tied these things to him but I wasn't sure. Nothing unusual happened for a while until a few months ago.

 I moved into a new house and a couple months after I did, many things started happening. I often felt a hand on my left shoulder when I'm alone, I have a recorded video of a repeated tapping on the window by my bedside and the window is two floors up and facing the street. I didn't think much of anything until tonight. I've been lighting incense a lot in the past couple days and today it started. My closet door that's shut tight with nobs was found open twice today and later tonight I was in bed watching tv when both of the closet doors were jerked open fast from the inside. I checked everything and it was impossible for both of the doors to open at the same time. Considering that lately I felt as if someone was watching me in my room and I got a sudden chill and cold after I checked the closet I decided to call a friend and she knew what to do.

 I salted all my window panes and put garlic in tied cotton thread. I lit candles and incense as well. While I continued to text my friend, my satellite and wi-fi shut off suddenly. The weather was fine with no rain or wind and everything was off for 15 minutes. I kept trying until I got service back and my friend sent me screenshots of messages saying I blocked her and my calls were blocked too. I explained what happened and I didn't block her.

 All of these things have happened but it's not the first time. A lot of things have happened since my friend died and even before that. If he is trying to contact me are these signs safe? Would I know it's him and it's safe to respond or would it be something else. Nothing dangerous has happened but the signs are strong and impossible to ignore and I don't know if I'm safe to contact his spirit or if I'm being tricked.

 I genuinely want believe it is my friend since the physical contact was not harmful and did not seem wrong but it also feels out of place for a loved one to do this to me after so long. A lot of the same stuff has happened to me in any house I've moved to or visited since he's died so I'm started to believe the houses aren't haunted but rather I am. The feeling of being watched and bothered has also happened in my childhood before my friend died."
"My 1st Experience","New Mexico","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I lived in this small hometown in northwestern New Mexico, where I lived in a house that I rented for a short time. I remember moving in and the landlord never did mention anything happening in this house so I had no idea what I was in for. The first few months living there was quiet and nothing out the ordinary, until one day I started to feel like I wasn't alone. Some friends had come over for a housewarming party. I had never had any feelings of not being alone until some friends had come over this night. I wasn't the one who had the experience this one night though. One person happen to fall asleep on the couch in the living room while everyone else were asleep on the floor and I was in my bedroom. Everyone was sound asleep until this person happen to jump up and yell out "" HELP!"" We all jumped up half asleep trying to figure what had happened... Asking this person what happened and if he was dreaming? Just looking at his face you could tell he wasn't dreaming, as pail and scared as he was.

After he calmed down a little bit we were able to finally hear what he was trying to tell us. He had said that he was sleeping and he could feel someone grab him by his shirt. He thought it was one of us in the house messing with him. He tried telling this person to leave him alone he was sleeping. It didn't stop... He said whoever or whatever it was started to shake him vigorously that he woke up and saw a figure but it had no face, it was just black in the face. When he awoke from being shaken and screamed out for help he said the black figure just faded into the shadows inside the house. We don't know what he saw nor did I ever see this figure while living there. But he said he knows what he saw and swears he wasn't dreaming. I have never seen or experienced anything of any sorts like this before I had any company over. So I don't know if it was because I had people over or not?... He left and never came to visit after this had happened to him..."
"The Victorian Home","Ohio","Haunted Places","I live in a large brick victorian home that was built in the 1800s. I, and my family have had numerous occasions where unexplainable things have happened. Here are my stories.

 I had been in my room all alone, I was very young at this time! I was just standing there in front of my mirror with my fan on full blast. My bed was facing me. When I turned around, a penny spun out from underneath my bed. The penny somehow flew out from underneath the bed, and then just spun in the air for a few seconds as if someone flicked it out from underneath the bed, and then it finally fell on the floor right in front of where I was.

 To this day, I have no idea how that could have happened. I tried to think of every possible explanation there could be, but there just isn't one. When it first happened I never said anything about it, but it did creep me out a lot, and I also had many questions. 

 If someone harmless was just simply letting me know they were there, why would they be under my bed? Should I be scared? Is this a normal thing that ghosts do to get your attention? I would really like some answers.

 That was my first ever creepy experience in my home, and nothing ever happened for years after that. But then my older sister finally experienced something. She had been really sick at the time. She was nauseous with a fever and headache. She was laying down in her bed in her room, which is right across from mine. There is a hallway that separates all the rooms with a large staircase. She is able to see into the bathroom when she is in her bed because it is directly out in the hallway. She had seen my mom doing her makeup in the bathroom mirror, like she always does before doing yard work outside. Then she saw her walk downstairs. She said that she could have swore that my mom had already went downstairs, so confused, she went downstairs and then outside to see my mom. She had only seen her in the bathroom 2 minutes ago, but when she saw my mom outside, my mom was drenched in sweat considering it was almost 90 degrees outside and was continuing cleaning our pool. So she then asked my mom, ""weren't you just in the bathroom?"" My mom had a angry response like, ""does it look like I was in the bathroom?"" ""I'm drenched in sweat"". My mom had been in the same place in my backyard for almost 3 hours, so who exactly was in the bathroom?

 There was also, obviously no possible way that my mom was inside 2 minutes ago, got outside that fast, and was drenched in sweat after just being inside the house. You could definitely see the fear in my sisters face because she went completely pale. Terrified, she told my mom that she had seen an identical image of her in the bathroom. I have heard of ghosts taking the appearance of other people, so was that what happened? We both know that whoever it was, it definitely was not my mom. Apparently though, whatever or whoever it was took the appearance of my mom and I have no idea why.

 So these were 2 unexplainable situations that we again, just forgot about. 

Here's my 3rd experience. My mom and dad have always tended to argue a lot. That day, that's exactly what they were doing. They were in the kitchen arguing away, then suddenly, a glass plate that had been on the same shelf the entire time we've lived in the house came flying off the shelf and busted on the ground in front of my parents. It was definitely the most violent thing that had happened, which was very scary. Now there's 3 very odd things that have already happened. 

A very long time after this with nothing weird happening at all, my mom told me about an experience she encountered in our living room. She said that she saw a little girl while putting up Christmas decorations. She said she was in a white dress with a ribbon in her hair, but she only saw the back of her because she had been running away. Apparently, she seemed very afraid. Now, here is the story that scares me the most.

 Almost 5 years ago now, my dad suffered a massive stroke before leaving for work. He was downstairs getting ready to leave, doing his usual things such as letting our dogs out and getting his coffee. After he got out of the hospital, he told us that when he was letting the dogs out before the stroke he thought my mom was hugging him from behind. But my mom had been upstairs the entire time. When we were in the hospital they said that my dad was very healthy, and that he was almost as healthy as a 20 year old. They also couldn't find anything that could have caused his stroke. Which to me at least, was rather odd. Especially since he thought he saw my mom before his stroke happened.

 I definitely feel as if their is something in my house, and I have no idea whether it's something good or bad. I never feel safe in my room at night and constantly feel like something is looking at me. I usually just brush it off thinking I'm paranoid, which I probably am. But I definitely think I have every right to be. My room lights have also always flickered, and there have been times when I hear a thump under my bed or creaking noises on my floor when nobody is in my room, and my cat is laying sound asleep on my bed. Speaking of my cat, he also always acts like he sees things. He will constantly just stare at different areas of my room, and when I look to see what he's looking at there is never anything there. On a few occasions, he has even been so intent on getting something that he has tried climbing my wall. I would really love to hear what anyone reading this thinks.

 My whole family has experienced something in this house, and I will continue knowing that it IS haunted. The only history that we know about it is that a woman died from a disease, and she did die in the house. As far as that, there's nothing else I know. But these are my REAL LIFE, COMPLETELY HONEST stories."
"A Mother's Final Goodbye","Massachusetts","Family / Friends Visits","S o at first I'd like to say that this story is a little foggy to me so I don't have the detailed specifics of the story. Also I have to explain a few things in order for a few of you to understand where I'm coming from first of all I am currently an adopted child living with my aunt (my mother's sister). I address her as mom seeing as I've lived with her since I was a toddler. This information will most likely be useful for future encounter and experiences. 

 It was Early September I think. It was a cold morning and was during the early 2000s. I was in bed with my aunt and I think I was three at the time this happened, but I was sitting on the bed while my Aunt was asleep next to me. I still didn't really know how to talk; it came out as mostly mumbles and babbling but what I remember is feeling this sort of presence during this time. 

My mother was in the hospital for something, I don't exactly remember what, but she was getting progressively better. I remember sitting on the bed then turning my head to the upper left corner of the room right where the two walls of the room and the roof come together. I then proceeded to speak fluently clear English to said corner of the room. (Though sadly I don't remember what the conversation was about) But what I do remember about the conversation was it felt very odd. Now during this conversation my aunt had woken up because she heard me talking and started to freak out a little. 

There is one distinct sentence I can remember clear as day that I said, it was ""Goodbye Mom"" A few minutes later we got a call a call from the house phone. My mom had died shortly after I uttered those two words.

I still don't know if this is classified as spiritual because as I said the story is hazy for me but to me it seemed less spiritual and more it still gives me the shivers every time I look back at it."
"Haunted Closet","North Carolina","Haunted Places","It was the year 2015, and I was 12 turning 13. My father had beeen deployed to North Carolina for military business as a National Guard soldier. We lived in a bit of a small town called Fayettville in a large neightborhood called Pine Valley.

Now, it was a tradition to visit my mother and stepdad in the Alaskan islands near Canada every summer (though I haven't been doing that because of personal reasons). My twin and my little sister would celebrate our birthdays there and spend about 2 to 3 months until either August turned up or when school was nearing it opening. 

My parents planned to fly us to Alaska while they moved to North Carolina, so we packed and left. 

My mother and stepdad used to live in a one story, old red-painted house that looked like a trailer on the inside. My stepdad worked in a fish hatchery and a small forest intercepted the two properties. My siblings and I slept in a small bedroom with two bunk beds, since the house was so small. It was quite crowded and it was at the very end of the house. 

I was on the bottom bunk facing the open closet one night (why is it always closets?) and clearly, I couldn't sleep. I was staring at the open doors and just... Staring. And slowly, I watched as a little blonde-haired girl appeared underneath a shelf, wearing a white nightgown and curled into herself. I wasn't very bothered and found myself sleeping soon enough. 

~

 (Did I meation that the house in ""Navy Blue Paint"" had an elevator?) 

I had gotten a camera for my 13th birthday and we'd finally settled nicely into our house, which was fairly new and quite fancy. I met a girl named Bella who'd heard that there were new neighbors in the house about a block away from hers, but that isn't part of this story. 

Anway, I had gotten a new camera. Of course, being obsessed with its functions, I played around with its flash quite often. And everyone's heard of orbs and strange bits of light being captured on the screen, and after a few weeks of taking many unnecessary pictures of myself (though I am not a narsissitic person), I noticed the exact things showing up on my screen. 

I confided in my stepmom and told her about the strange appearances, and she clearly claimed that it was just the lights in my room. Obviously, I didn't believe her, so I moved from pictures to recordings. 

And to my paranormal-obsessed self, that was pure gold. 

I captured floating orbs moving in and out of my screen and showed the evidence to my disbelieving stepmom, but she still tried to debunk it. I don't blame her! Everyone has different beliefs. 

~ 

I returned to Alaska for another summer when I was 13 turning 14. We had moved out of the first house and moved across the street. We had a very friendly neighbor who was willing to let us rent his house when he moved away. I hadn't experienced any paranormal activity since that day. 

Until the next summer. 

It was night. I was in the same bottom bunk across from the open-door closet and I couldn't sleep because there was a newspaper boy in the same spot the little girl was in the previous summer. He wore a faded hat, overalls with brown shorts, and belt-buckle shoes. I gave a little wave. He waved back. 

That was the last time I experienced anything otherworldly until January 2019."
"Ghostbusters-loving Ghost","Pennsylvania","Haunted Places","There's a family down the street from us. They have a boy my age and a girl a year younger than my sister. The boy and I used to be close friends when we were younger but we drifted apart, now talking when we see each other but nothing more. My sister, and his sister, though, are best friends. We'll call my sister C and her friend T.

Every year, the family has a 'block' party. They invite the whole street and friends of T and J (the boy) over. It's the Sunday before labor day and, after partying for a while, everyone goes to the local golf course that's only a street away and watch the end of summer fireworks. I normally dread going because I hate parties but I do get to hang out with one of my friends who live next door. My sister, on the other hand, loves it.

This past year, while I was with my friend, my sister, T and a new friend, who had just moved in a few houses down from T, and a whole year younger than T, all went up to T's room for a fashion show. T had her mom's phone to take pictures and have music and such. It's still early, bright, we had only been there for a while. C and T and their new friend try on a few outfits, having fun dancing to the songs and taking pictures when T suddenly has to go to the bathroom. She closes the music app, turns the phone off and places it down her bed, standing up and leaving to go to the bathroom, leaving C and L (new friend) alone. Since L was new, and my sister, who is the opposite of me and can talk to a stranger her age without worrying and being friends with over half the girls in her grade, decides to start talking to L. They talk for a bit.

Then, out of nowhere, the Ghostbusters theme starts playing. They both jump a mile into the air and turn to T's bed. The phone is on and playing Ghostbusters. While C and L are looking at it like it's going to blow up, T comes back in and hears the music playing. She asks how they got it because, first off, her mom didn't have the Ghostbusters theme song on her phone and second, she had a pin to get in that only her family knew. C and L tell her what happens and she freaks out, throwing the phone back on the bed. She had picked it up to turn off the music.

They all ran downstairs and tell T's mom, but she doesn't believe them and tells them to go play. They agree, but don't go back upstairs and leave the house, heading into the backyard to play, trying to shake it off.

 Someone started that music and it wasn't anyone at the party. There was no way for anyone to start the music unless it was C or L and they had no idea how to get into T's mom's phone let alone pull up a song. But someone did and I have a feeling that it was a ghost. One who may or may not want to leave earth."
"The Shadow Upstairs","Florida","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","This happened about 1995, I was 33 at the time. We lived in Tampa Florida in an apartment and my sister and her kids lived in the apartment right across the porch. Her kids ran back and forth between both places most of the time. I would babysit them when she and her husband went out, sometimes even over night. 

Once the kids were in bed I would hear dishes clanking, like someone was putting the dishes away or moving them around. At first I thought my sister and her husband came back early, but once I was down stairs I saw no one. I went to the kitchen it was empty as well. I sat and watched T.V., and shrugged it off. 

Later that night at about 11pm, I was snacking on chips and watching a story on T.V. I stopped because I smelled an odor. I sniffed trying to find out where it was coming from. I went upstairs and the smell got stronger. I began to panic I didn't want something to be on fire and I still couldn't find anything. Then the odor disappeared, I couldn't smell it any more. I went back downstairs but I was nervous and kept sniffing every once in a while to make sure that I didn't smell it again.

At about midnight my sister came home. I told her about the noises and the smell. She and her husband looked at each other and then said it was nothing. And I was quickly shown the door.

A few weeks later they asked if I could babysit her kids again. I said yes, not thinking about what happened last time. They said they would be out until about 2am this time. It was a weekend so I let the kids stay up a little past their bed time. At about 10pm I put them to bed and settled down on the couch and dozed off.

I woke up to the sound of dishes clanking together again in the kitchen. I got up and turned on the lights but no one was there. The hair on the back of my neck stood on end. I was unsure what to do. Then I smelled the odor again but this time I recognized the smell as cigarette smoke. I checked on the kids they were sleeping. I looked outside thinking someone was smoking on the porch, but again no one was there. 

I sat on the couch and took a deep breath and tried to make sense out of what I was experiencing. I took a quick glance up the stairs and I froze. Standing at the top landing was a shadow of a man, then the smell hit me and I could see the tip of the cigarette glow red as he took a puff. Every thing was a shadow except the red tip. He looked in my direction then disappeared. I quickly checked on the kids and sat waiting for my sister and her husband to come home. I was trembling and kept looking up the stairs just waiting for him to come back.

When they came home I told them what I saw and this time I demanded they tell me what was going on. They said it was a ghost. It doesn't hurt anyone and all I have to do when I hear the dishes or see him is to tell him to stop and to leave. I asked them why they didn't tell me that before. They said they hoped that I wouldn't notice him. I was mad for a while at them but three months later they moved due to a job closer to where they wanted to live. I would sit on the porch at night and sometimes I would look up at the window. Sometimes I would see the shadow and his red tipped cigarette looking back. I moved a year later."
"The Doorbell","Florida","Haunted Places","This is my first submission of many, because throughout my life I have experienced some strange occurrences since I was around 8 years old.

Here goes nothing!

It was the eve of Halloween, and I was sitting on my couch alone watching a paranormal investigation program that I believe was called Most Haunted LIVE. You may have heard of it. In this episode they were live streaming an investigation in Edinburgh. This particular event lasts three days, from the 29th-31st. (Oct. 30, 2006 is the date of this occurrence) 

Anyway, the only other people in the house was my sister who was already asleep, my mom and stepdad who were watching TV in their room.

As I was absorbed watching this investigation take place, I heard the doorbell ring at approximately 9:30pm. The very strange thing is, it only rang the first tone. Just the ""Ding"", but not the ""Dong"". No one in the house was expecting anyone. In fact, I was the only one who checked the door and nobody else came out of their rooms.

A little weirded out but I checked the door to see who would be ringing the bell at this hour anyway.

But nobody was there...

I looked around the bushes outside that adorned the house on either side of the door and there was no trace of anything.

I shrugged it off thinking okay maybe it is just the doorbell acting weird. Even if it was just a traditional doorbell. Nothing fancy about it. This was 2006 before the high tech doorbells we have today.

So I sat back down and kept watching the program for at least 30 minutes or so before the same exact thing happened again.

""Ding""...

My front door had a glass window in the center. So if anyone was there I would be able to see at least a torso.

I watched the door from the couch and stared through the glass to see if there was any movement. Although I was far away, I wasn't far enough to not notice anyone at the door if anyone had really been standing there. At this point I had the hallway light, living room light, and the light of the entranceway on. And the light outside. 

I sat still and then comes my cat Gizmo, slowly emerging from the hallway (located to the right of the entrance), walking slowly to the front of the door and sat down a few feet from the door square in the middle. He just stared at the door. I was so freaked out at this point but I had to know now if anyone was really there. My cat obviously sensed something there. (Animals always sense things anyway) 

But I was too scared to answer the door myself so I went to get my Step dad first.

 As I passed my cat who was STILL staring at the door, and began to walk down the hall to my parent's room, I turned around a moment to see Gizmo had turned to then stare directly at ME as I kept walking down the hallway. This made my hair stand on end.

 I knock on my parents' door and ask if they heard the doorbell ring. They shook their head and looked at eachother then at me, and said ""No, what are you talking about?"" So I explained that the doorbell rang twice but how it was different than normal. So we checked outside and nobody was there. My step dad went outside too, and nobody was anywhere around the house either. We also checked the doorbell and rang it ourselves, and it sounded perfectly fine like it should be.

Of course they just thought I was hearing things and so on since I was watching a paranormal program. Parents, am I right?

Anyways, I know what I experienced was real, but what could it have been? I've heard of bad omens of knocks on the door or ringing the doorbell in regards to the death of loved ones, however, nobody I knew died.

I haven't told this story on the web before. I hope you guys enjoyed this real story. I'll have more experiences to share in the future."
"Something Doesn't Want Me To Eat My Skittles","New York","Haunted Places","A background for my experiences:

The house was built in 1902. It was constructed by the same man who built the house next door. The house next door was the man's personal home. Before our home was built, the family next door used our lot as a dumping ground. If you dig down a foot, you'll come across a layer of the ash from their fireplace. Dig below that, and shards of porcelain, so well preserved that you can still see the gold and silver details, will start to come up.

When we first moved in, there was an old carriage (complete with feed trough) barn in our backyard. Unfortunately, the barn had not been maintained, and had become too dangerous to enter. My Father was forced to demolish it.

We have also had to do a lot of work on our home. We had to remove all the horsehair plaster we found in our walls, because it created too many drafts. We've also had to replace most of the windows, as well as all of the original wallpaper. Most of my ""being watched"" feeling, is around my Dad's office (the former front parlor), the upstairs bathroom along the wall shared by the toilet and shower, in front of the door leading to the basement, and in front of my bedroom door. Sometimes the feeling of being watched gets so bad, I can't turn my back on the area of the house the feeling seems to be the origin of the feeling.

It's also important to note, that my town was the site of two military encampments. One during the French and Indian War, and the second during the War of 1812. The land itself was purchased from the local tribe of Native Americans in the 17th century. There are stories, and physical evidence of Native American raids, throughout the town. The nearby city (I could literally walk to it if I wanted to), is known for it's haunted locations. It sits on the original location of a 16th century outpost. There was one winter when the French came down from Canada and attacked the outpost.

They killed or captured more then half the population. Then, while trekking to the nearest colony, the population was halved again, as the settlers were forced to walk through the wilderness in their nightclothes. The people who died in this attack are buried in a nearby cemetery. There are even stories of statues in the cemetery moving on their own.

There are also at least three other cemeteries near my home. One that is quite large, I often walked past on my way to Elementary school. Another is incredibly old and quite small (there can't be more then ten headstones total), this one is located a few blocks from the center of town, which is just behind my house. The third, is so close that I can see it from my front porch. It's just in front of an old church. This is the one that causes me the most concern. Every now and then, as I'm about to go upstairs, I find myself looking out the window in the front door and ""checking"" the entrance of the church parking lot. I've never really been able to walk through it, and I will actively avoid it if I find myself walking home after sun down.

So, I'm going to keep this short. I know I haven't posted in a while. That's because things around my house have died down. 

This past Easter, my Mother gave me several bags of Easter candy. One of these is a bag of skittles, my favorite candy. Well, tonight, I've been thinking about opening up that bag of skittles; but every time that thought passes through my head, I get the image of me eating a skittle, and choking on it. The image is vivid enough to stop me from even reaching for the bag of candy.

I should note, that up until these past few years, my house was paranormally active. Several of my past experiences have already been posted here.

However what I haven't posted is that sometimes I will go to open a door, only to get the feeling that I shouldn't open that door quite yet, because there was something ""not so nice"" on the other side. Alongside that feeling would be an image of a tall black shadow, standing on the other side.

I get the feeling that something is trying to protect me. But from what, and why?"
"Antique Piano Finds A Forever Home","Georgia","Misc","This story started as a reply to Phillip Kafka's recent post about ""50 King Street."" I realized it just got too lengthy for a reply, so decided to make it a story. It never occurred to me before that it was a ""haunting"" or anything paranormal, but maybe it is?

PhillipKafka had talked about his time in an apartment with antiques that might've been visited by spirits. I have a lot of antique furniture, including wardrobe with mirror, 18th century linen press and others. I have an old secretery with glass doors next to my bed, and after my mom died I was having lots of dreams and woke one morning to find the glass doors open, sort of creepy. Otherwise have never experienced anything overt connected with my antiques. I do, as I'm polishing maybe, or dusting them or otherwise caring for them, sometimes get a sort of energy from them and always am aware of how I appreciate them and have sort of a ""duty"" to care for them to the best of my ability. It's all positive. And though I've probably seen too many movies, etc. About ""haunted furniture"" -- it does strike the imagination -- my home is a bright, cheery place decorated in a southern traditional ""beachy"" style, with these pieces interspersed (sorry for you all who're yawning at the decorating stuff, haha).

I also had an upright piano, bought in the '90s. It was a former player piano c. 1908, refinished, very pretty with a mirror installed where the music roll had been. The old piano collector/refurbisher in McDonough, Georgia had it out in his refinishing shed, a dreary, humid, barn-like place with many other pianos in various stages of work. I drove over an hour (I'm north of Atlanta), answering a small ad in the paper, and the old gentleman sold the instrument to me for about $150. I was a single mom, a widow, in my thirties and thought I hit the jackpot! My 8 year old daughter really wanted to learn (I wasn't musical and didn't realize I could've also bought a keyboard). Anyway, we got guys to move it cheap, and it became the center of our home and a happy thing... Daughter would play, practice and she and her friends would always mess around with it, being creative. A few years later, she could play Christmas carols and we'd all stand around and sing while she played, and it was perfect for putting decorations on top. The old player really held a place of honor in our family room.

When I re-married and we moved to our next home, daughter was a teen and decided to stop playing, so the heavy piece stayed in our drive-under basement storage room. At one point there was a sofa stored on top of it. One night, in the very middle of the night, my daughter woke up (in her room two stories directly above where the piano was stored) screaming, ""MOM! MOM!"" She swore she heard the piano playing. I had remarried and had a new baby, so I'm sure I was just exhausted, but have a vague memory of maybe believing I heard it too, and my new husband (who also thinks he heard it) immediately grabbed a baseball bat and went down to investigate. The lid to the piano keys was closed, so it couldn't have been an animal or anything walking on top. He saw nothing else out of place.

I like to think it was just the piano, reminding us it was still there for whatever reason, however spooky or dreamlike. We lived there ten years, never using the piano. But when we moved in here to our forever home, the piano got back a new place of honor, right at the center of our home, even though our daughter had gone to college. Then we inherited my mom's baby grand, so we had two pianos! Eventually, we decided to get rid of the antique, and were in the process of trying to figure out how. At one point, I was going to give it to a young family whose kids wanted to learn, but that fell through. Then one Saturday, my husband and I were literally talking about it when a knock came on our door. A local church youth group was playing this game where they start with a pencil and have to go around and trade UP for objects larger or better. They currently had an old flat screen tv, did we have anything that worked for their game? Immediately, we looked at each other and said, ""How about a piano?"" We truly didn't think they could do it, but they said, ""Oh, we have a truck!"" They were thrilled! So 10 big teenage boys rolled the piano out and onto the truck. A couple of them could play, and they played it even as they were lifting it into the truck (which conveniently had a hydrolic lift) and it's now sitting in the church youth room (in the church where our babies had attended pre-school). It seemed the PERFECT place for our old piano, and I often believe it's what God had intended. Perhaps we were just the care-givers in between homes! Sorry to tell such a long story. I never even thought about personifying that piano, and had completely forgotten about the night we thought we heard it play, until PhillipKafka made me think of my antiques. Thanks for reading!"
"Red Eyed People In My Room With Threats To Kill","Oklahoma","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","Let me start by saying, thank you all for reading this! It means a lot and sorry in advance if this is really long. Brevity is not my strong suit and these details are I promise you, very relevant to setting this story up. I have two families and they live across the country from each other.

 Ever since I can remember my dad, being the piece of soggy lettuce that he is, always made me feel uneasy when I was with him. No, he never hit me or assaulted me in any way, he's not that soggy lol. But I always felt like we were never alone in the many homes that we lived in.

 This time, in particular, I was around 7 or 8 and I was visiting my dad for the week in Oklahoma (I live in South Dakota so I didn't visit often). My dad and new stepmom had just moved into a new home and it was only us three and my dog. I had a small room with my bed against the wall facing my closet door THIS IS IMPORTANT. I had a small dresser with a TV that had an automatic shut off because I could never fall asleep without it on.

 Another strange fact about being with my dad is that I was deathly afraid of the dark just like any young kid is, but when I would stay with him, I always felt compelled to sleep with no lights on. However, I would always, and I mean ALWAYS make sure that I had my closet light on with the door shut before I went to sleep. And this is the same in any house that I lived in with him. Every morning I would wake up with my door shut and light on so I know my dad never came into my room and turned it off. So this was not a one-time thing. 

 One night I fell asleep like watching some Netflix like usual with my same closet situation. I woke up at around 3 am and at this time I didn't know what this meant but to my surprise, it was not good. So I woke up to my closet door open and the light turned off. I instantly felt sick to my stomach. With complete body chills. I know that this was not sleep paralysis because I was able to sit up and I could move my arms, legs, and eyes.

 I looked to the side to where my dresser ended and I saw these freaking scary people with grey skin and red eyes. There were 4 men, 2 little girls, and two little boys. On the far left, there were two little girls that looked scarily like me from the past when I went to a catholic school and wore green checkered jumper dresses and they had long brown hair. In the middle closest to the girls were two identical men in business suits and black hair. The men to the right of them had all grey on. Baggy sweatpants and baggy hoodies and grey tennis shoes. Then to the right of them on the end, there were two little boys with identical clothes to the men in grey sweats. I about crapped my pants.

 The two men in suits started whispering to me and the voices I eventually heard were threats to kill me and all of my family if I didn't get them to leave in a certain amount of time. ""You don't have long. We will kill you. You better hurry. HURRY. We will kill you."" They kept repeating until finally one of the little girls screamed and ran toward me and they disappeared right as I opened my mouth to scream. To my surprise, it was my own scream the whole time. However, I know that I was not sleeping as I could move and jump right out of bed to run to my parent's room.

 My dad and stepmom were annoyed that I woke them up but became scared when they saw I ironically looked like I had seen a ghost. But oh, not just one, 8. They still being the trash bags filled with wet socks that they are, didn't really do much about it after that night.

 My mom doesn't really believe in this type of stuff but when I told her she looked terrified and simply prayed over me a few times. Well, that was my story with the paranormal. Sorry for the length and thanks for reading!"
"Phone Call Voices","Mississippi","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I would like to begin by saying that while everything that I heard and happened to me has taken place in Mississippi, my best friend is at the center of the story too, and he lives in Colorado. I'm choosing to name the location as MS because the story is coming from me.

This friend of mine--we'll call him Mitch--was going through an interest in mediumship. He was interested in a meditative practice where he called on souls of the dead to ""meditate"" with him, give him information, etc. The first night that he did it, he was sure to use protective measures.

The second night, he said that he slipped up and completely forgot to call on only ""spirits of the highest good,"" and simply invited in spirits. Mitch told me that while things started off normally, he started realizing that he was getting angrier and angrier. At one point he became distracted and kept thinking about how all men are terrible and need to be ""taught a lesson."" At some point he realized that the anger was foreign, closed the session, and commanded the spirits to leave.

But for about a week after that, there were a number of times where he and I seemed to have ""interrupted"" phone calls. I might have said that it was normal, that our call was picking up on frequency or other calls or something like that, but every time either of us heard the voice, it was ""intelligent""--I mean to say, in each case it was responding to what we were saying, or otherwise noting that it knew who we were.

I was the first one to hear it. I was outside and we were talking on the phone. We were laughing at something or another when I heard, quite clearly, a third person laughing that sounded female. At first I thought it was my voice echoing, because sometimes that happens, but it wasn't happening before or after that exact moment.

A few days after that, we were talking on the phone again and Mitch was trying to tell me something, but I got distracted by my little dog. I heard him say, ""How do you know? I didn't tell you.""

""What? I'm confused.""

""I was telling you that I listened to affirmations while I slept and you said 'I know'.""

""No, I didn't.""

""You didn't say 'I know'?""

""No...""

A few days after that it spoke to him again, saying ""yes"" after he asked something or another.

The final time he heard it, we were talking about various Gods and Goddesses. He had asked me something about Greco-Roman deities. I was explaining when he interrupted and asked me if I had said something about Morgana, who is sometimes viewed as a Celtic Goddess.

I was uncomfortable with how the spirit seemed to be ""watching"" him and asked him to ask the angels to remove the spirit if it was malevolent.

He did. It was about thirty minutes later when I finally heard the voice again, except this time it was more like a man's that whispered ""Bran-di..."" I asked Mitch if he whispered my name, and when he said no I decided to try to ""banish"" it as well. Neither of us have heard anything like that over the phone since."
"The Non Believer","Ohio","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","My brother-in-law came home from work last night and described that he saw something strange moving quickly across the road up ahead but when he got there, there wasn't anything there. He kind of believes in aliens but not ghosts so he told us he thought he saw an alien or ""something"". He knows that I have seen ghosts and lived in the haunted house of Hinsdale NY before the people who told the story, so he looked up ghosts for Salem, Ohio and saw a picture of EXACTLY what he saw. It was posted here on this site under Crybaby Bridge. I think this just may have made him a believer. 

Thanks for reading just thought I would share this. 

 I wish you could have seen his face and heard his voice while he was describing his experience... It was one of shock, wonder, awe, disbelieving, realization all wrapped up at once... 

 I just didn't think I would see the day that he actually became to believe in ghosts... 

Just an added note:

 We are new to Ohio but you can bet I WILL be checking on different sites for hauntings near by once we can start going 

Out in public again. I look forward to discovering all the wonders and hopefully experiencing some actual ghosts hanging 

Around different spots, but I don't plan on bringing any attachments home with me; so therefore I Will be going on these 

Tours AFTER properly protecting myself and others who accompany me. 

If you know of any truly reputable ghostly places to go feel free to share them with me. 

 I would truly appreciate it.

 Be Safe, Be Healthy,

"Demonic Voice?","Texas","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","When I first joined the Air Force in 1988, I was away from home and I got my first taste of freedom. I could do whatever I wanted. I didn't even talk to my parents that much either. So I partied a lot on the weekends. I really enjoyed the dorm parties. I was sleeping with a lot of girls too and I wasn't going to church or doing anything with regards to religion/God. I wasn't doing anything positive.

 I had something happen to me that I don't understand. I swear I didn't do anything to provoke what happened to me. I have always been super scared of ghosts and demons. One 3 day weekend I drank and drank and drank beer until I could barely stand. I went back to my dorm room and it was super dark. I felt like something was wrong in my dorm room, I couldn't quite put a finger on it, I felt so alone. 

I don't understand what happened next-I had a vision of the Exorcist girls' face and I heard her demonic voice plain as day in my room telling me ""the devil is going to get you Bill..."" I almost pissed myself. I was so scared and afraid! I was having trouble breathing too. I was in a panic and I didn't know what to do. I immediately grabbed my Bible and I started to pray to God for protection. I felt better after praying and I slept with my Bible the rest of the night. 

I didn't play with Ouija boards or tarot cards or anything negative! I love ghost stories and things about the supernatural. I never heard the Exorcist girls' voice again... I wonder what could it be? Please help me out guys..."
"The Face In The Camera Screen","Ohio","Haunted Places","This isn't a big story, but it still has me rattled and I felt worth sharing.

I am an investigating consultant for insurance companies. Basically, I get hired to go out and look at property insurance (building/homeowners, etc) claims when the insurance company is having a hard time figuring it out to try to determine what happened. 

Unfortunately, I am considered an essential employee during the COVID19 shutdown, and still have to go into people's homes. I have been wearing white disposable dust masks as a precaution, and request the homeowners put a mask on if they can so we can avoid spreading anything to each other.

A week or so ago, I had a claim to inspect in a 1850's Victorian house in NE Ohio near Erie, PA. The house was a bed and breakfast at one point and absolutely huge. There were rumors of the home having been involved in the Underground Railroad. 

For the purpose of my inspection, I had to go into the basement. The basement was like a maze with brick vaulted supports in areas; portions you can stand, and portions that are only crawlspaces. I was wearing my N95 mask, and the homeowner was wearing one as well. I went into a portion of the basement where I had to hop up over this partial wall and duck under a low brick archway support (kind of looked like a pizza oven), then it opened up into a larger area where I could partially stand. I'm taking photographs for my report, using an actual digital camera vs. My phone. The digital camera had one of those rear facing image screens, would flash the image of the photo I just took, hold it on the screen for a second, then the screen would go blank for a second before it would pull up the live view for me to take my next photo. 

As I take a picture, when the screen goes blank, I see a reflection of a woman right behind me in the screen. I assumed it was the homeowner who followed me into this area, but it still startled me. I turn to look and there's nobody there. This all took place over the course of a second. So I go back to the opening to this room and look out and see the homeowner standing in a different part of the basement with her N95 mask on. The reflection I saw was not wearing an N95 mask. 

So I'm freaked out, but I still have to continue my inspection. I take another picture, and sure enough, there's a reflection of someone in the room behind me. It wasn't my own reflection because I could see my face, which since I'm close to the camera was so big it took up half the screen. This was like the shoulders, neck, and head of a female figure standing about 5-6 feet behind me over my right shoulder. I turn around --- nobody there. Since I paid better attention this second time, I noticed the figure was wearing some type of head covering, like a tight hood or a bonnet, but it was very thin material and tight around her head. She was definitely female, but looked older than the homeowner who was probably in her 30's, this lady looked about late 40's. So I continued my inspection and didn't see the reflection again. 

I was there for professional reasons and didn't want to come off weird bringing up that I think I saw a ghost in her basement, so I didn't outright bring it up to the homeowner, but I asked a few leading questions to try to get her to talk about if she thought her house was haunted - she didn't say anything.

So who knows, but I definitely saw something!"
"Strange Coincidence Or Something Else?","California","Misc","In 2007 I was going through a very rough time, due to a severe anxiety disorder that I have. One day I was trying to distract myself from the obsessive worry and went online to look at wallets, as mine was falling apart. I've always loved those little inexpensive brocade wallets and billfolds with the bright colors, so I was checking some out on Ebay, and finding it an enjoyable distraction. Then the anxiety intruded full force, and I stopped browsing, thinking that it was silly of me to try to distract myself from the things that were causing panic. Anyone who suffers from chronic anxiety will be familiar with how intense it can get if you 'dare' to try to relax or enjoy something. So I walked away from the laptop and went out the door to run some errands. 

The house I lived in at the time had a large flower box in front, with some plants with long green fronds. I glanced over at the flower box as I walked past it, and nestled in the fronds of one of those plants was a little red brocade coin purse. My jaw sort of dropped, because I thought at the time, 'What a strange coincidence that the little purse was probably tossed in there, maybe by a little girl in a stroller or something like that, right around the time I'd been looking at little brocade purses.' I remember that I took it out of the fronds and placed it on the flower box itself (the box faced the sidewalk), on the off chance that whoever had lost or thrown it might pass by again and retrieve it. It was gone pretty soon after that, though I can't remember how soon. I never looked inside the purse. It was so tiny and light that it was probably empty anyway. Not even big enough to hold anything other than a few coins. But it just didn't feel right to look inside it, though I have no idea why. 

A few years later when I got interested in reading about signs from loved ones who have passed, I started to think about the possibility of a normal thing happening (a little girl tossing a purse into a plant) with the significance of *when* it happens maybe not being just coincidence after all. Because when I first saw that purse, even though my mind took the logical route about how it got there, something in me also felt comforted quite a bit, like 'somebody' was trying to tell me that things were okay, that it was okay to enjoy life."
"Our Discovery","North Carolina","Haunted Places","Hoping everyone is doing well through our Covid-19 tribulation. I wanted to share this experience with you while it is storming outside right now and a scary songbird is whistling outside my window, it seemed like the perfect time. Plus the bird is freaking me out. 

We had a beach rental that had been in our family and my cousin and I would take turns sleeping in an upstairs bedroom that for some reason was quieter than the other bedrooms. It was a decent size rental and at least 12 of us. It was my turn to sleep in the bedroom for this trip and my experience took a creepy turn which led to a discovery. I went to bed and was awoken by my hand freezing. Lying on my side one of my hands felt ice cold. I felt like the air was thick and fear crept up inside me. I moved to a different position and tried to go back to sleep but it happened again to my back, like something cold was behind me. 

I turned the light on and looked around the room. In the corner was a dresser and a white door and a latch on it. I knew the air unit attic access was behind that door, but something made me feel like there was more. I pushed the dresser aside and opened the latch. Opening the door I moved the foam board and looked into a black room, where the air unit system was. I figured I would investigate it in the morning with my cousin, and closed it back. 

The following morning I pulled him and grabbed a flashlight, some flour and said we had to go look for something. Opening the door again we stepped inside the room and looked with the flashlight. It was a big space and we didn't see anything or anyone. I threw flour in the space all over everything to see if footprints were there. It was fine but we agreed to check tomorrow. That night I woke to a tapping behind the wall and it was on the right side of the area we looked at. The tapping kept up all night, so I didn't sleep. I got up and banged on the wall a few times and it stopped but started again. 

The following morning we went back inside and the flour was untouched but this time we turned to look towards the right of us and found that the space had a small ramp upwards. Fear crept inside of me, what if someone was living up there and we were going to get killed? I was terrified. We both climbed up the ramp and came upon another huge room that was over the bedroom. It was weird in there, like insulation in an area had been removed and molded to make a bed. We found Girlie magazines and socks, but the thing was everything was extremely dusty and hadn't been touched in years. 

There weren't any signs of anything new there at all. We quietly went to the kitchen and grabbed gloves and a trash bag and headed back to the room. We knew not to touch anything with bare hands, so we carefully removed these items in the bag and put them in another trash bag outside in the yard for trash pick-up. We went back to the room and said prayers and rosary, and later that day went back to smudge with sage after we bought some.

Our relatives had this rental for years and eventually stopped renting it due to old age and family members too busy with life to rent it again. But before that happened, I asked a neighbor about the house. She was out walking her dog and past me standing in front of the home, she told me there was a couple that lived there and had fights a lot. She also said a man got shot from an altercation in the house. Because it happened so long ago, I couldn't find it online looking up the history, I continued to feel the cold touches off and on and sometimes felt like someone was watching me. 

I still slept in the room sometimes but when I did, I put duct tape on the air vent and blocked the latch door with the dresser. I spoke to the ""Ghost"" and told it I'm not going to hurt it but stop touching me. I didn't hear the tapping sound except sometimes and would bang on the wall and tell ""IT"" to knock it off. It seemed to listen to me. It was an experience that I had when I was around 17. Now that these relatives are much older they don't rent beach homes anymore. My cousin and I vowed not to tell them about it. It never bothered him.

 Nothing else happened in the home and we stopped renting it decades ago. It was a beautiful home surrounded by both the ocean and the bay, a quieter piece of water. It was somewhere in the Outer Banks, NC."
"Spirits That Find Us","New York","Haunted Places","When my husband moved in with us after we married. We experienced an entity that we were told was a woman who scratches males. He would wake up to long scratches on his back or in weird spots on his body. Other events would happen like running water when nobody was in that room, or someone running up and down the basement steps. Other family members heard these things as well. Since we rented we decided to move. The day we moved out we saw a shadow figure in the top floor window staring at us. Because of my past experiences and my husband's relating to ghosts and spirits, we would cleanse each place we moved to and say blessings as well we are Catholics, so holy water and rosaries were always a given. These events stopped but it seemed like every place we lived at, had some sort of entity never bad, but always present.

 We now decided to venture into witchcraft and learning about spells and protection and candles blessed as well crystals. There are mixed opinions about everything, but we do what works for us. As we dive into learning about herbs and magick, we have salt protection, witches balls, etc and so far things are better. The air within our home feels safe and lighter. But one day recently my husband saw a shadow figure in the kitchen a couple of times in one day. He didn't tell me until I noticed him constantly staring past me. I jumped up reaching for holy water and demanded to know what it was. I do not know why but I smudged with sage, black salt, lit candles with crystals in them, threw protection oil and water in the spot he saw it plus everywhere, and opened a door trailing my spell and smudge smoke out with me. I walked around the entire home and continued my ritual and since then everything is fine. So, why does this keep happening to us? 

We know that water and mirrors are portals for spirits, negative thoughts, anger, and sometimes antiques carry spirits that cling. We know that watching demonic shows etc lots of ways to have something attach itself to you but can I get a break? Yes, we fear the unknown and I'm not dabbling in witchcraft that is harmful. I'm learning and with an experienced Witch who has credibility. 

Yet, I feel like everywhere around us is haunted and free-roaming spirits seem to cling to us. I do not buy antiques anymore, I do not have mirrors or water features in my home. The mirror in the bathroom has protection on it and I must mention my many Cats do not see anything. They were helpful in the past from other events that happened, but so far this place is safe. 

We are careful about what we watch and think and know we must be positive if we are to ask for positive intentions and outcomes.

I would like to hear your opinions about why you think we continue to have an experience, and I forgot to add we are Empaths. We are quite sensitive to emotions and people and their pain. Might this be the reason?

Be well and stay safe during this tribulation. Thank you for your thoughts."
"Brother Showing Me Early Signs","New York","Family / Friends Visits","For starters I'm going to say that this is my very first story here on this website. I love reading other people's ghosts stories here so I'm excited to share one of my own!

Recently on March 30th, 2020, my oldest brother Ronnie passed away so suddenly. We have all been devastated since we've received the bad news. Anyways let me get into the story now. I will try to keep it short.

On Sunday, I spoke to my brother out loud and asked him to give me signs to let me know he's okay up there. About two hours later I was in my room and began to clean. I had a movie on the tv but I wasn't paying attention due to me cleaning. Both of my remotes were on my bed, not around anything that can fall and land on the remotes to make it change channels or press buttons. As I'm spraying Lysol on my drawer, I noticed that the menu button on my cable remote was pressed. I instantly knew it was my brother because I had just asked for a sign and I'm positive that nothing else made the menu button be pressed. So instead of the movie being full screen, it showed the my library and guide section. If you have spectrum cable you'll understand.

Yesterday I was watching the Kardashians on demand because I missed the episode on Thursday. I paused the show about 40 minutes in, so I had about 15-20 minutes left to watch of that episode. If you know how the on demand works on spectrum cable, you'd understand that it doesn't go straight into the next episode of the show UNLESS you've completed the episode before. It literally just went right into the next episode without me pressing anything or without me even being done watching the episode I had on! 

Now today was different... I feel like he was getting to me through the tv before because he knew I was glued to it. Today I was a bit more distracted and wasn't paying attention to the tv so I guess he took a different approach. I was on FaceTime with my ex telling her about a tiny toothpaste that I have. I've always kept it in a ziplock bag along with dental floss and mint drops. I haven't touched that bag in months, nor do I use the drawer that the ziplock bag was in. When I pulled out the bag I saw a dime in there. I was so confused as to why a random coin was in there. When I went on google I searched ""signs that your deceased loved ones are around"" and I came across an article that said spirits will use coins to show you signs! Specifically a DIME. It all made sense to me when I sat and thought about it. I vividly remember the last time having that bag out and it definitely did NOT have that dime in there before. I always put my coins in this metal container that I have. And to think he didn't visit me today but he did, he just found another way to do so because I wasn't glued to the tv like normally. It's a bittersweet moment knowing that he visits me but I can't physically see him. 

Does anyone think it was actually him visiting me to let me know he was okay? Tell me what you think in the comments. 

I miss my brother so much. 😔😔 RIP Ronald 💙🙏🏼"
"Hide And Seek And The Little Boy","New York","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","(All names in this account have been changed for privacy reasons) 

My cousins have this huge property in a rural area, basically in the middle of nowhere. They have a huge farmhouse, a barn, stables, everything. Every year, for Thanksgiving, we (my family and I, along with other relatives) drive up to their place to celebrate. They have a huge house, and it has plenty of space for everyone.

 It was weirdly really warm for November, like short-sleeves weather, so the parents expected us to play outside. The eldest cousin, who I'll call John, suggested we play hide and seek. Before we ran off, he pointed to the abandoned guest house and said that it was haunted. We snickered because John was a big liar and no one believed him. But, oh boy, he sure was right. 

George, my aunt's son, who was my age, dared me to hide in the house. I looked at the dark, paint-peeled house. I didn't want to seem like a baby, so of course I went. 

I creaked open the door and snuck in. I took a creaky, decayed set of stairs to the second floor and ran into the first room I saw. The floor was covered in some wet substance that smelled metallic (blood?) but, the only thing on my mind was hide and seek. I hid in a closet and sat down. There was a black cloak hanging in the closet, and I hid behind it. I was there for a good 15-20 minutes before I heard the door downstairs creak open.

 A little boy giggled. I figured it was George, but then they started going upstairs. The footsteps stopped in front of my room. I froze, trying to stifle my laugh. But then the boy stepped in. He wasn't George. He was pale and covered in blood. He sat on the floor, giggling for what seemed like an hour. I couldn't look. Then it stopped. I ran out of the closet and floored it downstairs. I ran inside where my parents were about to call the police. I spilled everything. John gave me a look. ""I told you not to!"" He said.

Turns out the same thing happened to him when he was little."
"My Paranormal Experiences With My House","Texas","Haunted Places","My house is pretty new, and nobody has lived in it before our family has moved in, but for some reason we've been having really strange paranormal experiences. We have security cameras in our house, and lately we've been seeing stuff from them. One thing we've seen would be glowing orbs. We would see these glowing orbs constantly, almost every night. The orbs don't really do anything; they just kind of sit there.

 Another thing that I've experienced would be voices, and footsteps. Every night at around 12:00 am, I would hear footsteps and voices leading to our (at the time, my sister and I shared a room) room. It would always be two voices, one male, and one female. We could hear the individual footsteps leading to our room. They would go to the kitchen first, then the living room, then the hallway to our room, then they would just stop right in front of our door. Once the footsteps stopped, our parents woke up to check around the house before setting our house alarm. They never heard anything. My sister and I experienced this every Friday at 12:00 am, and we always prepared ourselves. It stopped happening when I turned 10.

 Another paranormal experience we've both experienced would be the knocks on my wall. So, my room shares a wall with my garage. My sister and I always heard noises from the garage, like stuff falling, simple stuff like that. Stuff that could be explained... But one evening, my sister and I were both sitting in my room, and we heard a knock on my wall. It was 3 clear knocks, as if somebody was knocking on a door. We left the room, and told our dad. I thought that my little sister did it, but she promised she didn't do it.

 About a year later, (at around 8:30 pm) I was sitting on my bed in my room, and I heard another knock. It wasn't as clear as the last knock, but it still concerned me. I went to my sister and told her that I had heard the knock again. We entered my room, and my sister said, ""Did you really hear a knock on your wall?"" and right when she said that, we heard 5 knocks on the wall. We screamed, and ran out of the room. My parents were asking us what had happened, and I had burst into tears. My dad thoroughly checked the garage, but there was nothing in there. That night, I slept in my sister's room. 

That was one of the scariest experiences I've had with the ghosts in my house. I do believe my house is haunted, but the question is, why is it haunted in the first place? I don't think anybody has died here. I hope that one day, I find out what is truly haunted in my house."
"Ghost Stole My Bracelet","Alabama","Misc","We used to have a ghost. We banished it and unfortunately that was before I realized my bracelet, made of real turquoise from the Sleeping Beauty mines in California and set in sterling silver was missing. I have searched this house of ours, even taken things apart to find it, but to no avail. I left it on the kitchen counter before it disappeared. Now I'm in a pickle, wondering how to get it back.

I came to the conclusion that I must call the ghost back (which I have no idea how to do, seeing as I did not get a name from it, nor an age), and demand my bracelet back. I have come to you all to ask advice on how to do this. Bear in mind asking things of this ghost did not work when it was here before. It is also malevolent, scratching both me and my younger brother, so protection precautions would also help. I am not a child of God as you so call it, but my brother is, and biblical scriptures for my brother to recite for himself and protection charms for me to perform would also be helpful. I am also a sensitive so I need extra strong protection (s). 

In the mean time I will be waiting for ya'll's help on this problem, and try to distract myself from it as I worry about everything in my life.

Help will be so very much appreciated as the bracelet has not only physical value but emotional and magickal value as well. It has protected me from a lot of things and I need it back ASAP. It has been missing for over 3 months, and I can sense it desperately needs me as I need it. 

 Blessed be~

"The Beautiful Lady In White","California","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I had been visiting the Queen Mary in long beach frequently. My girlfriend at the time was an entertainer and we use to go to their cocktail lodge after her performances. This was back in 1984/85. I've wanted to share this story for many many years. It wasn't until years later when I was watching a tv show about paranormal activity that I realized what had happened.

My Girlfriend and I were sitting in the cocktail lounge by a large piano. It was late. I remember a Woman in a beautiful white dress with lace coming around the left corner to our table. This was by a wall partition. The woman in a ornate white dress stood directly in front of us. Didn't say a word. She was very beautiful and brunette.

 I surmised she was there to take our order. I went and told her what we wanted and she continued to stand in front of our table. I commented to her that she was a good server because she didn't have to write the order down. I commented to her how beautiful her dress was and she smiled at me. She then turned away behind the partition and left. I took particular attention in the way in which she left. It was graceful, as if she was floating. I made the comment to my Girlfriend how milky white her skin was. About a few minutes later a waitress came to our table and I told her I'd already given my order to the lady in the white dress. She just looked at me stunned. I'll never forget it. 

It wasn't until years later that I heard about the Lady In White Dress on the Queen Mary. She was there. I met her. She didn't walk away. She floated away. This really happened and I wanted to share this."
"Navy Blue Paint","Washington","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","It was the year 2014, and I was 11 years old. My family (my dad, stepmom, and three biological siblings and three step-siblings) had recently moved from Alaska to Washington State and moved into what we call the ""Blue House"" because it was painted a dark, navy blue. I don't remember when the first haunting happened, but it was probably about a month or two after we'd settled in. 

There is a historical park called Olmstead about 40 minutes away from our home and I was fascinated by it. It used to belong to a family called the Olmsteads who'd settled in 1875 and built multiple houses. A ""caretaker"", you could say, told us stories about the ghosts she'd see around the property and there were stories about the family being buried under the floorboards. A few weeks after I'd started visiting the park, strange things began happening. 

Now that I look back, I suspect that either the spirits of that park had followed me home and had awoken the other residing in the ""Blue House"", or my own presence had awoken the whole other dimension up and decided to annoy me. 

For the first several months, I'd hear voices - whispering - and see humanoid shadows out of the corner of my eyes in broad daylight. My sister had even seen a man in our neglected garden wearing a khaki trench coat, but when she looked away and back again, he was gone. Nearing the spring of my first year and final year at the ""Blue House"", the hauntings got worse. 

And I began to see things. 

The first time was after I'd gone to the Olmstead park and it was late at night - probably around 9:30 P.M. I was in my bed with my closet sitting in front of me, doors wide open. My mind was clear and I was fully awake when I saw her. She was nearly indecipherable with my horrible vision (I have glasses), but as the minutes ticked by, she got clearer and more solid. She wore a 19th century brown dress with poufy sleeves and a dirty, white apron. Her chesnut hair was tied in a messy bun and she standing completely to the side. The only thing that creeped me out was her eyes. 

Because she didn't have any. 

A few weeks later, it was in the dead of night, and once again... I saw another one. Immediately, I got a horrible sense of dread, and it felt like ice was in my heart and was spreading to my vital organs. Another apparition appeared and they (I guess I could call it a ""her"" because it looked female) didn't have eyes. Just empty, black sockets. 

And she was staring right at me. 

I snuggled deeper into my covers and said, in a clear voice, ""Go away."" 

That was the wrong answer. Instantly, her whole demeanour changed. Her face contorted into fury and she vanished. The icy feeling in my chest grew larger and she reappeared at my dresser, in the corner of my room. 

Much closer than before. 

She began to rise from her crouched position and her nails morphed into deadly claws, like an animal. My mouth was sealed shut, and I was so scared I couldn't scream. Her mouth opened and - I turned away. 

Shaking like a leaf, I waited for impact, but none came. Slowly, I peekd from under my covers and saw that she was gone. 

I was relieved, but I didn't sleep well for the rest of that night.

About a month flew by, and once again, I was alone one day. It was 4:30 P.M, I was the only one in the hallway, and all the lights were off and my bedroom door was open. I was reading a book - a comic, probably - when I got chills. I looked up into the hallway and the sense of dread from all those days ago returned. 

Then, there was a head. A disembodied, floating head right outside my doorway. After a few seconds, it slid into the wall and all was quiet. I watched in morbid fascination as the disembodied head repeated itself three times. I decided to get outta there. I abandoned my book, walked out the door - closing it behind me - and went down the dark hallway. 

As I walked, I felt a breath on the back of my neck. The hairs there stood up and my skin prickled with goosebumps. Turning, I startled at the sight of another ghost! She (so many were either little girls or grown women) wore a flowing white dress and had a bundle of flowers in her right hand. I stared at her for a second before turning away and full-on sprinting up the stairs to share my tales. Of course my family didn't believe me. 

Then, my birthday rolled around. I was turning 12. My sisters' friends were over (I had problems socializing and the thought of having someone over just freaks me out) and was this huge, pink-and-more-pink birthday party. We all decided to got on this weird, dopey ghost hunt and used my brother's speaker-and-microphone to pick up the voices of the dead. 

That's when we went to my room at the very end of the hallway. 

My brother said he heard whispers. Scratching, as if someone were writing something on parchment. He heard shuffling, and a few bumps and nicks here and there. As an experiment, we left my creepy, glass doll on the dresser and went upstairs. After fooling around with dress-up and cake, we headed back downstairs. 

My creepy, glass doll had moved. It sat on one of the dresser previously, and then now it was on the other. 

We all started freaking out and yelling at each other, demanding if any of us had snuck downstairs and been a little sh*t and my parents got sick of it. They forbid us from hunting ""ghosts"" and all that nonsense, and we obliged. The hauntings slowed down to a stop, and by the end of the year... They hadn't said a peep. 

That was until I moved to North Carolina in 2015. 

And that's a story for another time!"
"Groans At My Bedroom Door","South Carolina","Haunted Places","I'm not really sure if this is worth posting, Hell, I'm not even sure if what I heard was legit, but I'll let you guys decided.

This happened just this past Saturday the 28th of March. I was on a long weekend because I had put in for time off to go to SC Comicon (I put in for the time long before the rescheduling due to Corona). My PTO started on Thursday and ran through Monday. Starting Thursday night I was having trouble sleeping, something just felt off and I had to sleep with my lamp on just to feel comfortable. Well Saturday night I was up late playing my PS4 when around 2:45 a.m. I started hearing this weird groaning sound right outside my bedroom door. I had my door closed so I wouldn't disturb my parents and it sounded like it was just on the other side.

Now if you read my previous story ""My Parents House"" then you would know about my experience with the attic and the image from the movie ""The Grudge"". Well it seemed like Kayako wasn't done with me because the groaning noise sounded exactly like the choking-groaning sounds she made only slower, almost hesitant or confused, I dunno. It was slow like ""urggh...urggh...urggh...urggh"". This repeated off and on until around 5:30-ish which is when I noticed I wasn't hearing it any more. I didn't time it to see how often it occured during that time, but it seemed to be about 10-20 minute intervals.

I thought it may have been my dad the first time I had heard it since he usually goes to bed between 12am and 2:30am, but I don't know what time he went to bed since I was in my room with the door closed the whole time and after I heard it the second time and what it sounded like I knew it wasn't my parents. I was wholly focused on the game I was playing and wasn't thinking about anything other than that so I know I wasn't psyching myself out when it started. I didn't feel any other sensations other than a steady eerie, creepy feeling.

I tried to brush it off the first few times, but it persisted. There were two times where after I heard it I saw a flash of white in the corner of my left eye. From where I was sitting it had to have come from my computer monitor, like a light suddenly reflected or my monitor fickered on for a split second, but my computer had been off all day and my monitor shuts itself off when there's no signal. I also had my main room light on so it was pretty bright in there so a flash would have had to have been really bright to see it. I didn't look in that direction to affirm anything because I didn't want to possibly see something I'd regret. I kept looking at the bottom of my door though, expecting black hair to start creeping under it at any moment.

Needless to say I didn't sleep at all that night. I didn't even leave my room to use the bathroom until about 8:30 when there was light out. I was worried a bit about my parents since their room is right next to mine, but I couldn't bring myself to open the door (real brave of me I know). Though I did hear them snoring a few times which made me feel better. I didn't hear anything Sunday or Monday night, but I still had to sleep with my lamp on to feel comfortable."
"Our Apartment","New York","Haunted Places","When I was 15 years old, I experienced this and told anyone who was within five feet of me. Some people laughed it off as fatigue due to my extremely busy lifestyle; I was a gymnast, a dancer, and my life was filled with travel and sleep-away camp. Other people who did believe me were afraid to come over my home after that or just avoided me. I know this is true and have spoken to a Priest and his advice did stop it although it took one week.

My adopted mother was from the U.K and wasn't a churchgoer. I at that time in my life was approached by many different people from lots of religions and an actual cult group that I actually wanted to join. My mother forbade me to join it because she told me that nothing good would come out of it for me. So, I avoided all of it but clung to my religion by birth, Catholic. 

One night I went to bed and nothing unusual happened that day so I don't know why this happened to me. My twin captain's bed is against the back wall with a window next to it and the radiator. I lie in my bed and felt an incredibly cold chill down my back. It lingered as if a cold body was lying in the bed with me. I knew the window was closed tight and felt afraid. I tried to get out of bed but I was frozen. At some point, I managed to get out and turned to look at my bed and the covers were still bubbled like a body was in the bed. I darted to the light switch by the door and turning it on I turned around to stare at my bed. The covers dropped and it was gone. I told my mother and of course she didn't believe it. 

After this happened, a few days later I was in my mother's bedroom watching television. I sat on her desk chair and to my left was her platform bed so you could see underneath it. While I was watching my program, I noticed a swirling effect under the bed. As I stared at it, it grew bigger swirling around as a black hole under the bed. I jumped off the chair and watched it not being able to scream. None of her furniture fell into the black hole. I left her room and was terrified about these events.

 The last thing that happened to me that week afterward was I woke up in the middle of the night with my mother standing over me with a blank face. She was just standing there like something else was inside her. Her eyes weren't there. I calmly told her to leave so I could sleep and slowly she turned and walked out of the room. 

Freaking out and knowing in my heart that something was evil in my apartment, I blocked my bedroom door so she couldn't come back in and slept on the floor away from the window. I went to the Catholic church the next day and in the confession booth, told him I needed help. I was given Holy Water in a bottle, a bible with passages circled, and a small wooden rosary. I was only 15, but I had to do this. I went around the apartment and did what he told me to do, and the worst place was my mother's bedroom. It felt like a resistance was coming from her room. I felt nauseous but kept throwing holy water in her room. After a few days of this, I still bolted past her room with fear. It never happened again but whenever I walked past her room over the years some days that fear welled up in me and I ran past her room afraid I would be pulled inside. 

I don't know why some days it made me feel like that but it was real. It happened to me and since then I have experienced more paranormal events that have made me question why me. They are always different events, and in different homes, I've bought. I'm grateful that none of these events rehashed themselves when my children and I visited my mother. Thanks for reading."
"My Dead Friend Visited Me","Arizona","Family / Friends Visits","One of my closest friends died in a freak accident a few years back. We had an extremely close bond despite only knowing each other a couple of years. I believe that this bond has transcended his death. I've had several unexplained experiences involving him since then. Here is my latest: 

I moved from the Midwest to Arizona earlier this year, and being so far from home, I naturally experienced some bizzare dreams and sleep patterns due to the stress of the move. This dream was different though. The first couple of weeks in my new place I found it easier to fall asleep on my new couch with the TV on. I put something random on Hulu or Netflix and fall asleep to it. This particular night, I checked the time before I fell asleep, it was 2:00am. 

Suddenly, I found myself sitting on the patio of a bar we used to frequent back home, facing my deceased friend. He looked as he always did in real life; jovial and confident with a cigarette in hand and cold Budweiser in front of him. I remember breathing in the menthol and distinct cold wetness of a Chicago fall. And because of this, I knew somehow I was home and it's really him. We sit and chat like old times, I can't remember the details of our conversation but he was happy and I felt distinctly he was there to check in on me. 

The weirdest part came when I woke up. I felt like someone was jostling my shoulder but I live alone. And when I jolted awake, it was only 2:30am. But it had felt like several hours had passed. Even weirder, the TV was off. A brand new TV. Fallen asleep many times since then to the TV, it hasn't turned off by itself once. I really feel that he came to me that night. Instead of waking up afraid I woke up feeling loved and grateful. So happy to see my friend again and know that he is proud of me and thinking of me still in the beyond."
"50 King Street","New York","Haunted Places","Some say that truth is stranger than fiction.

Back in our early twenties, Jerry and I found a one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan's West Village. We had been friends for a number of years, and as aspiring actors could not afford to rent alone. We would be subleasing from an artist named Lee Gatch.

 Near our move-in date we met with Lee Gatch at the 50 King Street apartment and signed the papers. He looked to be in his late-fifties, with a trim figure and a full head of gray hair. 

 Without a dining room, we sat at the kitchen table, in a small area at one end of the living room. 

 ""Do you have your own furniture?"" Lee Gatch asked.

 ""No,"" Jerry said, ""we've been looking for some.""

 ""My daughter lived here,"" he explained. ""She works for the airlines and has been transferred to Atlanta."" He took a moment to gaze into the living room, at the blanket chest at the foot of the Hollywood bed. Unless I misread the look, it appeared to carry a touch of dread. ""It's my furniture,"" he went on, ""so if you like, you can keep it until you move out."" 

 An offer Jerry and I could not refuse. Lee Gatch seemingly as pleased as we were. 

 ""Be kind to the furniture,"" he said. ""The blanket chest, mirror and dresser are from the Eighteenth-Century. Same with the dresser in the bedroom."" Then added, ""Whenever you're ready to move out, be sure to call me and I'll pick it all up.""

 The day we moved in, I chose the living room with the Hollywood bed to sleep on. Being an early riser it gave me easy access to the kitchen and bathroom without disturbing Jerry. 

 On our first night I lay ready for sleep. In the dimness of the room, my tired eyes made out a wispy cloud creeping across the old mirror that hung above the dresser. Soon as it had passed the mirror, it vanished. 

 In the morning, when Jerry came out of the bedroom, I told him what I had seen. He had a methodical mind; I trusted his analytical abilities. In bathrobe and slippers he approached the mirror and gave it a quick study. He then turned to the open blinds that covered the window between my bed and his bedroom. 

 ""Last night were the blinds open or closed?"" 

 ""Closed. I opened them around a half-hour ago."" 

 He went to the blinds. ""Maybe car lights bounced off the windows across the street and shone cloudy through the edge of the blinds and the window frame."" 

 ""And hit the mirror as the car moved slowly forward,"" I added in agreement, and that was that.

 A few months had passed when one night I turned the lights out and got into bed. I lay there whispering the lines I had learned for an audition. When ready for sleep I rose up and adjusted the covers. Something caught my eye at the foot of the bed, where the old blanket chest sat. Its lid rippled like pond water on a windy night. I thought I had gotten dizzy, sat forward and gazed at the lid - at the face of a woman with open dead eyes, hair splayed under the rippling water. 

 ""Jerry!"" I hollered.

 He rushed out of the bedroom. I turned to him, then flicked my eyes back to the chest - the image gone. 

 The lights on now, I told him what I had seen. In his robe he thoughtfully patrolled the room.

 ""You must have been asleep and dreamed what you saw. There's no other explanation."" 

 ""I was awake, sitting up when I saw it."" Thinking then that it would be useless to try to convince him. ""I don't know,"" I breathed, ""maybe your right.""

 ""Well, of course I'm right,"" he said with a yawn. 

 I kept the lights on and slept in stops and starts, sitting up occasionally to check the lid of the chest. 

 Another few months later I was falling asleep on my side, facing the open bedroom door. In the near-darkness, I made out Jerry in profile before the mirror of the antique chest-high dresser. He wore dark slacks, a white shirt with billowed sleeves and appeared to be putting on cufflinks. As I wondered why he was getting dressed with the lights out, he came toward me and stopped in the doorway. With tortured eyes he dropped to his knees, arms pleading toward me - it wasn't Jerry!

 ""No!"" I cried out. 

 The figure evaporated as Jerry leapt from his bed. He snapped the light on and came through the doorway. 

 I sat at the edge of the bed, voice shaking while I told him what I had seen: the tortured eyes, the figure pleading desperately. 

 ""Has to be another dream,"" Jerry said.

 ""Nightmare is more like it. But I saw it,"" I went on. ""I wasn't asleep - I know I wasn't.""

 I kept the lights on and stayed awake the rest of the night.

 A few weeks later Jerry and I entered our building with groceries. We stood waiting at the elevator. Jerry stepped across the lobby to where an eighteenth-century map of Manhattan hung. He studied it, then muttered, ""I've never read this."" He turned toward me. ""You ever read the fine print at the bottom of this map?""

 ""No, never noticed it,"" I said as I joined him there. Squinting, I read that on this property had stood George Washington's Manhattan wartime headquarters.

 ""Well,"" Jerry said, ""if you actually did see those ghostly things, this could be the reason.""

 ""You really think so?"" 

 ""No, of course not, but I have to admit this is quite a coincidence, and pretty creepy.""

 At the end of our year's sublease I called Lee Gatch and told him we would be vacating. Jerry and I were now able to afford our own apartments. 

 Lee Gatch came with movers to collect his furniture. He and Jerry and I sat at the kitchen table sipping coffee while the movers performed their chores. There was a lull in the conversation, Lee Gatch lost in thought, eyes on the old dresser under the mirror, then shifting to the blanket chest at the foot of the Hollywood bed. 

 ""In this apartment,"" he said hesitantly, ""did you ever see anything strange?"" 

 Jerry and I exchanged a glance. I answered, ""Yes, a number of times."" 

 ""When my daughter was little, she had her own bedroom and kept her toys in the chest. There were times she'd awake in the middle of the night and rush scared into our room. The reason was always because of the chest.""

 I told Lee Gatch about the face under the rippling water. Without any sign of surprise he said, ""In the late 1700's, my ancestors came here from the Isle of Wight. The chest was on their ship. Its legs had to be cut off so it would fit into one of the storage bins."" 

 Jerry asked, ""What would the legs being cut off have to do with the chest being haunted?"" 

 ""No idea,"" Lee Gatch said regretfully. 

 ""What about the mirror,"" I asked, ""the dresser under it, and the dresser in the bedroom?"" 

 ""They were aboard the same ship."" Then said, ""We kept them stored in our basement.""

 I had never seen Jerry so troubled. It was a dilemma for this particular man of methodology. 

 The three of us left the apartment and went down into the street. Where Jerry and I said our goodbyes to Lee Gatch. He drove off and Jerry said, ""Guess we can also say goodbye to the George Washington theory.""

 Some years later, Jerry's acting career had blossomed. Mine had not. We remained close friends while I worked at a small record store. It was a wintry evening when I arrived to relieve Brian. He had the newspaper open on the counter, reading his favorite section, the obituaries. We exchanged greetings as I went into the restroom where I hung my coat. As I did, I heard Brian call out, ""What do you know about that - Lee Gatch died!""

 Stunned by the news, I went to him. ""How do you know Lee Gatch?""

 ""Never heard of him,"" Brian said. ""Just thought I'd yell it out."""
"Something In The House With Us","Iowa","Haunted Places","This experience dates back 20 years ago to when I was only 8 years old. Still I can remember it better than I remember the hike I took with my dog yesterday. First to help paint a mental picture, this occured on an old farm in Iowa. Just outside of Sioux Center, if anyone knows where that is. My older brother and I had gone over to spend the night at a friends' farm. They have 4 kids total. One brother my age, one brother my brother's age, one younger sister and another older brother that wasn't at the house often. Specifically he wasn't at the house this night.

Fast forward to the night time. My friend and I had gone upstairs and my brother and his friend stayed downstairs in the living room with sleeping bags. The sister and their parents in their own rooms on the main level of the house as well. It was almost 1 a.m., my friend and I still hadn't gone to sleep. We were just staying up late talking, being kids. Then things got creepy, real fast. We both stopped talking and started listening to the hallway at the same time. Someone was pacing up and down the hallway, with some very heavy footsteps. We were kids and I'd never experienced anything supernatural at the time, so that thought never crossed my mind. I asked my friend if it could be his oldest brother for any reason. He assured me he wasn't home. So I sat by the door and waited until the footsteps were walking away from our room. I creaked the door open to see nothing in the hallway. The footsteps also stopped.

We were both understandably spooked, but I wasn't happy with just closing the door and calling it a night. Even though there was no way someone could have hid in time for me to not see them, I had to be sure. So I convinced my friend to go check it out with me. We left the room and down the hall toward where we last heard the footsteps going. There were maybe 5 steps down until the staircase took a 90 degree turn down to the main floor. As you went down the first few steps there was a window facing you. Most farms and acreages have one main yard light, and theirs was throwing enough light through this window to be able to see our way down the steps.

Of course I had to go first, even though my friend was a good sized farm boy and I was skin and bones. We crept down the stairs slowly and quietly, having no idea what we were in for. As soon as my foot touched the last step something significantly taller than me ran right in front of us, knocking me back into my friend on the stairs. It's footsteps were loud, like it was at a dead sprint. Even though it was only inches from us, neither one of us saw anything. It came from the left and ran to our right. The only thing to our left was the living room where my brother and his friend were sleeping. Whatever it was, it was standing over top of them while they slept.

My buddy had enough, he ran back upstairs to his room. I wanted one last look before I followed him. I grabbed the hand railing and leaned out to let my eyes adjust to the dark a bit more. I saw my brother and his friend sleeping in their sleeping bags to my left, but when I looked to my right where the thing ran off to... I saw something else in the yard. Through the windows I could see a man walking. He was walking underneath the main yard light so I could see him clearly. He had tattered clothes on, a baseball cap and a big sack slung over his shoulder that was full of whatever your imagination can think of. Other than the fact that it was 1:00 in the morning, this man seemed strange because his clothes, skin and even the bag over his shoulder were all a glowing gray color.

That's when I decided I'd seen enough and ran back to my friends room. First thing I did was look out his window, which faced the same direction that I'd seen this man outside. He was in the middle of the most open part of their yard when I saw him downstairs, however from the upstairs window there was no one outside. This homeless looking man with a giant sack over his shoulder either set a sprinting record across the yard to hide, or simply vanished underneath the yard light.

I've since experienced my fair share of paranormal events, sometimes going out looking for them. But I'll never forget the first encounter I had out at that farm house."
"A Lucid Dream, Or A Spirit?","Maryland","Haunted Places","I'm not sure if this counts as a lucid dream or a real encounter with a spirit, but it has been bugging me ever since it happened and I'd like to share with other people who might've had a similar experience.

I layed down for a quick nap while my boyfriend played video games a few feet away from me. As soon as I closed my eyes, I immediately went off into an identical version of my apartment. I was completely comfortable and didn't think twice of how I got there. I walked down my hallway into the bathroom and tried to turn on the light, but the light wasn't working. I backed up a little into the hallway, and saw an older woman with short grayish white hair right outside the bathroom, looking directly at me. She was pretty close to me, and hesitantly smiling at me. Not to sound cliche, but she was almost slightly see through as if she was a spirit. An overwhelming feeling came over me, my body felt light but there was a huge weight in my chest, and I wasn't sure if it was fear or happiness that I had possibly encountered someone from the other side. I looked over her shoulder and realized my boyfriend was still in the other room, and that gave me some comfort while I decided if she was harmless or malevolent. I smiled back at her and we stood there for a moment. Whatever I was feeling got VERY intense and emotional, and I snapped up back in my bed.

One of the reasons this has been bugging me so much is that usually when I dream (or lucid dream), my surroundings are altered a bit differently than the surroundings in my reality. But this is the first time the location I was at was completely identical. It was the same exact setting I was just in, with my boyfriend playing video games and everything. Also, the feeling that overwhelmed me was nothing I've ever felt before. I've been in this apartment complex for over a year and never experienced anything like this.

Ever since this has happened, I've been struggling to sleep. I have this feeling that someone is in the hallway, watching me at night. Was I simply just having an intense lucid dream, or was the lady I saw an actual spirit? I get goosebumps every time think about the whole thing."
"Felt Like A Message From My Mom","California","Family / Friends Visits","My mom died in March of 2010. Around Christmas time that year, I was online gift shopping, but started feeling mopey thinking about how Christmas wouldn't be the same without her, and my heart wasn't in it. A few hours later I took the bins down the driveway for pickup the next day. As I was walking back up the driveway, I saw a Polaroid photograph face down, and picked it up. It was a photo I'd taken of my son on Christmas Day when he was about 14 (about 11 or 12 years prior to this), smiling and handing a present to someone.

I was completely baffled, because it wasn't a photo that I'd ever carried in my purse, which might have fallen out on the driveway. It just lived with all my other photos, either in albums or desk drawers. As I looked at it, a message came through clear as day. I don't mean that I heard a voice or anything like that. But it was like a sudden understanding that my mom was telling me, 'You know how you are sad about Christmas without me, your mom? Well, *you* are a mom too, and you're important to my grandson, and his Christmas memories are going to involve you, just like your memories about me do.' It really was as if a light bulb went on in my head, and in that moment, I broke out of that quasi-dread about Christmas, and got more into a festive mood.

Even though I love hearing about possible paranormal stories, when it comes to myself, I always try to find a rational explanation. Not because I absolutely want it to be logically explained, but because I want to avoid talking myself into something, based on wishful thinking or something like that. But I've never been able to find a reasonable explanation for why any photo, let alone a Christmas one, landed face down on my driveway. So thought I'd share this, because even though it isn't technically a ghost story, it might help people who may be grieving a loved one look for signs like that, and feel hope that their loved one is still looking out for them.

Thanks for reading this, and stay well, everybody, in these crazy times."
"Things I Can't Seem To Explain 2 -it Hasn't Stopped","California","A Haunted Life","It has officially been 12 years since I posted last. Since then I have moved a handful of times, 4 additional cities, and even became a mother... And like the title says, it hasn't stopped. 

The last 4 years have probably been the most active. I became a single mother of a 1 year old and moved in to a newer 2 story house with a room mate and her 6 year old son, and my dog. We spent a lot of time together as a ""family"" supporting each other through some life changes. Our home had 4 bedrooms upstairs, and the ""living""/common spaces downstairs. 

Our experiences always happened when all of us would be downstairs. At first we wrote it off as possible raccoons or something making noise- but it kept getting louder. It started with hearing noises like something inside of the wall. Since we had just moved in, we contacted the landlord to check for rodents but were met with negative results. Other times we would all be downstairs (even the dog) and hear running back and forth in the hallway upstairs. Probably the most disturbing instance was when it sounded as if someone jumped off the top bunk of my friend's son's bed, landed hard, ran out of the room, then began running down the stairs. All of us- both my room mate and myself, both of our sons, and my dog all stopped what we were doing and just stared towards where the stairs ended in the next room waiting for something to show... Nothing ever did. After about 10 months my roommate couldn't handle it any longer and moved out... Things actually calmed down after that. 

A year later I moved across town and everything seemed quiet. I started having some strange experiences a few months after the move. I have been woken up from a dead sleep because I've felt someone touch my face or back. Once I woke up because it felt as if someone was directly next to my ear making almost an eating noise. 

My son can not sleep through the night in his own room. He will fall asleep there and come in to my room part way through the night. He tells me that people are too loud when they're talking and it keeps him up. At first I thought perhaps it was the neighbors, but we live in a very quiet cul de sac. He's not scared, he just can't sleep. He has started to draw our old house and it always has the stairs integrated in to the picture. He said it's so people can still visit since our new home doesn't have stairs. 

We have been in this home for almost 2 years and I've had to replace countless lightbulbs, experienced the tv turning on in different rooms or the channel changing. My niece (22) has come to visit and she says that she's heard things during the night that sounded as if things were moving or jingling. A few weeks ago she visited for the weekend. She said that each morning when she woke up her rings would be scattered all over the night stand like someone had played with them. 

I don't feel as if we are in danger. Previously I was always scared of the experiences. The ones in the last 2 years were more an ""inconvenience"" with the lack of sleeping in or through the night. My niece wants to sage the house and do a cleansing... I don't know how I feel about that right now. I don't want to anger or heighten anything. Does anyone have experience with saging or blessing? Is there a chance it could be done wrong and make things worse? Thanks in advance!"
"Three Animals And One Human Spirit","North Carolina","Haunted Places","My name is Audrey. I am 46 years old and started experiencing ghostly/spiritually things around my house. More in the bedroom than anywhere else. The way it feels to me is one human spirit (I can feel their hand holding onto my shoulder, then rubbing back and forth. I can even feel it laying down behind me with its hand on my side.) It really terrified me at first. Even had my doctor put me on medicine for hallucinations. Took medicine three weeks now. Still there. 

There is also the presence of I'm pretty sure it's three cats. I can actually hear one purring. I can feel the weight or pressure of another one lying on my leg in bed. At times when I wiggle my feet it will pounce on them. The third one walks up on my pillow around my head. The craziest thing about that one is if my eyes are open it won't come up on the pillow. It will turn around and go to bottom of bed. Then when I close my eyes it will come up on my pillow, walk around, then lie down next to my head. I will lay there and talk to them telling them it's safe here. Don't know if they understand me, but maybe they do. I have gotten accustomed to all of this, and feel like I would miss them now.

 I have been wanting to get this out so bad to someone who doesn't think I am crazy. I have to say the one thing that makes me a little uneasy is when the ghost takes its hands and cups the top of my head, then it gets hot. I can even still feel it after I get up. I believe this is real and that there's a reason it is happening to me. Thank you for taking the time to read my story. I really hope that there is someone who could help me understand all this a little better."
"A Haunted House In The Country","Connecticut","Haunted Places","This happened to me so long ago that any details might be fuzzy but it's to the best of my recollection. I was a freshman in a high school that combined two grade schools so I was meeting a lot of new people. I met Jade, who was a sophomore, and we bonded over our love of animals and her quirky sense of humor. She invited me to spend the night at her place to go to a party that Friday night, so I took the school bus to her house after class let out with a packed bag and a promise my mom would pick me up the next day. 

Jade's house was old. I can't say for sure how old but it was definitely from the 1800s. She lived there with her father, younger sister and brother and a cousin that lived in an elle that was closed off and had a separate entrance to the outside. Her mother had died of cancer when they were young. When we came in the front door of the main home, we walked into a parlor, which I had never seen before in my young life. It was decorated with fancy furniture, a piano and an old cathedral-style radio on top of the piano. The room had an air of disuse and a light layer of dust over it all. 

We crossed the parlor into the old kitchen by means of a swinging door that separated the two rooms. The kitchen held a decent-sized farm table in its center, and we threw our book bags down on the chairs. She offered me some PB toast as a snack and I happily agreed. As we toasted the bread, the radio in the parlor came on, full blast. It was LOUD. I don't recall the station that came in but it was very loud music. We went back into the parlor and there it was, the radio, all by itself with no one around. Her brother and sister were younger and in the middle school so were not home yet. She turned it off with some lame excuse that static turned it on. I supposed it was logical enough. Except as we turned to go back into the kitchen, the swinging door started moving like someone had just pushed it from the other side. We burst into the kitchen, expecting to see her prankster brother or even her cousin but no one was there.

I insisted we go see her cousin since there was no other logical explanation for what we were experiencing. We went outside, around the corner of this large farmhouse to the separated elle and knocked. Her cousin let us in, where he had been working on an electrical problem with some music equipment. He was a rather large guy and not the least bit out of breath, like someone who had just run off after a prank. He looked like someone that spent far more time watching TV than running anywhere, quite frankly.

Less than an hour later her brother and sister came in off the bus. They didn't say anything as I described what had happened. Jade and I went to the party that night, I slept over and nothing untoward happened overnight. However, the next day a strong smell of lavender filled the yard as we walked to meet up with some other friends. When I remarked on the strong smell with no lavender bushes in sight, she finally told me her house was haunted. She was afraid I wouldn't stay overnight if I knew. I asked if it was her mother and she shook her head. She told me that when they moved in they started feeling this female energy around them and that minor things happened around the house-things moved, that sort of thing. Nothing threatening at all. Her mother (before she passed) found a bottle of perfume that had been left behind by the previous family. It smelled of lavender."
"Baldur","New York","Pets / Animals","It's been over a year since I've been on here, submitting a story. Tissue warning. This is probably the hardest story I have written.

Since my last story I had been seeing an entity I thought was my grandfather or my father in-law. I soon realized that it could be neither because I wasn't getting that warm fuzzy feeling I get when either are around and I only saw it's back like it didn't want me to see it. I don't even know if the entity was male or female to be honest. 

My basement steps have no hand rails as my husband took them down years ago because the old ones were absolutely dangerous. I've asked my husband to put them back up since my back surgery last year. But he said it is easier to bring large things down into the basement without them. I had never fallen down the stairs and he really didn't want me down there too much, no more up and down those steps he would tell me. But that all changed soon after seeing this entity. 

One day I was about to go up the stairs and changed my mind because I needed something from the basement. I have been having a problem with my left knee for some time and it locked up on me when I tried to step down to the next step. I yelled for my husband because my back then locked up and I was in for a fall and I wanted him to try to stop me from falling. Rather than fall straight down the stairs which would have been preferable because I was on the 4th step from the bottom, I fell through where the handrail should have been. I don't know how I avoided hitting my head on a dresser that was in my fall path but at any rate I landed more than 6 from the basement stairs. My husband who just stood there asked me why I did that. I said I called you for help and because there was no handrail to stop my fall.

 A few other odd things happened the following week but I brushed them off. Then a week after my first fall on the stairs I was talking to my sons in the basement and when I was walking up the steps in my work boots the right boot slipped off of the steps and I went down on my belly until I again went flying through the hole and landed on my back more than 6 feet away from the stairs. There are too many things that I SHOULD have hit and should NOT have landed so far away from the stairs. My older son came running to help me up but I still was winded and hadn't moved yet. My other son and I have a way to pick me up if I fall, get knocked down by a dog etc. When I started to get around to moving he helped me up my older son made a nervous joke about how much air I got so maybe I landed further than I thought. Quite honestly it felt more like something pushed me the first time and something flipped me the second time. 

This all happened last May I think in the middle of the month because it was still chilly. The last week in May was the start of a bad heat wave. All of my dogs were panting like crazy because they had not yet shed their winter coats fully. Baldur was 145 pounds, Kaia, his mom weighed 150, his brothers were Otter 138, & Moose 135. Dad, Loki was 100. Baldur rarely showed his puppy side but was hysterical when he did. He was panting heavier than the others and I wanted to take him to the vet (I can't take any of the dogs to the vet by myself because of my back) but my husband told me he was just bigger, the next day he was worse and came up to me and buried his head into my lap which for those who don't know is one way of dogs letting you know they don't feel well.

 He started coughing the next day. I called my husband and informed him that I was going to take Baldur to the vet. Again he told me to wait, so I agonized. Friday my husband came home early and I thought he would take Baldur to the vet, no he said he would bring him in Saturday morning.

 I knew this dog was close to death and all I could do is cry. My adult children and I stayed up all night worrying about him. Around 4 A.M. He let out a loud yelp, coughed, then collapsed fluid coming out of his mouth. My husband had hurriedly gotten dressed to take him to the Emergency Vet. When he came out I angrily told him he was too late Baldur was gone.

 Later that morning I called my vets office to see if they would take care of his remains. I have been a client of theirs for almost 34 years so they were very accommodating, I asked to talk to a vet and they told me that Mike a vet tech would talk to me. I told him all of the symptoms including a high fever. He said that Baldur presented with congestive heart failure and even if I had gotten him there by Thursday there would be nothing they could do. I looked angrily at my husband and said that at the very least we could have had him humanely euthanized.

My son does a warding prayer every night and I also do so when I get bad feelings. My last story was about being in a sort of limbo when I had my last back surgery and I felt like I was floating towards my families voices to come home but something felt like an anchor and it pulled me back. When I kept seeing that being and had those two weird falls I felt like death may have been around because death is neither good nor evil so no amount of warding could keep it out. When it failed to get me I feel it took Baldur because the being left after Baldur died.

"Alcatraz","Missouri","Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels","While visiting California in May, 2019 my fiancé and I went to Alcatraz. We took the morning self-guided tour. While walking down one of the cut through areas between cell blocks, I heard in my right ear very clearly someone say ""Hey there"". I asked my fiancé if he had heard it and of course he had not. I really felt as though I had a paranormal experience at that moment.

 We also went to the Winchester Mystery House, and The Hurst Castle. We took numerous photos looking for orbs and such, but never got a thing on our cameras. We took photos at Alcatraz as well, but nothing showed up there either. When we got home from our vacation I told everyone I knew about my experience. Then basically forgot about it.

 Today, in March of 2020, I ran across this website and read where numerous others have heard basically the same thing, in different areas of the prison. Either this is an elaborate hoax by the prison to make people keep coming back, or it was real. I choose to believe it was real. It felt real, and I think your gut tells you the truth 100% of the time. I wish more had happened, but I am grateful for what did. If I was chosen to be spoken to then I guess he liked me!:) I would enjoy taking an evening tour sometime later and see if that would provoke more interaction. I hope I get some feedback from this story. I would like to know if anyone thinks this is just a set up of random headsets to make people think something is really happening to them, or do you think it is in fact a ghost speaking to people and always saying the same thing to all of them? That is the part that makes me a bit skeptical. Would love all the replies I can get about this."
"Living Next To 'the Devil's Nest'","Virginia","Haunted Places","My husband, Sean, and I as newlyweds relocated to a little house in Weber City, Va. In January 2014. We were so excited to move into this house as we were leasing to own. My mom assisted us in the move and we couldn't have been prouder of being ""home-owners"". It was such a beautiful little starter home it was located practically at the base of a mountain in the woods, located on the Trail of Tears.

 Within the first week the activity began. I was training as a CNA at a local nursing home in the area, and I got up early one morning as I had been for my classes. It was around 5:30 in the morning and I was in the bathroom blow drying my hair with the door open. It was a small bathroom so I left the door open so I wouldn't get hot. As I held my head upside down and tousled my hair and the dryer around I caught a glimpse of someone in an old timey pioneer woman dress float directly next to me into my bedroom. Confused and not understanding what I had just seen, I stopped what I was doing and walked into the bedroom where my husband was sleeping. I couldn't explain what had just happened. I was at a total loss for words.

 I mentioned what had happened to friends and family and most just laughed. When I told my mother she mentioned to me that the house next door had been on a paranormal television show and supposedly it was known for being extremely haunted. I laughed it off and didn't think much of it. I was wrong to ever act so nonchalant.

 We found out we were pregnant with our first born, Harper, shortly after moving into the home. Things were great for awhile, we had a baby on the way, I had decided to take time off and stay home while pregnant. One night I remember my husband had went to sleep before me, I was sitting in the living room watching TV and we had 3 dogs at the time and I whistled for them to come out of the bedroom and come into the living room with me. I whistled and all of a sudden I heard a whistle right back. I got up and walked to the bedroom to see if my husband was awake and he was fast asleep. I got that eerie feeling like someone was watching me and stayed up most of the night.

 There were many moments in the home where you would hear people speaking in the house very low, I can only explain it like a diner and how it can be during an early morning rush, multiple conversations just going non stop. We could hear it all throughout the night while we laid in the bed and attempted to sleep. My husband was a bit of a skeptic prior to living in this house. You could also lay in our bed at night and see shadows speed from the dining room to the living room. It got to be quite disturbing at night when we laid down and we both just thought our eyes were playing tricks on us. The activity was fairly frequent, but nothing too extreme at first. Now I know seeing someone walk by me is pretty extreme, but not when you lived in this house. Eventually we got pregnant again with Charlotte, and became a family of four. My husbands cousin, Thomas, needed a place to stay and moved in with us. We joked with him about the house next door being haunted and told him about the weird things that occurred in our home. 

My husband being the practical joker he is, thought it'd be funny to buy a Satanic bible and read and poke fun at the things in it. He likes to taunt people or things on occasion. One night he decided he'd go next door and ""summon"" whatever was in that house to come to him. No one was living in the home at that time, usually the residents didn't last longer than a few months. As soon as he got done summoning whatever it was in that house, he became violently ill and ran back home getting sick in the yard. After that things went downhill!

 There were times when you could go outside and see the light randomly come on upstairs in the house next door and no one was there. We know this because my husband and his friend went over to find out if someone was there, they knocked for a while and no one came to the door. They came back to the porch and the light went off. It was so strange.

 We went back in our house and came back out to smoke about 30 minutes later and the light came back on. We would see shadows all the time outside as well. So much just kept going on. 

After the Satanic Bible incident, my husband, myself, and the girls were asleep in the bed. I remember waking up feeling someone's hands touching me inappropriately and I thought it was my husband. I remember laughing and saying stop, when I opened my eyes I was looking at him with both of the girls laying on and against him. I immediately froze in fear and went catatonic. I couldn't move, I couldn't speak, I couldn't do anything! I remember feeling the tears running down my face and with everything in me I KNEW SOMEONE WAS BEHIND ME! It's like I was screaming in my head for my husband to wake up, but nothing came out! Finally it's like whatever was touching me released me and I shot up crying. I was so shook by that moment. I had never had anything like that happen to me. I felt so violated. My husband being my husband, just laughed and assumed I had been dreaming and poked fun at me about it. 

I label the next incident as THE BIG NIGHT, because it was just that. One night my husband, his cousin, and myself were hanging out. The girls were already in bed. We were up late and it was so cold outside. I remember having to wear a jacket when I went outside and smoked and I could see my breath it was that cold. I came back in from the back porch after smoking and looked out my dining room window toward the ""haunted"" house. In the yard they had a concrete table and bench, and to my surprise in the freezing cold there were 3 people sitting at the table and a lantern was lit over their head. A tall man and his face was so distorted, I couldn't make it out, he was wearing overalls and kept shaking oddly. A dark blonde woman and an old woman in a long black robe or dress. Now I wouldn't have thought it too strange, but the lantern was just hanging in mid air from nothing and it was freezing cold outside and they were just sitting there. 

I shouted for my husband and his cousin, another skeptic, and they both were shocked and in disbelief. We couldn't believe our eyes. I ran to the back porch and looked at the table and no one was there, I thought I was going crazy. I ran back in and there they were again. I went to my front porch and I could still see them. Again, back to the back porch and they were gone. It's like the only place I could see them was from my dining room and front porch. My husband's cousin, Thomas, was in shock and refused to look anymore and went back into the living room scared of what he was seeing. I remember asking him, ""Are you seeing this?! The same thing I'm seeing?"" He replied ""Yes, but I don't want to admit it to myself."" I waved at the people sitting there and they waved back. I did this frequently throughout the night, until finally around 4 am the blonde female flipped me off. At around 6:00 they disappeared it was the craziest thing I had ever seen and I've never seen anything like it since.

 One day the woman that owned the house next door came over and asked my husband if he could help change the locks on her house, because new people were moving in. He went over and helped and she's preceeded to tell him her brother had lived in the house and practiced the occult and was into some pretty heavy stuff. He had Parkinson's and always wore overalls. He immediately thought of the man we'd seen that night sitting at the table outside. She then told him her brother shot himself upstairs in the middle of a pentagram. My husband was very disturbed by this. We both swear it was her brother we saw that night at the table outside.

 We lived there for a few years and it was almost like the place was draining our relationship. Turning us against one and other and causing severe damage to our marriage. We decided to part ways and I relocated to North Myrtle Beach, SC to be closer to my mother who had moved down a year after I moved into that house. Leaving that house was the best decision we ever made. My husband and I reconciled and are happier than ever here in South Carolina with both of our girls.

 One evening we were watching tv and this show pops up on Hulu called Paranormal State. An episode labeled the Devils Nest comes on. That's episode 20 season 3. We began watching and we were shocked by what we were seeing as they drove up our old road, our old hill, you could see our house as they pulled into the driveway of the house next door and began their investigation of the Devils Nest. My husband was in shock and stated that this just put everything together he'd experienced, because he'd wrote it off as he was going crazy. One scene in the show the resident states she was sexually assaulted by something there and that made things just come together for me. My husband was at that point in shock and dismay by what had actually happened to me. We both feel for whoever lives in either house, because we don't feel like it's the houses. We feel like it's the land and it has a permanent stain that will never be lifted.

 I'm so glad we moved away from there, but we will always remember the horrible and shocking events that happened while living there."
"After My Sister Passed","Texas","Family / Friends Visits","My sister passed about 25 years ago. She was 35 and had breast cancer. The last 5 days or so of her life, she started speaking to my grandmother who had passed about 10 years earlier. This was my dad's mom. I will say, she was heavily medicated and said some very strange things but the consistent things she said were about my grandmother. The last 2 days or so of her life she could see grandma. I was alone with her and asked her what grandma wanted and she stated, "" to help me on my journey."" I found this interesting so I told her when it was my time I wanted her (my sister) to come for me. She then told me, ""I don't know, I'll try, but there's an order here."" During this time of my life I absolutely did not believe in any ghosts or paranormal things because of the church I belonged to. I thought any ghosts or spirits were demons. 

A few weeks after my sister passed I started to dream about her. I didn't understand or believe these were ""visitations"" from her literally but have come to understand it now. I've always been a ""dreamer"". These dreams were so vivid and over the years I've had many. None of the dreams were bad and some were quite beautiful. She let me know she was well and there were dreams where I was able to ask her questions. Not sure this is the place to post them though. 

My dad passed about 10 years ago and he's also visited me in my dreams. I had one dream where I got to tell him I missed and loved him and he told me he missed and loved me too. I've not had near the dreams about him that I've had about my sister. I believe this is because her passing was much more tragic due to her age and leaving 3 small children behind. My dad had a wonderful attitude about passing and told us he lived a great life. He passed suddenly and we were glad he didn't linger and suffer like my sister. I wish he could tell me if she was there to greet him like grandma was for her.

My hope is to someday speak to a reputable medium and possibly connect with her and my dad.

Thank you all for reading this. I know there's many thoughts and beliefs about dreams but I believe there are a multitude of reasons behind our dreams."
"What Made Us Believe In The Paranormal","Tennessee","Haunted Places","Give you a little back story. I'm a disabled veteran and was recently diagnosed with diabetes and had to start exercising. I had watched a lot of YouTube and decided since I'm having to walk a lot how about filming it since I'm walking. My problem was what was it we were going to upload? 

 We are really big into abandoned and historical locations. So we just started exploring different abandoned places. Then as I started editing we started hear things we couldn't explain. At which point we decided to put focus on the Paranormal while we are exploring. We didn't believe in the Paranormal and always try to explain it way.

 Then the day came when we explored this old abandoned house and we couldn't explain what happened. Everything was like normal when we started walking up to the house. However, when we opened the back door and stepped into the back of the house, we got an overwhelming feeling of dread. At which time my wife and I started whispering. 

 If you watch our videos we normally don't whisper like that. I first walked into the dining room and then my wife stepped up and as soon as she did she didn't want to be there. She felt like something bad was in there. I kind of blow it off and walked around the first floor talking to the camera. 

 Once I finished the bottom floor I walked up to the 2nd floor to explore. As I walked up the old oak floor steps they creaked loudly and sent a shiver down my spin. I then finish explore the 2nd floor and came down the stairs. 

 At that time I decided to do the outro at the bottom of the steps due to the old spindles on the stairwell to have them in the shot. Then as I finished my outro we heard a loud ""Bang"", so loud it made me turn and look. I thought someone was either falling down the stairs or running down the stairs at me. 

 We then kind of freaked out cause we never experienced anything like that before. Then as we were running out of the house and got to the side of the house, something/someone was banging hard on the side of the house. 

 Then as we came around to the front of the house we looked up and seen a curtain blowing out the window. We just couldn't explain what was happening and we ran off. 

 After we got back to our car, I review the video to see what happened. Then, as I'm watch my wife step up into the dining room and turned to the right to look at an old furnace you hear clear as day ""Leave"". 

 The voice itself was an old woman with a raspy voice. Kinda sounded like a person who smoke for 70 years Then when we got to the part where we heard the bang, I played it back so many time and still to this day can't explain it. 

 This was the turning point for us and made us believe in the Paranormal. We still try to explain what the noises are we hear in our videos but we watch them back with an open mind now. Thank you for your time in reading this."
"The Spirits Of Cold Harbor","Virginia","Haunted Places","Virginia is full of history, especially that of the civil war. One of the most bloody called Cold Harbor. Located in Mechanicsville, Cold Harbor Battlefield is where ""one of American history's bloodiest, most lopsided battles"" occurred. It was a part of Union General Ulysses S. Grant's Overland Campaign, also known as the Wilderness Campaign. Though the strategic operation included many raids and skirmishes, the Battle at Cold Harbor was particularly disastrous and grisly. Grant himself would later reflect:

""Cold Harbor is, I think, the only battle I ever fought that I would not fight over again under the circumstances. I have always regretted that the last assault at Cold Harbor was ever made.""

A priest who was at the battle, Winthrop Phelps, confirms:

""You cannot conceive the horror and awfulness of a battle. I never wish to hear another much less see it. I went out to see this but found myself in such danger I soon fled... Pray for me. I cannot write - am not in a fit state of mind.""

 June 3rd was an especially devastating day; in under an hour, around 7,000 of Grant's men were slaughtered. On a blood stained diary entry, one Union soldier wrote: ""June 3. Cold Harbor. I was killed.

My reenacting unit used to do living history at Cold Harbor very frequently. We were allowed to camp over by the Garthright house and when people would stop by, they'd ask questions about us, Cold Harbor and questions in general about the war. 

One particular night about 10 of us had laid down for the evening, it was a full moon, and chilly. I was awoken by the sound of clanking, sort of like the sound of a tin cup banging on a canteen or haversack buckle. I had to use the bathroom anyway so I went to see what I could find. I walked back the gravel path about 40 feet, and the sound got louder and louder. I could then faintly see a campfire, and what seemed to be two reenactors sitting around it. I thought it was odd due to the fact fires aren't allowed on Federal property. I walked closer, I noticed that the two men were talking and were drinking from their tin cups. They were union soldiers, and had their muskets stacked together, both men were sitting on crates.

 I walked closer and called out, ""hey there"". No response... I called out again, ""hello""... Both men stopped what they were doing, almost like they were frozen in time, they then turned and looked at me. They stared at me in a strange way, like I have never been looked at before. I then saw something I wish I'd never seen, the men were wax like, white pale skin and their eyes seemed hollow, as if there were no eyes... One of the men stood up and then pointed at me. The other turned and half of his face was shot away, like he'd been hit by a shell and his face exploded! I turned and ran so fast I almost tripped.

 I woke my fellow reenactors up and told them they had to come see what I had experienced. They reluctantly came with me and I guided them to the site where I had seen the men, I was rambling like a madman trying to explain the whole story as fast as I could. When we arrived,...nothing. No sign of a fire, men or anything. Most of the guys thought it was a joke and went back to camp. My Sgt. Bill believed me. He said,""I have been coming here for many years and I tell ya, I have seen some strange things too.""

 I reluctantly stayed the night but didn't get a wink of sleep. The next morning I went to where I saw the two specters and there was nothing there. If you ever go to the Garthright house, walk the path to the left in the visitor area. Maybe you will see two union soldiers still stuck in purgatory..."
"Spooked While Pregnant","Texas","Haunted Places","My spouse and I just moved into our new space and I found out I was already more then a couple weeks pregnant. I ignored my spouse when he said he was encountering any paranormal activity in the place because I actually thought he was making the stuff up. He said he was feeling a presence and would hear random noises but I thought whatever, yeah right.

 Then just this past week I felt something swipe my left foot with the covers over and it woke me up. Then another day it actually swiped my left foot again and I didn't have the cover so I actually felt like a swipe with a single finger or stick. It was definitely alarming because it reminded me of the first time.

 Then just tonight not even an hour or so ago my spouse went outside to have a smoke and I was in relaxing on the couch reviewing my pregnancy app when all of a sudden I turn to the window and see that one of the blind pieces was cracked just a peek right. But then I kept staring because then I noticed I couldn't tell that the blind piece kept going up and I was only able to see that there was more and more open space in between the blinds. I instantly called for my spouse outside and was shocked full of nerves to my stomach when he came in and I even screamed. I'm still spooked and now I don't want to live here pregnant. My body can't handle fighting off any paranormal activity whatever forces that was.

 My spouse said he keeps hearing someone make a huffing frustrated sound and it's coming from the same window I told him about and him seeing the blind more up also. So we're not crazy we're pregnant and don't have time for this."
"The Daycare's Guardian Ghost","Mississippi","Haunted Places","I'd like to start off as saying I've always thought the paranormal, and ghosts were tv and hollywood made up nonsense.

I work part-time at a local daycare ran by a family friend while taking night classes. For the family friend's privacy I won't say the name of the daycare.

The first day I started working was fun I love kids and enjoy spending time with them.

There was something odd though (I'm not using her real name) Ann a four year old kept talking about someone called big bro yet when I asked, her parents she was an only child I passed it off as an imaginary friend and forgot about it.

The first I guess you'd call paranormal event happened back in November. It was cold so the heat was on constantly, yet when I would walk into the playroom it was cold. I checked the vent incase it was covered but I could feel heat coming from the vent then I checked the window it was completely shut.

I walked back in a few hours later to clean up the kids' toys and it was warm like the other rooms.

A few days later I was checking in on the baby's while, they were supposed to be napping but some are little escape artistes 

I opened the door and saw Bobby (not his real name) he was half way over the side of the crib when I caught him he froze or got scared and let go of the rail.

The distance between his crib and the door is rough 14 feet I ran for him but the really freaky part is he stopped mid air halfway to the floor. Then he was lowered onto the floor I grabbed him and, ran out of that room. I went to (not her real name) Emily and told her what happened.

 She said,"" Relax dear that's just Chris."" I was dumbfounded she acted like it was normal. I guess the look of disbelief showed and then Emily went more into detail. She said Chris worked here for years making the kids happy but a few months before I started he passed away due to an asthma attack. 

The kids loved him and had taken to calling him big bro. They can see him because they are so young and innocent he helps out still even after passing away. 

She told me on occasion she can still see him playing with them; a baby would be giggling up a storm and they were alone, a block would lift up by itself or the rocking chair he'd read to them in would rock by itself.

I have seen similar things since our chat one time I was trying to comfort one of the babies while they were fussy. I tripped over a toy and fell back I wrapped the baby up and got ready for the pain but I never hit the ground.

I was pushed back up and I heard whistling like a lullaby the baby calmed down. The kids still say they see their big bro and I've walked into the playroom to clean up and all the toys are already put away.

 I feel fortunate that my first run in with the paranormal has been such a positive one."
"Spiritual Copying Of A Sibling","Arizona","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","When I was 16. I recently started living with my mom in this apartment complex in Phoenix. I was sleeping on the couch and woke up to a cat cry. My mom's door was open and I could see from the room where I was sleeping. My mom's ex boyfriend, Marcus had accidentally stepped on the our cat Sandy's tail. As I faintly am waking up I see a silhouette of my brother walking out of the room and even spoke with a sarcastic attitude, as usual. He said "" nice job"". Towards the fact he hurt the cat then he walked out of the room to the bathroom (which had the light on already). My mom and her ex then walk out and say they are going to do some errands and leave me with my brother... At least I thought. 

So 30 minutes after they leave. I have to pee super bad, so I'm waiting for my brother to get out of the bathroom and an hour later he still in there. I thought he's going to get out he probably has a bad stomach or he's shaving. 30 minutes later the door finally opens and the light is on and everything. I was so happy cause I was holding it for almost an hour and a half. But it was strange because he wasn't coming out when it opened. Then all the sudden the door closed back up and got locked. And I was furious I even yelled "" dude I gotta pee!"" I'm a trooper so I kept holding it. After another 30 minutes my mom came home and she went in her room to lie down. At this point I was mad and finally got up to go kick my bro out. I went to the bathroom and I knock, but no answer. I open the door preparing for the worst because I don't know what I'm walking in on, gross. But then I open it and no one was in there the whole time. I went to the bathroom mad and freaked out cause I was confused and I held my pee for 2 hours straight. 

I went to ask my mom"" where the hell is Gabe I thought he was in the bathroom! I had to pee for 2 hours.""

She just stared at me and told me. "" Uh Gabriel never came home last night. His bike is not even here"". I checked and yeah his bike was gone. I literally a had a spirit make me hold my pee for 2 hours. I never heard of a spirit copying a appearance of a person you know but that was the first time I've experienced something like that. 

The scary part about it was it knew I was waiting and it even opened the door to make me think that my brother was there. It was just really freaky - something like that can outsmart you or even mess with you. As silly as the story sounds it was creepy and very memorable when your waiting for 2 hours to pee so focused on the bathroom. Have you've ever seen a ghost that can pretend to be someone you know? I would love to know about it and why if you have info on this. (Please excuse my grammar if I've made any mistakes.)"
"Our Strange House","Connecticut","Haunted Places","In my first post I briefly mentioned how my family has a history of weird happenings. When I was younger these were all confined to my father's side of the family. I don't see him anymore but both me and my mother are still close to his mother, my grandmother.

Grandma would have frequently kept me entertained with tales of our family's haunted past. I never took them seriously but still enjoyed listening. My mother never really approved of these stories but also didn't see the harm in what she believed were either tall tales or stories with simple explanations. To her credit, mom was always able to offer an explanation to any story I relayed from grandma.

We moved into our current house about five years ago and this was when I started encountering some weird stuff.

The house was a big project for my mom and one I remember she was very excited about. She had bought it at auction with a view to renovating it fully. The house was in such bad shape it was a few months after purchase before it was even habitable for us. When we moved in, work was still ongoing. I have no idea of the history of the house other than it's old. My grandma remembers a family living there when she was a teenager so that gives some idea just how long it's been in the neighbourhood.

A few days after we moved in I began hearing footsteps at night. The floor of the landings on the first are second floor are old wood and creak with the slightest bit of pressure. To my ears, the sound was unmistakable, like someone was walking across the halls with heavy shoes. Each time I checked there was nothing there. 

At first my mom wrote it off as simply the sounds an old house makes and then as my overactive imagination fuelled by grandma's stories. She wasn't cruel about it and never said she didn't believe me but she has always been a sceptic, even after the incident on the road that I wrote about in my first story.

The footsteps were never constant. Within a few weeks they had stopped almost altogether. 

A couple of months later, I think in March or April, I was in my bedroom and I heard a door slamming downstairs. My mom shouted up to me, warning me about being gentle with the doors and I had to tell her I was upstairs and nowhere near the door that had somehow slammed shut on its own. The house is old but by then had proper insulation so it would not have been draughty enough for a breeze to slam it shut and there was no wind outside.

Around this time I started hearing the footsteps again. One night I believe I saw a figure dressed in grey flash past my room. As with the footsteps I couldn't find the owner despite going immediately into the hall. Over a number of months when I was sitting with my mom, I thought I could see someone out of the corner of my eye looking in her direction. The figure would be there for a split second and then be gone when I turned my head.

Things like this have happened on and off since we moved in. My mom has often experienced things without noticing them or writing them off as something innocent, including being tapped on the shoulder while in the kitchen despite being home alone or thinking that she heard someone whisper from behind her or breathe on her neck. On at least two occasions she has taken off her watch, a large gold Michael Kors, only to find it has been moved to another room when she went to put it back on.

The attic in the house is somewhere I never go. Although I have never thought that anything in the house would do me harm, the attic creeps me out. It has a heavy feeling to it. There is a lot of cool stuff up there though. Old furniture that the previous owner left behind and we kept. My mom loves it and has restored some of it.

Her latest project was an old dressing table and after a lot of prodding I agreed to help her move it downstairs. It was a normal winter day. Cold outside but our house is always warm. Even so, there was a notable temperature drop as soon as we walked into the attic.

Mom went over to the table and put both hands on it. She gasped as soon as she touched it and both her hands seemed to jump away from the table as if pushed. Before I could do anything she had somehow been knocked to the ground. She didn't move and her eyes were closed. It took me a few seconds to realize she had fainted.

She came to within a few seconds, maybe twenty, although it felt like longer. She remembers touching the table and then waking up with me looking over her. She was very embarrassed and explained that she must have fainted. I accepted this and it's only now after posting my other story that I'm thinking there's more to it. The way she seemed to get shoved away from the table as if someone had pushed her was unnatural.

As with everything in the house, mom sees the simple explanation; that she had simply fainted. 

As with the incident on the road, her watch had also stopped but I guess that could be explained by her fall."
"Katie My Dear With The Bow Come Home","South Dakota","Pets / Animals","This story is about my beloved cat, Katie, she was a darling, she wore an velvet pink bow collar, and an pink velvet harness with an bell, (no I did NOT walk her, I just put it on her when she went outside, just in case she got lost and her collar fell off, so people knew she had an lovely home) I had her since 2000, she was very old and perfectly healthy, until her death in 24/12/2019, sadly she died Christmas eve.

I actually brought her 2 presents, an fish wand with catnip in it, and an soft cat toy that looked like an fish with catnip in it, she would have loved them, but she never got to play with them, she died of nothing, but old age. She died peacefully in her sleep, it was the worst Christmas ever, I was crying my head off. On Christmas day, once I finished giving my family their presents and they gave me mine, there was still one present left.

The name tag said to ""kayleh"" from ""katie"" I started crying and asked who did it, but they all said they did not, I opened it and I saw Katie's velvet collar, velvet harness with a bell and the fish wand and fish plush I brought her, there was an photo of her, that I never took, it had writing on the back it read ""hi kayleh, please don't cry, I can only be with you in ghost form, I shall see you tonight. From katie your beloved maine coon"" I cried and asked who did it.

Nobody had done so. I ran to my room and grabbed a pin from the pot and hung the photo up and stared at it, her blue eyes, tannish brown fur on the top half of her face, the white mouth and white bottom part of her face, her tufts of white hair on the tip of her ears, I cried for hours, and then fell asleep, I dreamt of Katie.

Katie was on my bed meowing, and then spoke, I remember exactly what she said ""hi, kayleh, I will stay with you forever in ghost form. I love you"" she was wearing her velvet harness and collar, and then I woke up to a familiar meow.

It was Katie! I sobbed, she had her velvet collar and harness on, I smoothed her but she was cold, but she rubbed my hand and she was purring, this is the first time I saw her when she was dead.

I continue to see her everyday, this is 100% true, I sob everytime I see her, my friends or family don't believe me so I posted it here, her name was similar to mine."
"The Battle To Come","Michigan","Haunted Places","I like day trips, just getting in my mustang and driving. This weekend in December 2018 I decided I'm going to the Hofbrauhaus German Restaurant in Cleveland and since I'm going I might as well explore the local legend of the Rockefeller gravesite.

 In Lakewood Cemetery, Rockefeller is buried with a few relatives besides an obelisk baring his name. Local legend says that if you leave a dime on the monument wealth will come your way. Ya, something came my way. Almost immediately my significant other tells me a spirit followed me home. I don't know if this singular trip to this cemetery was the catalyst for haunting 2 hours away in Michigan.

 I have never been a believer, but too many times has a spirit bothered either me or my girl.

 I was sleeping on the couch one time only to awake and start throwing punches at a dark figure hovering near my head just before my sweetheart enters the apartment. One time late at night coming in from work and the apartment is pitch black, I walk right into the apartment and for no real reason I side step as if avoiding walking into something. I did a double take after I turn on the lights trying to figure out why I did the previous maneuver.

 My love reports to me that since Cleveland, the bedroom is occupied by a shadow person. She sees it from the living room and would close the door to the room until it's time to sleep. She is a street smart and tough person from Detroit not given into artistic inclinations and sleeps in the bedroom even though a ghost is in there... Even if it scares her. Even her friend broke down shaking from seeing a ghost in the hallway beside the bedroom door.

 I've put up crucifixes at the main door, the bathroom door and the bedroom in the summer of 2019. The disturbance has been reduced or taken a less scary approach. Until now...

 This past week in February 2020, something different has been haunting the bedroom. I've woken up again throwing punches into the air. A darker force that has my girl sleeping scared under the blankets because she doesn't want to see the ghost. After she told me of her recent experience, I told her mine so as to comfort her that it's not just her and admit I slept with the light on hinting she does the same while I'm working over night.

 I'm thinking that I need to spend more time taking possession of the room. Lay down some sage and holy water."
"Red Eyes!","New Jersey","Non Human Entities","I'd like to say, that I am pretty disturbed about my subject and since the internet has come about, I have been looking for some kind of answer to explain what I saw and to this day no one seems to have an answer! I see that some people (very few) have seen almost exactly what I saw but, that is where the experience ends. No answer!

 I grew up in Southern New Jersey about 3 miles or so from Fort Dix Army Base in the 70's in a small town (Country Lakes). Growing up here everyone around knew that the woods here are very scary and more so at night! As a kid, my friends and I were always running through the woods or driving down the dark dirt roads of The Pine Barrens at night and it became almost normal to hear that someone heard or saw something unexplainable. I heard many stories from people but, I never saw anything...Until!

 It was around 1978 and I was 10 years old. During the summer, my best friend at the time and I came to my house after running around outside and it was already dark out, probably around 9:00 pm. My friend lived right next door to me and our houses were up against the woods in the back yards. After playing, we went to my backyard and sat on the deck with our feet hanging over the side and were small talking because it was time for him to go home soon.

 As we are sitting in the dark, I happened to look over to my right, say the one or two 0'clock position and to my SURPRISE, I saw two large glowing red eyes staring straight at us! Now these eyes were about 8 or so feet high from the ground and not a normal height for a person. The second thing, these eyes were large! I would say they seemed to be the size of a tennis ball and that was from a distance of around 30 yards. I can best describe the color as almost the same color as a brake light from a car, the same type of glow! It also looked like there was a small black pupil in the middle.

 Whatever this was, it didn't move at all and it made itself very obvious the way it was just staring at us! Another thing I noticed is I could see no body and no face! There was no outline at all but, it was very dark. This thing was standing right at the edge of the tree line and my back yard.

 So, as I glanced over and saw this, I became VERY scared and my reaction was to swing my left arm and hit my friend to get his attention and point to the obvious! I was so scared I didn't speak just reacted! This entire moment was literally only a few seconds! As my friend saw this, we both shot up and ran as fast as we could into my house! When we got inside we went straight to the back window and saw these eyes leaving through the woods like it was running and you could see the eyes going in a flowing motion up and down like it was flying but, the woods were to thick for that! What I saw was not human and huge! And I'm now 50 years old and I believe I will never know what the hell this was! This is the first time I have ever told what I saw publicly!"
"My Grandma's Ghost","Colorado","Family / Friends Visits","Hey everyone! Just like a lot of you, I've been reading stories on here for a while, but I eventually decided to write my own story because I think it's very interesting and very sweet. This happened Christmas Eve 2017.

 Ever since I was a little kid, I've been sleeping out in the living room on Christmas Eve because I've always wanted to catch Santa. I don't necessarily believe in him anymore, but I still keep up the tradition because it's just what I've always done and it would feel extremely weird to not be sleeping on the couch on Christmas Eve. Anyway, I was facing the back of the couch, and all of a sudden, I felt this presence on my back. I just knew that there was someone standing behind me. I thought it might've been my grandma from my mom's side because we had an ornament with her face on it on the tree, but I listened to/felt the presence (I don't know what to call it), and I knew that it was my grandma from my dad's side. I don't know how I knew it with such certainty, but I knew without any doubt that it was her. I guess maybe the thought was put into my brain. Her presence was so strong that I thought that if I turned around, I would see her face. I turned around, but I didn't see her face. She stayed there, though. She wasn't freaked out by me turning around. I just stayed there for a while, enjoying her presence. In hindsight, I wish that I had talked to her. Even if she wouldn't have answered me, it would've been neat to let her know that I wasn't freaked out by her. I think she knew that, though. If I was freaked out by her, I think she would've left. 

Eventually, I wanted to know what time it was, mostly because of the stereotype that ghosts show up at 3am. I knew that if I got up and checked the time, my grandma was going to leave, but I couldn't resist the urge. So I got up to grab my phone, which was charging on the counter, and it was 1:28 on Christmas morning. Sure enough, when I got back to the couch, she was gone. I wish I hadn't gotten up. Maybe if I would've stayed there all night, my dad would've gotten to see/feel her. When my dad was 14, she died of breast cancer. She came to him in visitation dreams 3 times, and it helped him accept her death. I know that's not really related, but I think it's interesting that she had come down to earth before, sort of.

 I actually have a theory of why my grandma came to visit me that Christmas, out of all the other Christmases I've been alive. So that whole year, my aunt was sick with cancer and a whole lot of other stuff. In October of 2018, she died. So maybe my grandma knew that my aunt was going to die, and she came to warn me. I know that I'll probably never know for sure, but I think that's a pretty good theory. My aunt was also the first child of hers to die, so maybe that also played a part in it? I don't know.

 Anyway, that's my story. This might be my only story. I don't have ghost experiences. Every once in a while I have this strong feeling that I'm being watched in my room, but that's not really concrete enough because I'm never sure if it's a ghost or not. I'm really bad at ending things, so bye, I guess?"
"Update On My Hauntings","New Jersey","Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis","I've now experienced sleep paralysis more...

I have also communicated with one of the spirits I saw during one of those states. He is the large, black mannequin. He is pitch black, with only white eyes showing. He's tall. Tall enough to reach the doorframe of my closet, where he usually stays. He has always been around, but now he deliberately stays in my sight. 

I have not heard from the ""little boy"" in a long time. The other creatures I've seen in my paralysis still seem so vivid in my head. The white figure with the Galaxy like face, and the old hag. Both of whom frightened and harmed me. My girlfriend has seen me experience this, and it's scared her. I'm posting again tonight, as I've gotten a new major dream. I didn't see what was holding me down but the weight on my wrists allowed no movement. It was a strange state between reality, the setting wasn't my home... But I was in my bed and I could feel and see my cat next to me, hear her meowing and feel her brushing against me. She was there when I woke up, and looked shaken up. I heard whispering. It was all around me in this dream it was loud and threatening. ""Get out of this house."" ""Get out of this house."" Over and over layered over incoherent whispering. I don't live in a house, nor seen anything close to the one in my dream. An old Victorian styled manor. Am I maybe picking up spirits in other locations? I was able to get up, only after frantically looking around and catching a glimpse of my mannequin friend, Manson. He stood and I think he helped me. He never harms, and I'm not scared of him. 

I ran out of my room. My mother believes me, but my father is still sceptical. They've been experiencing things as well as activity has increased. Footsteps in rooms that are empty, bangs and shaking cabinets. Things still move or go missing... And now the bathroom tub turns on by itself. It's happened many times and my mother and girlfriend have heard/seen it. One example was, my girlfriend and I were cooking and my mom was at the table... We heard water running and the tub faucet was turned on. No one was in the bathroom or near it. Its strange. My dad has heard footsteps in the kitchen, and even seen shadows. Yet he refuses to fully believe. 

My brothers still talk to things too, I worry if my ""little boy"" has moved in to them? I still know nothing about it, or if it really is a child spirit. 

My friend who knows a bit about spirits says Manson might be a demon, but not one who means harm. He's an observer. 

Manson has always been here, since I was a child. He has comforted me when I've been scared. He's there when I experience these SP states and nightmares. He feels comforting, like I know him, but I don't. I worry still, what if this ""child"" is connected to him, or what if it isn't. I don't know what's scarier to think about. 

Any advice? Should I seek help? Who would I even go to?"
"Demonic Entity Outside My Window","Washington","Non Human Entities","In 2004 on October 31st I witnessed a very disturbing image that still haunts me even today now that I am 25 years old. I was 9 years of age at the time and on that day I spent the entire time at home with the whole family watching movies and eating chocolate candy. We never really celebrated Halloween not because of our beliefs nor the fact that Halloween was such a scary holiday but rather the fact that my parents never understood the reason why people would waste money on costumes or risking us children getting into an accident. Well throughout the day we decided to watch a few films that we had rented in order to spend the night with the family.

As a young child I have always had a passion with drawing so I always carried a sketchbook with me everywhere I went. That night as we watched movies I began to doze off and had the desire to draw rather than watch the movie. Lucky for me my sketchbook was on my bed in my room. As I walked towards my room I opened the door and walked in. While the lights were off and my bedroom window open I looked to my right to turn on the lights but as I faced my right I could not help notice the disturbing image outside my window. 

What I seen outside my window was the head of a pig but not any ordinary pig. The flesh seemed to be beaten so bad, the snout ripped apart, the left eye gouged out and the ears ripped off. The only detail that really stood out was it's red glowing eye, as I stood there for a few moments staring I could not move as if I was paralyzed. I wanted to walk out the room as quickly as possible but it's moments like these that fear wins over our actions. Years later I tried to search for more cases relating to the supernatural involving the bodiless pig. 

I never really found any sources relating to my experience until I heard the case of the Amityville haunting. Long story short the young boy who experienced the strange phenomenon at the Amityville house also witnessed the bodiless pig outside his window. What does this mean? After all my research and wanting to understand I finally came to an understanding that "" Things are better left alone than explained"". Till this day Paranormal activity has still been active in my home and myself including my family have become used to the phenomenon.

About a year ago I ran into the family who lived on our property before my parents purchased the house in 1996. As we talked about the experiences that I and my family have encountered over the years, the father of the family did not seem so surprised. As I explained the Headless Pig apparition he also talked about his experience about witnessing the same pig head outside his window. I understand I was only 9 years old when I witnessed the demonic entity outside my window which could of been all in my head or imagination but what is the coincidence that the family before us who lived on the same property witnessed the exact same image outside their window. 

What are your thoughts and opinion?"
"Demon?","Minnesota","Haunted Places","20 years ago I bought a house in St. Paul near Mounds Park. I went to bless my house with sage and my whole body started to jitter to the point I had to stop, everything was fine in the upper levels then the blessing in the basement was just nothing I have ever experienced. I'd have kept going, but my friend yelled stop as I was going pale. This was just the start.

 We renovated the basement and as I was laying tile in the corner of the basement the most disgusting stench came out of nowhere. My cat at the time crouched on his belly, smelled it and backward crawled to the stairs very slowly like he was afraid.

 Some months later my husband at the time began drinking heavily and began a very bad drug addiction.

 One evening we watched tv and he made a loud sound like he was in pain, he reached to his calf like it was burning and had three red deep scratches.

 My daughter heard terrible noises when she lived in our basement and we had a lice infestation and had to shave my grandsons head. We never got it. The three of us on the upper level were or so I thought were free and clear.

 Shortly after we had black mold and flooding in the basement. My husband was turning into a pile of crap, treating me and my son badly. He even went after my daughter's boyfriend with a baseball bat. I protected myself with the Holy Spirit, salted around the house and did the best I could.

 We divorced, there was a no knock raid on our house which was a total pitfall for the police and the total destruction of my marriage. I had a basic nervous breakdown just before this for no apparent reason. Anyway he went to prison, I stayed in the house until I could get enough for an apartment.

 One evening my mother stayed with me and a damn bat flew out of the cat door we had installed on the basement door right up her frighten nightgown. That was my last laugh in that house.

 Come to find out the plat of land/ property showed all that purchased this crap pile had died, divorced and went bankrupt. I went bankrupt and divorced also. I used to be optimistic and happy, I divorced my husband when he was in prison. I did find someone new, but I feel like something has attached to me. I am a depressive, have fibromyalgia, my back goes out almost monthly, I hear projected voices, most resent a boy calling for mom, previously my name in my dead brother's voice, and am an alcoholic now, I never ever expected that. I have seen things since all of this too, neighbors swing, just one swing when there is no wind, but was compelled to watch even though I would have poo pooed it away. I have a sense or extra sense, but am concerned that not all of these bad experiences are anything to do with my natural sensitivity. Of course there is much more to this story, but I'd be here for days. If anyone can give me any advice I will definitely appreciate it."
"The Events That Started It All","Washington","A Haunted Life","Keep in mind this is just the story that started most of the paranormal experiences that My friend and I have experienced. This is far from all of what has happened, but this is where it gets scary for us.

So, this story starts back in 2015. Before then I have had a few paranormal experiences, some shadows/voices, but nothing that really shook me up. However there was one night I was driving with my friend that everything changed. Keep in mind, we were about 17/18 at the time and are avid believers in the paranormal, but were fairly realistic with what caused certain events.

This was about 10 at night, and we live in a small town near Spokane, WA. All there was to do to get out of the house in all reality was drive around. We used to go to cemeteries frequently, and would often go to the local small town one. The town has 2, there is an old one dating back to the 1700's and is filled with unmarked graves and an unmarked mass grave. The newer one claims to not have any unidentified graves, but everyone knows that is false. 

Again, we were driving around at 10 at night, we were desperate to get out of the house and had a full tank of gas and a 4 wheel drive vehicle. During the entire drive, everything was like normal, nothing out of the ordinary had happened. But, when we were passing the cemetery, we had heard a blood curdling scream, almost like someone was getting murdered. Keep in mind that there was no one out there and no animals. There is no one we could have even remotely even hit. There was even a moment where we had lost complete control of our vehicle. Thankfully we weren't going very fast and only lasted a moment.

 We kept driving (we sure as hell weren't going to stop) and after that we noticed a thick fog had developed and seemed to follow us around. At this time it was about midnight and we had an overwhelming feeling of dread following us around. We had found that if we stayed in the part of town with people/cameras that the fog wouldn't follow all the way, but it still lingered nearby. We had a full tank of gas like mentioned earlier, so we literally stayed in the vehicle until the fog cleared up. At the stroke of 3 a.m. The fog literally dissolved, but at this point we were still too shaken up to go home. At 5 am we had finally calmed down just enough to go home. We lived 2 blocks from each other, so I dropped her off first, then while keeping each other on the phone I went home. At both houses we had parents/siblings and I had my boyfriend there, so thankfully we weren't alone. However we were still so anxious from what happened we couldn't go to sleep immediately. 

My brother and his friend practice Wicca, and happen to know more than they probably should about demons and what not. (I feel like they're playing with fire but that's on them) but we were talking to them about it. And they think we heard a death echo and there may had been bad spirits or entities following us.

Now is the scariest/creepiest part of the whole ordeal. I was driving home from school. My Friend worked part time for the town and her job was maintenance for the cemetery such as mowing/weeding/flowers/watering and just overall care. I wanted to stop by and say hi for a few since it was on my way home. I was driving by and saw her, however I got this overwhelming feeling of dread and just overall felt like I needed to get out of there. Now. So I kept driving, but I still wanted to say hi so I called her. I said ""hey sorry I just passed you at the cemetery but thought we could meet in a few for lunch or something"". She asked me what I was talking about and I told her I had told her that I drove by the cemetery, but didn't tell her about the feeling I had. She said ""Boo, I haven't been there for a bit, at least 10 minutes. I'm home now and have been making lunch"". Now I'm confused because I legit saw her, so I immediately drove to her and saw her pickup and went up inside (didn't have that feeling) and there she was. In the same attire that I had just seen ""her"" wearing at the cemetery. She was obviously shook up, but she still had to work out there. 

This ended up happening a couple more times too when I would drive by. She even told me herself that she saw herself there, however when she did it appeared she was covered in blood. She was driving up to work that day, but immediately turned around. After that she refused to go back without a group of people. There was one instance where she was working and had an overwhelming sense of dread. She abandoned the mower and left. Shortly after I had drove by (again) and saw what looked like her. We again talked to my brother and his friend about this, and they didn't have too much insight. They had a few thoughts about what it was, but nothing definitive. 

We have had multiple experiences since then with not just those feelings we had, but with things we have seen. I don't purposely go out there anymore and in the 5 years since then I haven't seen that apparition anymore. However, we are looking for answers for some of what has happened or if anyone else had experienced anything like that. Currently we are 23/24 and there's only a few people we can talk to about this. So any insight, advice or knowledge would be greatly appreciated."
"Going To The Cemetery","Indiana","Family / Friends Visits","Today, Feb.8, 2020 at approximately 1:45pm my husband and I were heading to the Cemetery to visit my youngest sister who passed away at age 38. Today made two years and we were meeting my family to visit her. 

Weird things have been happening, like my husband's toothbrush being thrown twice in the shower. Weird I know, but today on our way the radio station kept changing on us as we were driving. We have a newer vehicle so no issues with it. It has never happened before.

 I've been really depressed the last few weeks knowing this terrible anniversary was coming up. I was anxious, afraid to go. It makes it too real to see her headstone. 

I wonder if it's her? I find dimes and pennies, see shadows, hubby's toothbrush gets thrown in the shower. I think about her daily. I miss her so much. So much was left unsaid when she passed. I'm not sure if this is real, meaning I'm kind of freaked out and so is my husband. I want to see her so bad. I want to talk to her. Sometimes I feel someone rubbing my side when I'm in bed, when I'm sad. I know it isn't my husband, he sleeps in a separate bedroom because of his cpap machine. 

Is she visiting me? Or could it be my own energy doing this? I wish I could communicate with her. I wish I knew who this is. If she's trying to get my attention, if it's her or another family member.

 I know this stuff seems small, but this is new to us. My husband's brother also passed recently. His was due to his wife's neglects, it could have been prevented. We tried getting guardianship of him but lost. He was 57. My sister passed from cancer. She was 38 with a 5 year old and an eight month old. 

Thanks so much for letting me tell my small story. 

What do you think?

"Childhood Entities","North Carolina","Haunted Places","I've had paranormal type experiences as far back as I can remember. As a baby until about 7 years old I lived in/right beside an old haunted house. The house was built sometime in the 1800s. Me, my mom, my dad and my brother lived in the house for a few of those 7 years and the remaining time we lived in a mobile home right directly beside it, within 100ft. There was something happening EVERY night, whether it was lights turning on/off, to hearing someone walking up/down the stairs of the house very loudly, to even seeing an apparition. Like I said it was always something. I wish I had a camera or recorder back then I would have got something on it I'm sure. 

Even people outside of the house would know it was haunted, we lived in the country, but our nearest neighbors would go by and later ask my mom or dad ""You got the electric fixed in the old house?"" And they'd say ""No, Why?"" And the neighbors would be like ""Well when we rode past, it looked like there was lights on upstairs."" The crazy part, there was nothing but the old wires hanging down, no place to even put a light bulb. 

There is two occasions that really shook me. The first one was one day, me and a female cousin of mine were playing and we ran away from her brother into the old house. When we got in there, there's this board we had you could put across the door as a way to lock it, so that's what we did. Once we did that we look up at the stairs and there is this man wearing a red shirt with blue pants and you could see right through him. Me and my cousin looked at each other, like, are you seeing what I'm seeing? Once we got a grip, we screamed as we tried to remove the board from across the door and once that door opened, we flew passed her brother and he was like wtf? So we told him and even though he had seen things around there as well, he shrugged it off as if we were crazy. 

The second time I was scared out of my mind, it was only me, my mom and the same female cousin home in the mobile home bedside the old house and my mom was cooking in the kitchen, me and my cousin were in my brother's room watching Baywatch (lol). My cousin gets up to go to the kitchen for something to drink, so I was alone in the room and creeped out - I always felt like I was being watched so I decided to go in there with them. I go to walk out the bedroom door and feel the urge to stop and look to my left, and omg I felt frozen from fear at what I saw 😱. It was only a head/face peeping out of the bathroom door with piercing black eyes staring at me, what I felt like into my soul. It almost appeared to be an old native American man, maybe woman. It didn't speak, just stared. I was so scared and on edge by things paranormal and non paranormal going on, I'm not sure if it was a good or bad presence. 

However I do feel as though it follows me wherever I go, I say that not only because I feel it but one time I was at the same female cousin I was with the night I seen it years later and was taking pictures and when I had the film developed there was a picture someone took of me, and I don't like having pictures taken of me, so I had my hand in front of my face and in between my fingers it looked like the same face I had seen years earlier, only it was a bluish color instead. 

After I seen that face that day it was a long time before I saw another apparition full on, I'd see figures of a solid black man out of the corner of my eye, to turn and nothing be there. So, anyone can believe what they want, but for me, I KNOW there is more out there than just this ""physical"" world, as well, there is so much we weren't taught or were taught wrong, even if the ones that taught us had the best intentions. Anywho that's all for now folks! 😛"
"Whispers I Can't Explain","California","Haunted Places","There may be a logical explanation for this... Like my laptop simply picking up on some other electronic device's frequency somewhere... But right now I am stumped. 

 Two nights ago I was on the laptop, wasting time watching a youtube video, and it ended, and I paused the screen so as to stop another one playing automatically, the way it does. And all of a sudden I heard whispering, that I assumed was coming out of my laptop. At first, I thought nothing of it, because I thought, 'Oh, maybe an ad or something is playing on another website that I didn't close.' But there was nothing playing. I closed all the computer windows, and the whispering (very soft woman's voice just whispering, too softly to make out specific words, but I got the impression it was in English, and I didn't detect any accent in particular. It continued for about a minute or two, I think, and turned into steady deep breathing as if they'd fallen asleep. It was so noticeable that I looked around to see if one of the cats was sleeping nearby (though that still wouldn't explain the whispering!) but they were off in the back bedroom, nowhere near. There is no working radio or TV in the garage where my laptop is, and no neighbors were playing a radio outside or anything like that. The whispering started up again maybe an hour later, and I tried to focus this time on where it was coming from. It seemed to be coming about eight inches to the left of the laptop, not out of the laptop itself after all, but from the desk itself, though it was still difficult to tell exactly. Happened one more time maybe a half hour later, and nothing since then. I think I wouldn't have been freaked out if it was obviously a radio program coming through, but one person continually whispering, and then seemingly sleeping, and then whispering again in the middle of the night got me a bit rattled. 

Thanks for reading this, and I appreciate any possible insight anyone can give me, or maybe someone has had a similar experience."
"The Night I Saw The Shadow Man","Pennsylvania","Haunted Places","When I was just a little kid, my older sister and I would always stay over at my grandparents house. At that time, I was only 5 and she was 7. I had another sister but she was too young to sleepover. Anyway, whenever we slept over, we had to share a room and the bed. The room that we stayed in was on the second floor next to a bathroom and my grandparents bedroom. To a normal person the room would seem off. There wasn't anything wrong with it.

The first time my sister and I slept over, like I said, I was 5. Some say that I was too young and don't remember it too well or that I just made up what happened. I thought that too until my mom gave birth to another daughter. Then 7 years later, she starts to sleepover at my grandparents house. But not in the same room. Since, I would always end up waking everyone in the house up by screaming. My grandmother blocked the room off from the rest of her house after I told her about the shadow behind the light. 

Now, you might be wondering, ""What happened?"" or ""What shadow?"" Here's the story.

My older sister and I were getting ready for bed the first night over at our grandparents house. We were so excited but also nervous because it was our first sleepover. Anyway, time past by quickly and we were all tucked in bed. Our grandfather went to bed early while our grandmother stayed awake. On the other hand, we couldn't fall asleep. After staying up and talking for a few minutes, my sister grew tired even though she was wide wake. Another minute passed and she was asleep. And just like that, I was alone. 

I rolled over to get more room on the bed but I ended up frozen. I saw the lamp. It was a tall lamp in the room and light shined in on it from a window. But that wasn't what made me freeze. There was a figure. Or as I like to call it, Shadow Man. The Shadow Man wore a top hat and that's all I could make out of the figure. I stared at it for what seemed like an eternity and yet it didn't move. So me being a kid, I thought that it was just a shadow from the window shining inside the room. But I was wrong.

Right as I was about to turn back over to face my sister, it moved. The Shadow Man was moving towards me. So I did the only a 5 year old could do in a time like that. I screamed. And it went away. I don't know where it went but it was gone. Of course my whole family woke up and came into the room. And then I realized it wasn't just 9:30 pm, it was 4:00am. Right on the dot. 

This went on every time I slept over, but then I got older and stopped. That's when my grandmother shut down the room. Now I am 16 and I still see the Shadow Man in my nightmares. So I do ponder if it was real or not. But one thing is still off about it all. Because every once and awhile, everyone in my house will bolt up at 4:00am and we all don't know why. 

What I do know is that whatever that Shadow Man is, it isn't good."
"Black Mass And Mimic","Pennsylvania","Haunted Places","Not so long ago, I lived with my boyfriend, B. The house was built in the early 80's and to my knowledge, had none of the typical events that would cause paranormal activities. I have recently moved from the home in which these events took place and am no longer experiencing this. It was however, very unnerving when it happened over a period of four to five years.

There was a corner of the basement that always creeped me out. I saw a black mass there on several occasions. It was not transparent but appeared solid and seemed to suck the light from the surrounding area. It did not expand or contract in size. Sort of like a black storm cloud somehow captured in a finite space. I also saw this thing move past the upstairs doorways - always in doorways, right?

I got the distinct feeling it was connected to the voices. Not just any voices, but OUR voices...

The first time this happened, I was alone except for Luke, my dog. I was painting in the bedroom at the end of the hall. I heard the door open and close and thought ""awesome, B is home early"". While I put down my paint brush, Luke went toward the front door, as he usually does when B comes home. So, I'm walking down the hall and hear B say ""hi"", just as he does. But, when I get to the room, no one is there. Just Luke, wagging his tail and looking excited like he does when B comes home...WEIRD. It was several hours before B came home, at the normal time.

Over the next few years, I hear B's voice on many more occasions when he is not there. It sounded exactly like him and said things he would say. Usually just single words, ""hi"" or ""hey"" or even my name. B has a very deep, smooth and distinctive voice and this thing copied it perfectly.

Finally, I tell B I've heard ""talking"" in the house, WITHOUT mentioning it has his voice. And he says he's heard it too several times and - get this - it sounds just like me! So now I know he won't think I'm crazy and share the whole story with him. I find that his experiences are very similar to mine.

HOW CREEPY -What sort of thing does this and why?

Maybe this thing was trying to put us at ease (big fail), but to what end?"
"Wraith Demon Stalker","Missouri","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","Last year around April or May I had walked to a local gas station in my town of St Joseph, Missouri on a street not too far from my small street. I was walking one Sunday night forgetting that the gas station was closed at 10:00 PM. The thing is that I had smelled the foul odor of fire and smoke and I decided to keep an eye out for any building, or house fires and as soon as I walked up to the gas station the smell had stopped but that is not all I have experienced that night. The only gas station that was open was the one a little bit further up east from the gas station I intended on going to, and I had said, ""I'm not going to walk there."" As I walked home the smell kept getting stronger and then right around the corner of my street is when I turned around and had seen a wraith like thing in all black with no face and no footstep sounds. 

 The next day I was talking to my neighbors and felt the negative spirit again, I had thought that I would have seen it again, but since that night it hasn't happened again and there hasn't been an odor of smoke and fire. Another thing that's creepy is that there is an old cemetery not far from my place off of a street. The ghosts there watch over me to make sure that the wraith and Belial is keeping from attacking me. 

 I do believe that the wraith I had encountered with was Belial has been there since my birth. Any suggestions on how to remove any evil spirits from my life? Is there a house blessing ritual that doesn't require any smoke and chants? What will cost me the best paranormal investigators to ensure and tell me that it will no longer be a threat?"
"Evps In My Apartment","Oklahoma","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I've always had a connection to the other side since I was a child. Can see, hear, feel Spirits. I lost a great deal of family and friends since I was 19 including my mom. I knew about evp, but never officially tried it. Well about a year ago I tried it. I get all these voices. Men, women, really don't know who they are. Some are soft and hard to hear and others are loud! But they won't tell me who they are really. I don't feel scared tho. I've heard one name and it said Zak which is an ex of mine of committed suicide few years back. Just not sure if I should keep doing this or stop. I don't want to open the door for anything else. I've blessed or cleansed my apartment with sage and palo santo wood as well as myself.

 This morning when I touched my alarm clock I was recording and very loud they said hurry up now and you hear laughing. Just blows my mind! Just curious if anyone else out there has ever experienced this and what did you do? Other voices in past said like ok in response to questions I was asking. When I would describe the image I saw in my minds eye about what they looked like, the man said that's right! So they are intelligent responses. Now as far as physical activity I just hear few noises here and there. Lights go on and off on occasion, but it's an old apartment building. And others could make noises so it's hard to debunk that. But the voices I can't. Because I don't hear them when recording obviously! Anyways would love the feedback on this matter! Thanks so much."
"Those Eyes Sent Fear Coursing Through My Veins","Wisconsin","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","This is my first story on this website, so sorry if it's bad. Also, I don't remember everything from that night. I only vividly remember the important things from that night. This happened when I was 5 or 6, and I am 14 now. This is about my brother and I. This is a true story by the way. I also apologize for any spelling and grammar errors.

 It was a normal night. Me, being the scaredy cat I was at the time, waited in my bedroom with the door closed. My house always gave me the creeps, especially the hall, so I usually kept my door shut. I was waiting for my brother to come and tell me mom and dad were asleep so he could sneak me into his room like always. Eventually he came and off to his room we went. I slept on the floor between his bed and the door. I usually wanted the door closed, but it was summer and his room was small and warm, so we left the door open a crack. We talked for awhile then he decided he wanted to sleep. I don't remember if I fell asleep and then woke up or if I was awake the whole time, but when I rolled over to face out the door and into the hallway I saw these eyes. Eyes I've never even dreamed of. They were green and glowing. Those horrid eyes felt evil and I felt the fear coursing through my veins as I stared straight at them. It was like a staring contest. I was too paralyzed with fear, I couldn't look away. If I remember correctly the eyes were standing right in front of my bedroom door. I don't remember if I ever looked away or not, but I remember waking up my brother. He wouldn't get up and look out the door. He said he was tired and I should go to sleep. I don't remember if the door ever got closed, but I do remember hiding under my teddy bear blanket with my eyes shut tight. I just hid under the blanket in fear of seeing those glowing green eyes. That's how I fell asleep too: Under the blanket with my eyes tightly shut.

 It's been years now and I haven't seen those terrifying eyes again, but as much as I want to forget about them, I can't. I remember the fear they gave me. I was so scared and I wasn't just scared for me. I was also scared for my brother. I do believe those eyes were evil. I believe they wanted to scare or hurt us, but they didn't and I am grateful for that.

 Thank you for reading my story. I have more, but I'm not sure if people want to hear my encounters. Farewell."
"It Comes At Night","California","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","For as long as I can remember, I have been bothered by something at night time. Nothing sexual, just my bed moving, my sheets pulled off, my hair being touched, breathing and hearing whispering next to me. I even got hit with a water bottle cap once as I was trying to sleep. It stops for a while and then when I least expect it, it will start again. It really doesn't scare me that much anymore, more than anything I feel annoyed by it. I'm not sure if it is always the same ""thing"" or not, it's been going on for a very long time. I also don't know if it friendly or not. I say this because a couple of times I've been woken by something just in time to avoid danger. I can't remember if I have submitted a story on that here yet, I'll check and if I haven't I will submit one. 

Anyway, this happened to me just a few weeks ago. I keep thinking about it and trying to relive those few seconds. 

I'm pretty sure I was dreaming, I'm not sure if I saw myself in bed but I remember seeing a black shadow standing at the foot of my bed, it looked like it was getting closer as if it was ready to get in the bed or was leaning in. I remember thinking ""I got you, I finally see you!"" I was really angry and started kicking out trying to hurt the shadow. Next thing I know I'm awake and kicking my feet, I had my eyes open and for a few seconds I was able to see the shadow and another more solid looking form standing next to the shadow. I remember hearing a sigh, not made by me, the kind you make when you are surprised. Then I saw both forms go down really fast, like they ducked or like a vacuum sucked them in. Sorry, I'm not good at describing or explaining things. The thing that surprises me the most is that as I was kicking I felt I was hitting something solid but what I was seeing was a shadow. Even if I was hitting the other more solid looking form, it shouldn't feel solid. I thought ghosts or spirits or whatever were supposed to feel like air. One other thing that I should mention is that my feet were uncovered so I was not hitting a blanket. I stayed awake for the remainder of the night and I remember my feet having that sensation like when you just kick something solid. 

What I find funny now is that instead of being scared all I was thinking then was ""I knew it, I knew there was something here, I'm not crazy!"""
"The Highway","Connecticut","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","My family has a history of weird happenings. My grandmother on my father's side is a firm believer in the Paranormal and has tried to impress the same belief on me. My mother on the other hand, has always been a sceptic and disapproves of my grandmother's tall tales. I tend to side with my mom and write most things off as strange but explainable. Most of the goings-on have been confined to our home but this is the first experience of something in the wild and is I believe, my first actual sighting. 

It was November last year, coming up on midnight. It was a cool night and road conditions were clear. Mom and I were driving back into town over a stretch of road called the 'Brae'. It's the secondary road into town and pretty desolate. There's a few farms but quite a lot of them are abandoned. 

We were on a straight part of the road. I was on my phone while talking to mom. As I look up I see a figure of a girl suddenly appear. It's hard to put into words. It's not like the girl was lit up as the car moved forward or walked out from the edge of the road, she just appeared in the middle of the road.

Mom braked but it was no good, there was no way we were stopping in time. The car skidded. I clenched my teeth and waited for the impact of the body hitting our car but nothing came. Our car ended up sideways on, basically blocking half the road.

I turned to mom and saw she was slumped in her seat. Panicking, I realised she had somehow been knocked out. I didn't understand how, we didn't hit anything and the car had only braked. I shook her arm but she didn't respond. I kept prodding at her until I got a groan in return. As she came to, I turned to look and could see the figure behind us, completely fine. As I watched her, she disappeared as she had arrived."
"Pacheco Pass' Ghost In Black Robes","California","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","Years ago driving back from Sacramento to Monterey I went over Pacheco Pass, and I saw a small car broken down on the side as I was coming down the hill. There were kids in the back seat playing under a sheet, and there was a lady on the passenger side with the door open.

 I felt bad for not stopping and was giving myself a hard time telling myself if I saw anyone else (fat chance) that I would have to stop when suddenly I saw a priest walking down the right side of the road. He was wearing a black robe, and it reminded me of that character from SNL back in the 80s, Father Guido Sarducci. I figured since it was a priest there was no question that I had to pull over and help.

 When I pulled up he looked old with his face all wrinkly and burnt like I remember the old homeless guys living under Monterey Wharf looked, his clothes (robe) looked tattered like he had gone through some serious roughness, and he looked very mad. When I asked him if he needed help he mumbled something, but I couldn't understand. I told him they might hassle him for walking along the road, and then he turned to look right at me and spoke clearly: ""So you're trying to help me?""

 I told him I had thought he might need a ride, and he asked me if I had seen a woman walking, but I told him no. I thought this was strange since it was an odd place to take a walk, but I wished him luck and started again onto the road. I looked back in the rear-view and didn't see him, though. I remember thinking that was a little strange because there was nowhere out there to hide, but I just kind of ignored it until years later when a friend posted an article about ghosts in Central California and it described the ghost in black robe up on Pacheco Pass and it hit me.

 After a bunch of research, I found a forum where people were talking about experiences they had, and several of them described a small car on the side of the road with boys playing in the back seat under a sheet and a lady getting something out of the passenger side."
"Demons Attacking My Family","Maine","A Haunted Life","I am seeking help if there is any. My story is pretty long and messed up. It's probably all my fault. Thanks in advance.

I have always been interested in everything beyond the veil, I got my first set of tarot cards at 13 and have always seen ""dark shadows"" and UFOs. When Ancient Aliens came out I was obviously intrigued and soaked up any bit of information I could on the subject, including learning about women who ""mated"" with 4d light beings. I learned that I needed to become a medium to talk to these ""aliens"" and that's what I did.

 The house we lived in at the time was over 120 years old, sometimes we would hear a deep growling sound coming from the walls, one night my husband and I heard it yell at our newborn baby to ""shut up!"". Sometimes we would hear it walking around the house, one night it threw a heavy cast iron pan across the kitchen. We decided to move when we found a burned bandana sitting in the middle of the basement. It was clearly meant as a threat.

After the move I got more heavily into the new age spirituality. I obtained what I thought was a ""spirit guide"" who appeared to me every night as a purple mist. It was clearly a man, he spoke to me, gave me images of flowers and feelings of love and sexual energy. At one point this spirit told me I needed to write him a love letter dedicating myself to him and to sign it in blood, he gave me a symbol to write on it, which I have since learned is a symbol for Satan. My husband saw him too sometimes but he always gave my husband anger and hate, showing his face and telling him I was cheating on him (I have NEVER even considered it) my psychic powers were very good, I did readings on a regular basis and was told I was spot on every time. Sometimes as I meditated he showed me symbols to draw and taught me how to do reiki before I even knew what it was. He told me it was ""Psychic energy healing"" and with his help I practiced on my husband.

One night my husband was working late and I was laying in bed meditating with this spirit guide and it raped me. I became paralyzed and it fondled my body, it felt like static electricity running down my neck, around my breasts and bottom and I felt it play with my lady parts, and it finished with quick penetration. I became very alarmed at that point and somehow broke through the paralysis screaming ""No!"" This was not the first time it had physically touched me, but it was the first and only sexual assault. All the while, my husband and I are having dreams of being sexually assaulted by random people (I never had sexual dreams before this, now it happens once a month, I will explain later) I will add my husband and I were having significant marital problems because of the anxiety and anger this thing made my husband feel (we didn't realize it was psychic attacks) 

After this I was afraid. I trapped the spirit in a salt trap using a candle and called a local medium to help me get rid of it. The medium came to my house and told me I had a ""spirit husband"" who was very beneficial to me but that the spirit hated my husband and would do anything it could to tear us apart. They opened a door and had me tell it to leave. It stayed away for about a month then came back. I think it came back because I was still practicing mediumship and energy healing.

2 months later I had a miscarriage that turned my whole world upside down. After the miscarriage the activity increased. My husband and I would randomly hear a baby crying, we would run to our sons room thinking it was him, but he was sound asleep. I had visions of a baby and once had a dream of myself, laying naked on a cold metal table with an alien baby. Sometimes I would feel the weight of a child in our bed as I listened to the cry. I developed significant depression and my husband sought therapy for his anxiety. 

We eventually bought a house and moved away but everything followed us, we would hear little feet running upstairs but our son was asleep, at one point my husband saw an apparition of a toddler in our son's room. My 4 year old son doesn't sleep through the night, he says ""the ghosts are bothering me"" (I tell him ghosts aren't real) he told me once the ghost told him "" this is my bed, get your hands off of my toys!"" We also continued to seeing the purple mist. I saged my house and bought each of us onyx stones to protect us, I tried to psychically close all of the portals in our home and bodies to no avail. Obviously only God was powerful enough to protect us.

 I turned to the Bible because now things were affecting my son, I learned what I was doing was against God's word and I threw out everything occult related and never practiced mediumship again. We pray as a family multiple times a day and have repented. My relationship with my husband has greatly improved and we have fully dedicated ourselves to Christ. 

But the purple mist and the shadow toddler are still here. I need to mention too, my husband and I have been trying to have another baby for 2 years but have come down with ""unexplained infertility"", all of our levels are normal and we continue to have rape dreams always on the day I ovulate. We still experience psychic attacks.

A few days ago my husband saw the purple mist while falling asleep; it attacked him and punched him in the face. He then fell asleep and had a dream where he was attacked and the person told him ""what will you do once I take everything from you?"" He fought and won, but still, we can't get rid of these things. They're attacking my family, not allowing us to fall pregnant, and I fear for my son. I wonder if we somehow conceived one of those weird spirit babies and have been marked for our involvement in occult (even though we were ignorant) 

Is there anything we can do?"
"Car Keys Missing","Georgia","Haunted Places","This story happen around summertime last year. It was getting dark outside because the sun was going down. I'm in my bedroom watching some Chinese History Palace drama on my IPad in bed as always. Then I get a call from my neighbor, Mrs. Linda. She was missing her car keys and she couldn't find it. So I had to pause the drama I was watching from my IPad and get up from my bed to go put some shoes on. Then I went out of my room walk all the way out to the living room through the kitchen to the back door and proceed to Mrs.Linda's house. 

I cross the street to her front yard and made my way to her front door. Her front door was always locked but I have the keys to her house. So I unlock her front door to let myself in and I use my usual greeting that I was here, so she would not be in defense to protect herself. 

I went from her living room, all the way to her bedroom to where she was at for her to explain to me about what happened to her car keys. And she told me her car door is unlock. So it would be easier for me to find her keys. 

So went back out from her bedroom, through her living room and out the front door. And I went in driveway to her car and went in the driver side of the door. And started to look for her keys. I searched her floor boards, the side of driver seat, the console, the passenger side, the backseat floor, etc. I could not find her keys anywhere in the car. So I double check everything and still could not find it. 

So I went out of her car and closed the door, and proceed to the front door and went back into her bedroom to tell her I could not find her keys. And I told her keys must be with her. At first she didn't think her keys were with her. I told her to check her purse and there it was. 

Her keys were with her and her purse. She told me her car be alerting her by making a beep sound when she accidentally leave her keys in her car. And I told her maybe it was her house ghost playing tricks on her. Or maybe it was her husband spirit that did it. 

Because I knew her husband when he was alive. He was a very stubborn old man that like to aggravate his wife sometimes by playing tricks on her and stuff."
"A Party That Never Ends","New York","Haunted Places","I'm back after such a long absence. Hello everyone on YGS! It's been years! Last time I published a story here I was a teenager and I never really came back to write other stories, even though I've had a few more experiences since then. 

 This story is more just a small little thing that happened. It's nothing big or dramatic, I just think it's an interesting thing to see on a seemingly average day. 

 I was in New York City and going on a haunted tour where you walk around and hear ghost stories from your tour guide. Being into all things supernatural, I was loving hearing all these reports of spooky activity in the older parts of the city. We heard about terrible murders and the restless spirits that wander around the site of it to this day, we even saw one of the oldest graveyards in the city- I actually didn't see anything here but took pictures and I'm fairly certain you can see some ghostly faces looking out at us through the gates.

 But it was on the famous Gay Street that I saw something. This street had been famous mainly in the 1920s because the mayor of the city (who was a big party animal) had a mistress who lived there and they would have parties there a lot. There have been reports of people seeing a man in a top hat strutting down the street with a cane, just as the actual mayor did in his life. How extra, I love it (haha)! 

 When I got to Gay Street, and heard all these things, I was quite excited. I love the 20s as a time period and I've heard a lot about this particular mayor so honestly, I was expecting to see him taking a casual stroll towards me. I didn't, of course. But I did see something else. When I turned to get another look at the house they had all used to party so often in, after looking around the street, I saw as clear as anything, an arm in the window. 

 It was bent at an angle like it was dancing, almost like that ""Walk Like an Egyptian"" dance with the very clear turned out wrist movement. It also looked like a shadow or a silhouette, which I thought was kind of strange but it was incredibly clear despite that. I just saw the arm moving a bit for what was probably just a couple of seconds and then when I went to tell someone else I'd seen it, I looked back and it was gone. 

 I never really get scared when I see things like this, it's more like an excited feeling most of the time so I was kind of hyped up about it all. I took lots of pictures of the house from the outside but I didn't see any arms or anything. I thought I might've seen an orb but I think it was just the way the light was reflecting. 

 However, a couple of months later I was showing my friend some pictures and telling her the story when she said she could see something. She zoomed in to the top floor window of the house and slightly faintly I could see what appeared to be a man's face looking out at where I would've been standing. He looked like some sort of captain and was wearing that sort of hat. We checked all the photos and he's actually on most of them, moving around a bit because of the angle, I suppose. It's so weird because I had looked at those pictures so many times and I hadn't seen anything at all. I guess sometimes you need a fresh set of eyes to find things when you're too immersed in looking for an arm.

 I sometimes wonder how many spirits there are in that house and why they chose to stay there. Honestly, if I could spend my afterlife having a big party night after night, I think I would too. Seems like a very ""of the day"" way of doing things. I didn't get a feeling that there was anything bad in the house, either. It just seems like a big party that never has to end."
"Were These Demonic Signs In My Life?","California","Misc","It all started when I was 11, me and my family were in the front yard no one was in the house. We were playing basketball and I suddenly stared at my sister's window and suddenly I saw a fist from inside the house behind my sister's window smash her window. Then suddenly everyone stopped playing basketball and went to take a look at the broken window. I was shocked and speechless. My dad said it was a bird but there was no bird. I knew what I saw, it was a pale hand that made a fist. I told my dad and he checked the house but no one was inside.

Then when I was 12 I saw shadow people late at night in the hallway go to my sister's room and I was a very scared so scared I couldn't walk to the hall way to access my room so instead I ran out the house during the night to go across the street to my friend's house.

Then years later when I was 19 I was sitting in my friend's car and heard what appeared to be a big dog run around the car. It was parked in a underground parking lot so I don't know how any dogs would be there.

Then when I was 21 I had a experience of putting my mp3 player in my locker at the gym. And when I came back it was gone. I drove home and opened up the bathroom door and there it was! It was on the sink. Did it teleport? What was this? And why? I still think about this incident until this day. Do demonic forces have the ability to misplace items?...

Does anyone think these experiences were demonic?.

Or knows exactly what this was?.

Were these Omens? What exactly were these events?."
"Early Morning Scare","Missouri","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I Goggled to see if anyone had a the same experience as I just had. Found this site of Hauntings. It was January 17th, early morning like 2 or 3am, and my tv was on but the volume was way down, just a picture with little sound. It's very cold outside so I'm bundled with blankets in bed. It's my day off, I was lying there and all of a sudden I heard a man clearing his throat. It scared me, I thought someone was in my townhome.

 I moved in Aug 2018, built in 2008, and the lady before me moved out of state. Anyway, My garage door is next to my living room, so thought someone somehow made it in my home. I got up, still scared to look around and saw nothing. It's just me. All doors and garage door down and locked.

 I know what I heard, I heard a man clearing his throat, it was loud, like he wanted me to hear. I work at a prison been there for a few years. Maybe I was followed home, they said the prison is haunted. If I was followed home how do I get him out? I do watch haunted stuff on tv, but nothing was on like that. Still scared.

 I lived in one of my late parents houses in Kansas City historic areas and my step grandfather passed in the house in 1979, I was a teenager. I heard the same thing, but his sound was unique and I knew it was him, was he watching over me or scaring me, but why? That incident was in the 90s. Never told anybody, probably think I was crazy. The house was built in 1908, has a history. Just remembered getting out of bed and telling not to scare me like that and it never happened again, but other things did."
"Clock Radio Ghost","Minnesota","Haunted Items","Over the years I have had many random ghostly occurrences, But what happened with my alarm clock has to be one of the strangest.

I have a digital alarm clock/radio A few years back I removed the back up battery because it had gone dead. Since then the clock has worked fine while plugged in.

Until a couple weeks ago. When all of sudden at 3:21 pm the clock alarm went off for 1 beep then it stopped, then it went off for about a half a minute until I got up to go shut it off. It stopped when I got about a foot away from it, then it went to the alarm set screen for about 20 second then back to clock. 

Normally the alarm going off wouldn't be strange except that this clock has 2 alarms neither were set and even if they were set the last times they were set for was 5 pm and 11 am, So there was no reason for it to go off at 3:21.

The other weirdness about it is the clock going to the alarm set screen you have to press and hold the alarm set button for about 10 seconds to get it to that screen and when the alarm is set and goes off it goes off for 1 hour before shutting off not only about 30 seconds.

So I went upstairs to tell my dad about it because we have had some ghostly experiences before in our house and in truth I was bit freaked out so I stayed up there for about 5 minutes

When I finally got the courage to go downstairs again I checked the clock and it was on the normal time screen. But as soon as I started watching the clock it went again to the alarm set screen again and then back to normal time. 

So I watched the clock for about 10 minutes nothing was happening. Finally I said ""if your still here make it go back to the alarm set screen"" and within 30 seconds it went back to the alarm set screen. I have asked a few times since then but since then it hasn't done anything unusual. 

At first I thought well maybe my clock is starting to go out but seeing as this has not ever happened before this and hasn't happened since then it seems like it could be a spirit and the time chosen of 3:21 is my mom's birth-date and she recently died in August. So I am hoping it is my mom's spirit coming and visiting me. My mom believed in spirits and we were talking about it one day long before she passed away. I told her if you ever can contact me from the other side use the electronics because knocking things over in a house this chaotic would go unnoticed. Looks like she might have remembered."
"Exploding Glass","Pennsylvania","Misc","In the seventies my parents decided to leave the rat race of the DC area and built a home in rural southern Pennsylvania. Generally, it was not a creepy place. But, over the years there, a few things happened that could not be explained, this is one such thing.

When I hit my teenage years, I started to think about my spirituality more than usual, as I assume a lot of people do at that age. My parents were not particularly religious but some older family members were. Since I was a child, I'd gone to church with them on occasion - both Catholic and Protestant services - but did not feel moved by them. I found some beliefs to be unbelievable and others just plain silly. I wanted to learn more about spiritual philosophies and so, began to read books on the subject. I thought this would help me to make an informed decision and enable me to give myself the appropriate label. Like I needed another label, right? 

So, my room was the only one in the basement. It was cool in summer, warm in winter (due to the wood stove being down there) and afforded me my privacy for the most part, I liked it. I spent a lot of time there reading my books over the course of a few months. Buddhism, Hinduism, ancient religions now long gone, books on the afterlife, near death experiences, even the Satanic Bible, I read them all. While reading the last one, things got weird.

I was always hearing strange noises outside my room, clicks and bumps in the night. I could hear my beaded curtain being brushed aside when the lights were out. One night, after reading, I had just put the book down and turned off the light. My head barely hit the pillow before there was a loud POP, followed by another, then a gushing sound. I turned on the light to find my fish tank draining through a large hole in the glass, fish flopping helplessly in the puddle. I quickly ran and got something to put them in and the shop vac to clean up the mess. I examined the tank. Three cracks all the way across the front. They intersected in a way that formed a sort of triangle, the triangle of glass was missing. The next day, I cleaned up the mess more thoroughly, along with the rest of the room. I never found the missing triangle of glass. 

That night, again, just after reading - another POP. I turn the light on and look around. Fish are good, in their temporary bowl but, as I scan the room I see pens and pencils on the floor. I kept them in a glass, one of those thick, heavy beer glasses. The base of the glass sat right where it had been, but the top three quarters of it was scattered on the table and floor below. I left the clean up for the next day and went to sleep.

While cleaning up the glass the next morning, in broad daylight, another POP. This time a small dainty brandy glass filled with tiny seashells. Again, the base of the glass in its place, the bottom half still holding shells. The top, literally exploded into tiny shards.

I could rationalize the tank, tanks failed sometimes. But all three of these incidents in less than two days? That day, I got rid of the book. It was not so interesting anyway so I did not feel like I was missing out. No more noises at night, no more exploding glass.

So what do you think - merely coincidental?

Has anyone else experienced something like this?"
"A Spirit That Perfectly Takes On The Image Of The Living?","South Carolina","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","Long long long story short: There is a spirit that is mimicking me exactly. It's face is perfectly mimicked. It has no wonky eye, no misplaced eyelash, no incorrect coloration. It looks exactly like me. 

I have never seen it. My grandmother, father, and cousin have seen it. Here's my grandma's story. 

 (Fast back story the house had one owner before us and they moved out due to paranormal activity. When we moved out in elementary school we began renting the house to families we never informed. They all moved out due to paranormal activity.

My grandmother had heard of these stories and needless to say, she did not believe. She believes solely in her lil Southern Baptist Bible thumping ways and nothing outside of that norm. Yet this day she pondered on the idea of there actually being an entity in the house and began to pray against it to show itself. She was standing in what was my room, painting and praying. As she explained she simply wanted to see ""it"" if ""it"" was real. Yet as she prayed a 'person' appeared in the frame of the door way. She explained it as me. She said from head to toe it looked like me. Same hair, same eyes, same face, it was wearing clothing that was similar to my own. She said it could have been my twin. Yet it's facial expressions were much more sinister. She said it looked directly though her and once it glanced her way she screamed, it disappeared, and she left instantly

Please help. What could mimic me exactly? There's more stories to tell, not enough space."
"Catlike Humanoid","Pennsylvania","Non Human Entities","I have always hoped that I might get a glimpse the others. Those beings from fable and fairy tales of my childhood. Call them fairies, pixies, fay, elves or whatever, they are around... And I was lucky enough to get a peek.

This incident happened about ten years ago and every word is truth as I recall it. It's not something easily forgotten.

I was living in my grandparents' home after they both had passed on. Having grown up there, I was infinitely familiar with the house, surrounding area and all the indigenous critters thereabout, but I had NEVER seen anything like this.

It was early morning, just before sunrise. Just enough light to see outside. The TV was on, catching morning news before going to work. Everything completely normal. I could hear the kids getting ready for school down the hall from my room. My boyfriend and I were chatting about something irrelevant - he was standing a few feet from the window, facing me. I turned to face him while we talked - a movement outside the window caught my attention. I stopped talking mid-sentence.

There was something outside that window, it had a face. I couldn't quite make it out in the dim light. I moved closer to the window, it was moving too. It was low, I bent over. At first, I thought I was seeing a reflection in the glass. As I focused, what I saw made me make a sound I had never heard come from my mouth before - something between a gasp and a muffled scream -Ohhh, Ohhhhh - and I felt weak in the knees.

It was close to the house, maybe a foot outside the window, leaving three or four feet between us. I could not make out the body well. His skin was bluish-grey, just like the early morning light surrounding him. So much so, that he seemed to sort of melt into it on the edges, but his face was clear and he was leaning in toward me curiously, for a better look. I say ""he"" because it was most definitely male. He had a round head, with a shank of dark, messy hair that reminded me of a character from an anime cartoon. His large, cat-like eyes took up most of his face, a small, not quite human nose and mouth. He appeared to be two and half to three feet tall, petite, beautiful in a weird way. I do not remember seeing any clothing but got the impression that he was not completely nude and something was strapped across his body - a bow, maybe?

I wish I had reacted differently, but I was shocked and confused by this, after all, until now it was a completely mundane weekday morning. I made that awful noise. He was startled. Those huge eyes blinked, just once, quickly and almost mechanically and he gave his head a quick shake before he disappeared. He appeared solid, real and he didn't fade away, he turned and darted. I think I startled him when I reacted, and he was gone. This all happened in the space of about ten to fifteen seconds and I have never seen him again but, for a moment, we looked directly at each other in shared curiosity.

I pointed to the window and backed away. I sat, almost fell, onto the small couch behind me. My boyfriend asked again and again what was wrong. It took several minutes before I could find the words to say what I had seen. I still can't put a name to it, him. Next time, I will be less surprised and maybe, just maybe we can get a better look at each other."
"This Is Real","Oregon","Haunted Places","I'm Speechless...?!

Right now, just a little before 3:00 am in the morning I woke up to an awful burning sensation? I put my hand on my left arm that is on the outside of the bed, it hurt and came away wet, like it was bleeding. I'm laying there in the dark jolted out of a dead sleep thinking,""what the heck!"" So I jump up and run into the bathroom and turn on the lights, the lower part of my arm isn't bleeding but it has a long burn on it, there is blistering now, a long red welt and the skin is raised and hurting from it, I don't know HOW anything like this can happen?!

My boyfriend came running in the bathroom staring at me and my arm in disbelief (he's never believed in the paranormal before) asking what's wrong? I put something for burns on it and it stopped hurting so much. He got out the camera and took a picture of it. It's began to blister now. Now he's so scared he won't go back in our bedroom, he's in the spare bedroom sleeping while I type this out. I usually don't talk much about my experiences but now I'm being attacked... Worse than the scratches a few years before. Now something is burning me. I need some advice, but I don't know where to turn, I'm afraid to go back to bed. I guess I'll just stay on the couch and turn on the TV until I can go back to sleep.

This happened to me in December of 2016. It blistered up and the popped open, it was awful and painful.😢 I have called so many paranormal phone numbers, but no one replies. There's a television show called ""The Dead Files"" and I did reach the producer on the phone once. They couldn't come out and do an investigation because we don't own the house, but now we do. I will look for that number again since things are more active around my place again. 

Nothing that serious has happened to me until this past November 2019. First I heard tiny bells ringing in my bedroom as I laid in bed to go to sleep. I have some little tiny bells on a strip of cloth laying over my mirror. It was attached to a blouse, and I cut them off to save them since the blouse didn't fit me any more. I discovered that was the sound I heard the next morning. Then a few more nights later as soon as my head hit the pillow for sleep, a bell started jingling right beside me!? I was so scared I jumped up and turned on the light, nothing there. Later the next day, I found a walking stick I had added a little bell to. I had forgotten all about it. It was right across from my bed, I've moved it since then because it freaked me out.

Then this past November the 7th I was laying in my recliner and not moving at all. I was watching TV when something jabbed me in the lower part of my left leg. I yelled out in pain and began rubbing it with my other leg. I didn't know what to think and just laid there in the chair. I had the leg that got stabbed hanging over the side of the chair for a while. I got up for something. When I came walking back to my chair I saw three big drops of blood on the carpet! I began cleaning it up. I didn't know what to think as I stood up from cleaning the blood up. I had a long night gown on and raised it to see that my leg had been bleeding and the blood was on both legs, and all over my nightgown?! I'm once again speechless and don't know why these kinds of things are happening to me. I feel helpless and very alone trying to talk about it with people.

P.S. I submitted this story about a week ago but never got notification that it was received, so I'm submitting it again.

 I'm also happy to say I got a phone call from a paranormal group that will be calling me back in a week!"
"Second Time, Second House","New York","A Haunted Life","On my birthday of 2019, September 5th, my girlfriend and I were leaving early for Colorado. We went to bed about 9:30 and about 20 minutes after shutting off the TV and light, neither of us even close to sleep yet, all of a sudden there was a loud crack on the footboard of our bed. 

About 3 years earlier, I had lived in an apartment where similar things had happened so I knew as soon as it happened just what it was, a ghost or something not of our everyday world. I turned a light on, looked under bed, nothing there or out of place. She turned on a vapor lamp, which she had sage oil in. Very dim light, but, nonetheless, it was light. 

We laid back down and I kept feeling something touching my face, like a string dangling with just the tip touching my face. This happened several times. First my temple, I'd wipe my hand across it. Next, above my eye. Three or four times. Then I noticed she kept doing the same thing with her hand. I asked, ""Are you feeling something touching your face?"" She answered, ""Yes, a hair keeps tickling me."" I told her it wasn't a hair. I was feeling the same.

Again, we tried to fall back asleep. A couple seconds later, I heard, very clearly, a human breath in my ear, in and out, or, vise versa. I had enough time to think, did I just hear that? And it did it again, exactly! In and out, or vise versa. 

About 6 months before this, I had just gotten up. My mom lived with me at the time and made my coffee. As I walked back toward kitchen table, I saw a cat, about same color and size of my dog, run under table. Clearly a cat. On the other side of table, where my mom sat having coffee, only a streak or blur. I looked under the table, even though I knew my dog was still in bed with my girlfriend. No dog! I went to the bedroom to check and Rupert, my dog, was in bed with her. Mom and I had seen shadows out of the corner of our eyes a few times before but that's all in that house. 

About three years prior, my mom and I had lived in an apartment in the Mohawk valley. About three months in, I woke to a loud crash at either 2am or 2:30am (I forget now), I found two large Rubbermaid bins, which were very heavy, had been pushed end ways into my spice rack and stuff was everywhere. 

From thereon, for a couple months, things got worse. Palm slaps on couch at 6 at night, messing with our cell phones, etc. We moved to get away, that's how bad it got. 

Before we moved, I seen a flash of light near a glass based lamp in living room. The glass was very thin and the sound I heard was as if electricity had touched that thin glass at the same time I saw the flash. It was round and almost as big as a volleyball. 

My dog saw things also. His head would go straight up to the ceiling and across to the front door and he'd bark at top of door. Many things happened in that place. We all heard it but I was the only one to see anything. Just as I was the only one to hear breathing in my ear. 

As I walked out that same door my dog barked at, I could literally feel the negative energy leave me. 

Something to know, our phones would be messed with while miles away from the house. I've had the worst bad luck for the last two years, breakdowns at work like never before. And not only at work. Any ideas? I'd love to hear feedback."
"My Three Hauntings","California","A Haunted Life","There were three hauntings I have had in my life that stand out and to me are worth telling. 

The first was when I was child living in Van Nuys, California on Sherman Way. The house we lived in was an old house that was on 3.5 acres right in the middle of Van Nuys, with an apartment building on one side and a welding shop on the other. But it was still like living in the country for us. 

There was an small orchard, grapevines, trees all over and out buildings leftover from when it was, I guess, a farm. We had chickens, dogs, cats, horses, and a few goats. My parents were into show-type business and my father had built a small western town out back. They and other like-minded family and friends put on benefits for people to come watch. They put on shows for handicapped kids and people. 

The house was very dark and spooky and no matter the time of day or night, I always felt like someone was watching me. Every night I could hear someone walk, like they were walking from the back of the house to the front, wearing heavy boots. They would walk from the back through the dining room and kitchen and into the parlor or second living room (the house had hardwood floors), across the living room towards the small hall where the two bedrooms and bathroom were. 

It would walk down the hall to my parents' room, turn, and then walk to my and my sister's room and then I felt like it was standing there looking in. I could hear like heavy breathing, though I never saw anything because I kept my head covered or laid really still with my eyes closed. Then I could hear it turn and walk away and the footsteps fade off. Almost every time after they faded there was the sound of like someone breaking a plate glass window. 

For the longest time we would all jump up and go see what was broken but after time and time and time again of it happening, we just stopped getting up. This happened until my mom divorced my father and moved my sister and me to Louisiana. 

About a year before we moved, there was a really old lady that lived close by and my mother mentioned this to her. She said that a long time ago a worker was killed on the property so we figured it was him checking up on us. 

Several times, while playing in the sheds or the orchard, I felt like I was being watched. A friend of the family stayed the night because he and his wife had an argument. He was sleeping on the couch and we heard him say, ""Hey, get off my feet... I said get off my feet!"" We all went in to see what he was hollering about. When my dad hit the light switch, the family friend jumped up and said, ""I...I thought the kids were messing with me and sitting on my feet, but I don't think it was them."" He got dressed and left in the middle of the night and never stayed the night again. 

A couple times I would hear someone call my name, like they were far away, and I would think it was my mother and I would run to where she was at and ask what she wanted, I heard her call me, and she would say she didn't call me, but yeah she needed me because we were going somewhere or she would say she was fixing to call for me. But I swear it sounded just like her voice calling me even if I was way in the back of the property and she was in the house. 

The second haunting was when my husband, who was in the Navy, was stationed in Groton, Connecticut. We lived off base in a small house next to a big Victorian house (our land lady lived in it).

There were places very close by where there had been Civil War battles. One they had made into Griswold Park and another had the trenches still there and along the wall, off and up the embankment from the river, were the places they had set up cannons. They had a memorial marker in the middle of the field by a little spot with an iron fence surrounding it that talked about the General that had died on that spot. 

Anyway, one night we were walking back from a friend's house that lived on the other side of that battlefield. We had crossed through it to take a shortcut home. 

That night we were in bed, my husband asleep and our little dog on the floor by the bed. I had just started to drift off and I startled myself awake because I was crying and didn't even know it until the tears rolled down my face. 

All of a sudden there was this loud bang like a gun went off and a flash of light right in the room. The dog jumped in the bed and we both jumped out of bed and I ran to the window to see if maybe it was a car backfiring driving by, but there were no cars and no headlights or taillights going either way down the street. It kind of shook us up a bit but we went back to bed. The dog would not get out of our bed so we had to let him sleep with us. 

After a couple days, strange things started happening to just me. I would get up early and get my hubby off to the Base and then go back in and lay down to catch a few more zzzzs and every time I did, I would be half asleep and then try to get up but couldn't. I would fight and fight to get up but I couldn't even open my eyes. I wanted so bad to just relax and go to sleep but in the back of my mind I knew if I did, I would never wake up. This would happen every morning but never when my husband was there. 

The last time it happened before we moved. I had packed some boxes and my husband was at the Base getting his transfer orders, etc. I had picked up a book I had been reading and just felt so tired, so I set it on top of the little fridge, right in the middle, and went into the bedroom. 

I laid back on the bed and just barely closed my eyes when I was going through the same thing but I could sort of open my eyes and on the wall across from my bed I saw a swirling circle. I felt like I was being pulled towards it and I knew if I did, I was a goner but I couldn't move, not even my head. I tried and tried but still couldn't, and all of a sudden I heard a slam come from the kitchen that was right off our bedroom. It slammed hard enough it jolted me out of whatever was happening. 

I jumped up and ran in there, and on the other side of the kitchen was that book I had sat on top of the fridge. It was laying like it had been thrown against the wall. I always felt like someone saved me that day. 

My husband came home and I told him what happened. We finished packing and left right away, even though we had planned on staying that night and leaving in the morning. 

Third one was when my husband and I split up for a while. I moved into a small 2 bedroom apartment. Not long after I moved in, I would be sitting in the second bedroom where I kept my computer. After I got off work, I would chat with friends or write emails, etc every night. 

One night the lights started flashing in there and the door started closing on its own. At first I thought it just needed new light bulbs and it must be the a/c kicking on and making a draft. It happened several more times and I changed out the light bulbs and thought okay we're good now but it kept happening. 

Only the lights in there would flash, never lights in any other room and the door would start to slowly close. I had my landlord check out the lights. It was a ceiling fan type with the lights under it. He checked it all out and put new bulbs in it, although I already had. 

Once again I thought okay good but the next night, same thing. So the next night I made sure the a/c was off and I checked the bulbs, made sure they were screwed in tight... Same thing. Lights flickered and the door started closing. I got up and said, ""Okay, if there's someone here, stop it."" Oh, I forgot to mention I lived across the street from a cemetery, so I thought... Could be a visitor. 

This continued every night for a year... Every night. In my head I always pictured a man in a black suit for some reason. Anyway, one night my grandson, who was almost two at the time, was with me and we were in there and I was writing an email to my sister and it happened. My grandson, who was sitting beside me playing on the floor with some toys, looked out the door when I got up to block it open and got scared and kept pointing and saying something I couldn't understand, but you could tell he was scared to death. 

I looked out to where he was pointing but didn't see anything, so I asked him if he wanted a cookie. I picked him up and started out the door and he went nuts and tried to crawl over my shoulder to get away from whatever he was seeing. I finally got out part of what he was saying was man. I don't know why but it ticked me off and I hollered, ""Look! I don't know who you are but you are scaring my grandson and I WILL NOT put up with it so go the hell away."" 

My grandson stopped squeezing my neck, looked back towards the living room and said man gone. We went in and I got him a cookie and he was okay the rest of the night. 

He would spend almost every weekend with me but he had never said anything or acted scared, even when the lights flickered and door slowly start closing. It never closed all the way just halfway. But that night he saw something I couldn't. 

The next night my grandson was at his home and I was in the room chatting when the lights flickered and the door started closing. I jumped up, walked into the living room and said, ""Now listen hear. I don't know who you are or what you want, but do not EVER scare my grandkid again. If you need some help crossing over, need to say something to me, then let's have it. If not, go away and do not come back."" I don't know why, but I wasn't scared at all. It never happened again the last two months I lived there. My husband and I worked things out and have been together ever since. 

I haven't had any more experiences since except where I work at an early childhood program. We took our class on a field trip to see the police dept in the town I live in. We were standing looking at the two cells they used to hold prisoners until the bigger town could come pick them up and I started getting light headed and felt like I couldn't breath. You could just feel the heaviness of past people that were scared or upset, knowing they were in trouble. I got so nauseous and shaky. I told the other teacher I needed to get out of there. She looked at me and said, ""Oh my! You're pale as a sheet."" 

The police officer was leading us out and said, ""Oh, yeah. The reason we only use the cells as storage is because a few years ago someone hung themselves in one of them. I said, ""That one"" and pointed to the one on the right and he said yeah, then asked me if I was okay cause I was fixing to hurl. 

We got outside and I finally felt like I could take a deep breath and the nausea left. 

Well those are my stories. All true."
"Ghostly Voices","Kentucky","Family / Friends Visits","This story happened in Kentucky in 2017 and then again in 2019. My mother was ill for awhile and always said she never wanted to be placed in a old folks' home. She wanted a promise, so to make her feel better we said we wouldn't. But as it happens sometimes, her illness got worse we couldn't keep her at home anymore. We had to place her. 

I cried for two weeks, thinking I had broken a promise to her. She wasn't there for long before she passed in 2017, three months before her birthday.

Days after that, tired from all the commotion of the funeral, I was awoken from a sound sleep. I heard my mother call my name. I quickly got up out of bed and went to her room to see what she needed. But the bed was empty and I remembered she had passed. I went back to bed and cried. 

For two weeks this happened and every time I would automatically get up only to be greeted with an empty bed. It stopped after awhile and life went on.

Two years later, in 2019, my father got sick. His hospital stay was brief and he passed quickly. And again, for two weeks straight, I heard him call my name. I got up to go help him only to realize he had passed.

I know this may sound weird but I talk to my folks at times, telling them I love and miss them, things like that.

When alive both parents were a buffer to an in-law that would get creepy whenever we would talk, text or write. We would get in fights and he would get nasty and rude. With them both gone, he wants to text again. I simply asked, to myself, if trouble will come of this. For two weeks I'd wake up hearing yes. 

My questions are:

Was that my folks' voices I heard after they died?

Is this my folks warning me to stay clear of the creepy in-law?"
"I Believe Her","California","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","My good friend Gloria takes care of her 93 year old mother who has Alzheimer's and dementia. I have met Carmen (her mom) and have witnessed some of her ""episodes"", they seem to be getting worse. 

Lately, Carmen's health has been failing due to her not wanting to eat or spitting out her medicine. The only way Gloria gets her to eat is when she tells her that if she doesn't eat she's going to have to go to a nursing home. 

Gloria is the middle of 7 children, she had a really tough life growing up due to her mother disliking her. Her mother used to make her do all the cleaning and would physically and verbally abuse her. She would always tell her she was sorry she ever had her and that she wished she would have killed her when she was born. 

Carmen kicked Gloria out of the house when she was 15. She literally pushed her out the door in the middle of the night and told her to not come back, told her that she was dead to her. 

Throughout the years they rarely kept in touch. About 4 years ago Gloria got a call telling her that her mom had fallen and needed hip replacement surgery. After the surgery, the doctors told all the siblings that their mother could no longer live by herself and that if no one was willing to take her in, she needed to go to a nursing home. Well, they all said they didn't have the time or space to take care of their mother. 

Carmen cried and pleaded and looked Gloria straight in the eyes and begged her to take her to live with her. Gloria could not find it in her to say no. She tells me that part of her wanted to know how it felt to have a mother, she thought they could make amends and leave all the bad feelings behind. Of course she was wrong, her mother is still very nasty towards Gloria and is only nice to her when she needs something. 

A year after bringing her mother to live with her, Carmen was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. This only made matters worse, Carmen is always lashing out at Gloria and is verbally abusive. 

Now let me get to the weirdness. Lately, Carmen has been complaining that people come into her room at night and wake her up. She goes into Gloria's room very upset and tells her that there are people in her bedroom talking and won't let her sleep. She also yells at her and says ""Where are you hiding them? Where are the people that are making all that noise while I'm trying to sleep?""

She describes a little girl, about 5 years old, with a blue dress and ponytails, who always comes in her bedroom and stands by her bed and just stares at her. Carmen asks her who she is and what she wants, the little girl just giggles. When Carmen gets up and tries to come close to her, the little girl runs and hides behind a chair or goes in the closet, all the while laughing. 

Carmen will get up in the middle of the night and will go in Gloria's room, screaming at her and accusing her of having people over. She says there is a man that she knows was hired by Gloria to kill her, this man tells her that he wants her dead. Gloria has talked to her mom's doctors and is told that it is part of Carmen's dementia. 

I talk to Gloria maybe a couple of times a week and she will vent and tell me about her mom's latest shenanigans so I knew about her mom seeing people but Gloria never described in detail what her mom was seeing. Carmen remembers who I am and constantly asks Gloria to invite me over to have lunch with them. 

I was free one day a couple of weeks ago and went over after work for dinner. I was sitting in the living room talking to Carmen while Gloria was in the kitchen getting dinner ready. Right across from where I was sitting is Carmen's bedroom which, at the time, had the door half open. I heard a noise that made me turn and look in the bedroom and I swear I saw something run across the bedroom. It was really fast and I really couldn't make out who or what it was. The only thing I'm sure of is that it was something with blue clothes. 

I got so startled that I jumped a little and put my hand to my heart. Carmen didn't notice and kept on talking to me. I turned to look at Gloria but she didn't seem to notice either. I decided not to say anything, I didn't want to upset Carmen. 

Later we were sitting in the dining table having dinner and I kept hearing noises and mumbling coming from Carmen's room and the living room area. I asked if we had left the television on, we didn't. As I was saying my goodbyes and getting ready to leave, I clearly heard giggling. I got really freaked out, turned to look at Gloria and it appeared she had not heard anything. Carmen had already retired to her bedroom. I didn't say anything to Gloria, I just let myself out. 

A few days later I was talking to Gloria on the phone and she was telling me that her mom tells her about the little girl in her bedroom, so I asked her if the girl was someone Carmen knew that had already passed. Gloria said no and went on to describe the little girl as told to her by her mom. She told me about how she runs and hides around the bedroom and is always giggling, that gave me goosebumps. 

Gloria believes her mom is trying to get attention and just makes up excuses to be mean to her in the morning for having ""parties"" and not letting her get any sleep. Now I'm wondering if Carmen is actually seeing ghosts and it's not part of her dementia. I also wonder why Gloria has never seen or heard anything when I was there. Gloria was standing right next to me when I heard the giggling, why didn't she hear it. Am I coming down with dementia too?"
"Journey Of A Million Mothers","New York","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","Earth is a spiritual realm, and the membrane between planes of energy thin and permeable. Energy bodies move fluidly between worlds. 

I'm constructed in a way that I experience these energies through all of my senses. Clairvoyant, clairaudient, clairsentient. My experiences are rarely by choice. Something occurs and then, through investigation, I gain a deeper clarity into what I saw, heard, or felt. 

There came a point that I was naive enough to think I had seen spirit in all its manifestations, shades, lights and orbs. I recall watching the film, ""The Sixth Sense"" when it first came out and thinking, great film; however, spirit does not appear that way! I've changed my mind since. 

In this multidimensional universe, there are copious types of manifestations with different vibrations and intentions. The background to this story is relevant to the sighting, but I'll drag you through as little of my murky circumstance as possible. This siting took place in rural Putnam County, New York, in 2011. 

Six years prior to this event, my marriage came to a sudden and tumultuous end and my life was scattered and torn. I had been a stay-at-home parent, published but not yet degreed, and out of the workforce in any meaningful way for years. I couldn't find a viable job and the challenges of poverty were degrading and oppressive. 

I lost everything. My ex-husband had stopped working, moved in with his boyfriend and my younger daughter had to take residence with them. I was five years into my older daughter's medically-induced addiction that progressed to heroin. 

To say my heart was broken is a grand understatement. I was living in the upside down and the separation from my children was a harrowing experience that I don't believe I'll ever fully recover from.

My older daughter wandered after her first rehab and would go missing. I would go searching, texting, calling, sometimes to find her in emergency rooms, other times take her to emergency rooms. She was in and out of rehabs and hospitals. The only thing that kept me going was hope and, at times, there was barely enough of it to get me through the day. If my life was trial by fire, my temporary move into the unwelcoming house of my mother and her husband was gasoline. 

On this early autumn day, I went outside to be alone and sit by the rushing stream. I pulled up a chair by the water and began to journal. I wasn't sitting long when I felt a presence peering through the trees and glanced up from my book. There was someone there. She was standing on the bridge that crosses the stream connecting the driveway to the path leading to the house. This entity was unlike any I had seen before. My heart started to race! 

She had no features but a well-defined form. She was the shape of a woman in a Victorian dress with a bustle and bonnet, indicative of the 1800's. She was a white milky, translucent color. I immediately turned my eyes away hoping she would vanish, but when I looked up, she lingered in my glance much longer than I anticipated. 

This apparition had an intensity to her and I must admit, she unnerved me. I decided to try and let it go. I reminded myself that I was safe. I decided to add it to the list of new experiences, assuming it would be a one-time occurrence. 

About a week had passed. I was sitting on the computer looking for work, and turned my eyes to the window. The ghost had returned! She was across the lawn by the bridge, anxiously pacing in one direction and then the other, her arms behind her back! Her urgency put me in full panic. What was she trying to tell me? Was she there to warn me about something? Was I going to die? Was someone else going to die? She seemed upset and frantic! I contacted two people who I thought might have insight and they both gave me my own advice, ""Ask her what she wants."" In the week that followed I did just that. I got quiet and put the question out into the universe. 

One evening I was in my quarters, when I turned around and she was right there. Her body half in this realm and half outside this dimension. I noticed a dark red line down the front of her dress, and to this day, I wonder what it was. It was the color of blood but straight and contained and started midpoint in her body. In this visit, she disappeared as quickly as she showed herself. Maybe my fear closed the gap between our worlds! It wasn't that I thought she was there to cause me harm, but her anguish and distress scared me. I wasn't clear on what she was trying to communicate. It was my first experience of this nature and third visitation! 

I truly didn't know what else to do, so I went on the computer and randomly typed in ""White Lady"" because that was the first thing that came into my mind! I had no expectation of anything coming up and when it did, I was shocked. Shocked and relieved! Apparently this apparition has been spotted around the world, mostly in rural areas. The sightings have been most prominent in parts of the United States, Ireland and Great Britain. The story is slightly different in each country, as is her presentation in her white gown. 

The white lady has been seen so frequently throughout parts of the world that she has become a legend of tragedy. Some say she comes to warn of a death. A common theme is the loss of a daughter or husband. Most commonly, it's said that her daughter went missing and was never found. Grieving, she continues to search the earth for her child. She's known to be on the aggressive side, particularly to men.

I didn't want to frighten anyone, so at first I chose not to mention it to my mother or her husband. Then things started happening around the house over the next couple of weeks. I heard my mother scream in the kitchen. A bowl that had been pushed far back on the shelf, as she tells it, came flying off and just missed her. She and her husband were walking outside when a huge branch came crashing down from a tree just missing them. A metal marble hit the floor with such impact that we all heard it from another room and, once the cause of the noise was located, no one could identify the marble as being remotely familiar.

A more profound moment in this experience was when my younger daughter came for the weekend. I went into the bathroom to get washed when she started banging on the door. ""Are you okay, Mom?"" I was a bit surprised by the concern in her voice. ""Yes!"" I replied, ""I'm getting washed!"" When I returned to the room my daughter swung around on the computer chair and looked at me. ""Are you okay?"" She asked again. ""I'm fine! Why are you asking?"" ""Mom, I heard you sobbing!"" I explained to her that I wasn't, but she didn't believe me. I didn't tell her about the ghost for a while. My daughter was having a clairaudient experience.

During that same month, another ghost, in full human form, dressed in farmer overalls, covered in dirt and carrying a tool, passed by my bedroom window. It was dusk, but he was clear as day! He didn't move in the same way as a living being, and I got the sense that he died while working in the field. Maybe even buried alive because there was so much dirt on him. I was stunned. It was the second entity on this property that was in a form I had never seen before. He looked out in front of him with a blank expression as if I wasn't even there. He appeared to me only that one time. I assumed there was no connection between the farmer and the white lady other than location. 

Then, I came across a myth surrounding the white lady that states it's believed she had a daughter who was violently murdered by a farmer. Perhaps a connection? I can't be sure. 

The white lady ghost was full of intent and a powerful force. She wasn't just casually passing through or wandering aimlessly. She made noise, she made her presence known and she was bold. She showed herself to me three times and grieved loudly enough for my clairaudient daughter to hear her cries. Why did she come to me? I do question this. Did she come to forewarn me of the imminent death of my missing daughter?

A year and half ago my older daughter died at twenty-eights years old, suddenly and suspiciously on the morning she was supposed to be released from the hospital. 

Perhaps the white lady ghost is fragments of millions of grieving mothers, spinning and vibrating throughout the world so fervently that it gives rise to form. The cumulative soul of the grieving mother. Whatever or whoever she is, I do know, she unquestionably walks the earth."
"Multiple Shadows In Room At Night And Other Phenomena","Massachusetts","Haunted Places","My name is Joe, I hope my first name will be sufficient. I am a 33 year old man living in Massachusetts in my own home. Along with me is my son, age 8, and my girlfriend and her three children, ages 9, 7, and 4. The children are with us a little more than half the time, as we both share custody with our respective ex's. They have only recently moved in the past few weeks, while my son as been with me since birth. I also have three dogs, all of which are very well trained, but protective of the family and property should someone attempt to come around when we are not home. 

First, I have lived in this home for 9 years, some of the time I was married but the majority of the time I've been single. For as long as I have lived there, I have seen multiple black shadows moving around my room at night. These shadows range from human-sized to massive, blob-like shapes covering an entire quarter of the ceiling, usually in a corner over my bed. They move in such an odd way, seemingly gliding and swirling, akin to a lava lamp. 

For the most part they tend to move around my bed, either settling directly over me near the ceiling or coalescing, standing at the side or foot of my bed. On a few occasions I have had them come so close as to block out my vision completely, and I had to back up to realize that it was literally ""face to face"". I say that in quotations because I HAVE NEVER seen a face or any detail. They are rarely in human shape, even if they are the size of an average man, it looks more like a mist or funnel cloud than a human form. 

I have always felt uneasy, but never genuinely threatened. I am not the only person to witness these shadows, and at the time I am always awake, clear headed and typically blink several times and rub my eyes to ensure I am seeing what I am seeing and it's not just a trick of the eyes in a nearly pitch black room. I do believe in the paranormal, but I would consider myself a healthy sceptic. My first instinct isn't ""it's a ghost"" or ""it's a demon"". That being said, recently in my home these shadows have appeared more often than not, and I have had other things occur that I cannot readily explain.

I have, within the last few months, heard what sounds like footsteps when I am alone in the house and the dogs are all sleeping or in my line of sight. The dogs do react to the footsteps, but rarely bark, more of a perked ear and investigative look rather than a show of force. 

I have been woken up to what sounds like conversation in my living room. Thinking I left the television on prior to going to bed I get up to turn it off only to have it go completely silent when I get close to the living room and the television is off. 

Lastly, this past week, a glass dish was drying on my drying rack among other dishes. It had been washed close to 4 hours before, and had sat in room temperature the rest of the time. I would say ""broke"" but that's not accurate; ""exploded"" would be a better term for it. This occurred at approximately 2:30am, and I was in the living room, while my girlfriend was in the bedroom. The ""POP"" of the glass was enough to wake her on the opposite side of the house and was enough to scare the living crap out of me. No other dishes moved, no other dishes were affected, and there were shards of glass literally 15 feet away from the drying rack. It does not sit near a window, nor a vent for temperature fluctuations. I am at a complete loss of what caused it to shatter so violently. 

Anybody with any kind of insight into what is occurring in my home out there I ask to please share what you know; I am open to any suggestions to explain the phenomena. Thank you all, and my you find peace, happiness and love in your lives."
"Andrew Jackson's Hermitage Mansion","Tennessee","Haunted Places","During the 90's I think it was (I have been more than once), I and my wife visited Andrew Jackson's Nashville, TN home The Hermitage. Andrew Jackson, if he doesn't immediately ring a bell, is the 7th President of the United States and is featured on the $20 bill. The President and his family are laid to rest only steps from the home.

 During this particular visit, the tour guide took us through the various rooms of the home. It was in the Dining Room that an odd thing happened. A piece of the fireplace log cradle, that holds wood that burns in the fireplace, fell over. I commented something to the effect,"" How did that happen?"" and stated matter of factly,""This place must be haunted."" The guide said not one word but her facial expression said everything. She looked very flushed and even afraid.

 The fireplace was NOT lit and there was NO wind. Even if there had been wind those are forged of very HEAVY Iron and it would likely take a very strong gust of wind, almost a tornado, to move them as I would guess they are most likely original and therefore probably made in the 1800's. Others might say well the floor jarred as you walked by. They evidently don't know about how fireplaces were constructed during the 1800's. They were built to the ground through the basement or crawl space of stone or brick.

 I have read elsewhere that others have experienced activity at the home. I had even read stories, related by others, that some employees have experienced things themselves. There are reports of at least one employee, that I think it was said, she would not be in the mansion after dark, nor be alone in the house as well.

 If you have a chance to visit, ask the Park Service guides if they know of reports. I bet you will be surprised.

 I have noticed before that I am ""sensitive"" to occurrences and I can relate other happenings in future posts as well. If you have experienced anything at the Hermitage itself or have another similar experience, please share your experience."
"Edith's House","Georgia","Haunted Places","Finding a place to sit in the home of my Great Aunt is an experience that isn't easily forgotten. She is a hoarder; though not as afflicted as are the poor souls that you see on those television shows about hoarding interventions. When I visit someone, I feel uncomfortable moving piles of their personal items, just to sit in a chair. 

She lives in Dalton and is in her late eighties. I will call her ""Edith"" because she looks like an Edith; she is the sweetest woman on Planet Earth and any person who visits her will leave her house a few pounds heavier as she is convinced that everyone is hungry.

Edith has lived in the same house since the early 1960's. When she was married to her first husband, the house was a basic split level. It had all of the bedrooms on the second floor with the garage below them. To the right of this garage, on the first floor, there were the functional rooms of the house; kitchen, living room, dining room and so on. 

There were stairs that, theoretically, led down into a finished basement; it was all theoretical to me because I was born in 1981 and, since that event took place, I have had no reason to believe that her basement exists. Clutter has blocked the entry to the basement on every single occasion that I have been there. I do know that there is a door called: ""The Basement Door"".

My mother says that Edith wasn't a hoarder before her first husband died. He died of a heart attack in early 1970, right before my mother turned nine years old. 

My mother has told me of many of her own sightings of her dead uncle or of evidence that he was still around. One sticks with me; a week or two after her uncle's funeral, she said that she was sleeping in the guest bedroom and that she was awoken by the heavy scent of flowers. The scent was so strong that she described it as being a hindrance to her breathing. She got out of bed and rubbed her eyes; the room was faintly lit by the overhead light in the hallway that came through the open bedroom door. When she looked up, she saw her uncle looking out of a wall mounted mirror. 

He was not looking at her; he was looking in the direction of the open door and the hallway light. She said that he was wearing his funeral clothing. Maybe he was looking for Edith.

My mother said that she jumped back in the bed and hid under the covers. If it was ME that saw him, I would have calmly walked out of there and they would have found me sleeping on the couch. ""Calmly"" because it's the people who run like maniacs who are the ones who get caught; it matters very little what you run from. 

Her reasoning behind her actions was that she was more afraid of getting on her mother's (my Grandmother's) nerves than she was of any ghost. She also said that her uncle had always been kind to her and she was only afraid because she knew he was compelled to be there for some reason.

She never told Edith that she saw him. Edith was very heartbroken at that time and she knew it would make her aunt upset to have to hear ""ghost stories"" about her husband.

So, my mother told me about it two decades later. The awesome power of suggestion has caused me to be wary of having a mirror anywhere near my bed.

In 1975, Edith got married to her second husband. I barely remember him because he died young too; he had a brain tumor. Throughout the late seventies and early eighties, he made a few additions to the house. The lot that the house was on looked like a normal size from the street but the backyard went back for a long way; it was into this backyard that he made the additions. 

Originally, there was a door in the living room that led outside into a small garden area. Edith doesn't have much of a green thumb but she is very optimistic about growing things. The plants in her garden were struggling for life (or for a humane death) so it was no big deal to move the whole enterprise to another side of the yard. He removed the door and made a kind of short hallway. 

Someone with a surreal sense of interior design had fixed the walls of this hallway with frameless mirrors; top to bottom and end to end. Nothing stood in the way of seeing yourself reflected off into infinity; not even darkness. Coming from that, he built a long family room and at the end of that was a larger master bedroom and bathroom.

After I started to grow older, there were less opportunities to visit Edith in Dalton. My mother and I stayed in her home once when I was twenty years old; there was a wedding going on with a second cousin that I can't even remember the name of. Edith's house was filled to capacity on that occasion and I had to sleep on an uncomfortable couch in the new living room. This couch was quite close to the hallway between the two living rooms.

The couch looked lovely but it was one of those Victorian reproductions that are really most useful as a decorative item. They certainly make an awkward bed! I was lying down forever, trying to convince myself that I was comfortable and tired. It was while I was trying to cope with the couch that I heard someone walking in the old living room. I could hear the speed of their footsteps and knew that the only place anyone could be going was either to see me or Edith, in her bedroom. They weren't just wandering around.

My line of sight from the couch enabled me to see through the hall of mirrors and into a corner of the old living room. So, as I listened to the approaching footsteps, I closed my eyes and pretended to be asleep; I didn't feel like having any more conversations with anyone. I heard the footsteps pause before the mirrors and I peeked from between my eyelashes and saw no one.

As soon as I saw nothing, the footsteps continued coming down the hall towards me. They sounded as if they were wearing heavy shoes and they paused again at the threshold of the room. There was nothing there. I wanted to believe that it was someone walking upstairs but it was very obvious to me that the sound was coming from the hardwood floor of the hallway; that part of the house was only one floor, anyway.

Edith had invested quite a small fortune in night lights so it was never really nighttime anywhere except for in the closets and the inaccessible basement. I had enough light to see. I didn't hear the footsteps retreat back down the hall and they didn't come in the room where I was. I sat up; even though I saw nothing there but mirrors reflecting each other, my mind told me that a man was standing there.

It was really unnerving. I put my headphones on and rolled over. I felt confident that there wasn't any harm meant in what was happening and more confident that he wasn't able to pass into the new section of the house. I thought it was Edith's first husband, looking after her now that she was alone again.

I don't remember how long it took me to fall asleep but I felt terrible the next day. I remember having an omelet for breakfast.

I came back to Edith's house in September of 2019 and the house is even more stuffed with objects than it ever was. She got married to another man a few years ago... God bless her. When they got married, she was 85 and he was 89. He doesn't even live with her because he can't move around in the house; he has his own house nearby.

I don't think there is anything to be worried about with Edith or her house. I think that the footsteps that I heard were, maybe, residual. There used to be a small porch where the hallway is and maybe my Great Uncle used to have a routine about standing there. If he really is there, maybe he just wants to be sure that Edith is happy.

Thank you for reading my story!"
"I Think We Saw A Ghost At The Amityville Haunted House","New York","Haunted Places","I posted this somewhere else but thought I'd post it here too. I've wanted to tell other people about this but I feel like nobody will believe me, which is why I thought about sharing this here. This happened during summer break after my freshman year of high school in 2017. I and my mom went to go visit New York. It hadn't even been a year since I came to the US, which is why my mom wanted to show me different states like NY and NJ. I was pretty excited, and my mom showed me around the cities which was super fun.

It was also around the time I started reading about haunted places in America and scary stuff like that in different websites. I heard about the Amityville House, and I heard that they made several movies and a book about it, even though I hadn't watched them. So, I told my mom that we should go look at it, since we were in NY and didn't know if we were coming back. She said 'sure why not', so we drove all the way to Long Island and finally reached the house. I wanted to take pictures and brag to my friends about the scary place we went to, so we got out of the car and took some videos.

It was kind of cloudy and dark outside and it felt super eerie considering the fact that a whole family was murdered there. There was a cop car patrolling around the neighborhood and we didn't want to seem like we were going to break in or anything, so we looked at the house a bit and then drove back to our hotel. Nothing weird yet.

 After we got to our hotel, I looked at the videos and pictures I took of the house and this one particular video got my attention. I zoomed into the different windows of the house in the video and in one of them, you could clearly see a white smoke like thing go back and forth and disappear. It was definitely not a person, and I'm 100% sure there was nothing particular around that could've let out smoke.

It just appeared, moved around a little bit and then disappeared. It's texture was like smoke but I'm pretty definitely sure it wasn't smoke. The best way I can describe it is that it looked like the Japanese floating balls of fire ghosts, called Onibi. I thought I was seeing things so I showed it to my mom and she was genuinely terrified as well. As much as I'm interested in the paranormal, I like to remain skeptical, so I posted the video on my spam account on Instagram wondering if my friends thought it was weird or not.

A few of my friends DMed me saying that they saw the thing and it definitely did not look like smoke. I was so surprised that it might actually be a real ghost we caught on video because of all the theories that the Amityville haunting was a hoax. I didn't really think much of it but it creeped me out a little bit. I later forgot about it and after about a year and a half, I remembered about the video and thought about posting it on Reddit. So I scrolled through my camera roll and looked for it everywhere, but of course it was gone. I even logged into my old spam account and the video wasn't on there either. No I hadn't changed phones or anything.

I asked my mom if she remembers the video and she said yes of course, she was mad I lost it because it seemed like we actually caught something terrifying on camera. I asked my friends who saw the post and they said they definitely remembered it as well, but I couldn't find the video anywhere. I feel like the reason this is so hard to believe is because I'm claiming to have video evidence of it but I don't have it because it got deleted somehow. I really wish I still had it so I could post it here and maybe get an explanation of it: ("
"Timmy My Poltergeist","Indiana","A Haunted Life","I have multiple ghosts in my home. They have been with me my entire life; I'm used to them. Just recently I thought there was a new ghost in my family's home, but soon I figured out it was a poltergeist.

 Me and my sister like naming our ghosts so we can tell which ghost is currently with us, before you say something about how you can't see ghosts so how do you know which ghost or ghosts is with you, certain ghosts normally just hang out in a certain room. I named the poltergeist Timmy, he is only ever in the kitchen.

 Timmy acts like a 6 year old little boy, I say this because he likes opening and closing the cabinets. Whenever we are about to go on vacation or a trip, Timmy throws a tantrum. Timmy never hurts anyone so we are comfortable being in the same room as him. 

 Whenever Timmy first showed up I personally didn't know what to think, I just thought it was another ghost or one of our already present ghosts that decided to hang in our kitchen. Timmy has only been here for about 2 months and hasn't caused that much trouble except for not letting anyone sleep, he is very active at night. For people that say I need to get rid of the ghosts, trust me I tried, but it didn't work. The ghosts that are currently in my home are the only ones I let in because they don't cause trouble."
"Meeting Ghost Of Live Person","California","Misc","I am a new member, but not new to ghost experiences. I need some feed back about my recent experiences.

A little about myself. I have always had experiences with spirits, ghosts and nightmares and I can still remember each one since I was a little girl. More about that later. 

I am 53 now and live in California. I have had a new kind of experience and would like some insights and thoughts about it please. It's not scary, just interesting. It happened like this.

I was in my bedroom which has a window that looks to the front of the property. I could hear voices, but couldn't see anyone. I thought try the binoculars, why not. Well, that's when I saw a fairly tall dark skinned man from the, I'd say, old west days. He was looking straight at me. He was wearing a long black leather trench coat and leather hat, the kind Clint Eastwood would wear in his movies as a cowboy. I put down the binoculars to look again but couldn't see him. With the binoculars there he was again. 

There were other figures that came up to him and would leave, but he never moved his body but would move his head from looking at me to looking at the other persons. Okay, well I put this off as I am imaging things and let it go. Besides what was I do anyways? 

I moved from there to another location and town but not far away. I say it had been about 4 months since the sighting, I was asked to a birthday party. I went to this party and all of a sudden another invited guest comes in and I about fell over. This man was identical, including the hat and coat, to who I had seen. Wow, all I could think of was I've met you before.

Why would this happen? Anyone with any thoughts on this?

Thanks for reading.

"I Think I Saw An Angel","Kentucky","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I was quite at young at the time this happened. I would venture to say that I was no older than 7.

 Before my parents divorced, my family lived in Kentucky. The home was built in 1910. My siblings and I have reports of odd things happening, but this is the most upsetting one for me. During my time in the house, I frequently experienced disturbing recurring nightmares. The atmosphere of the house was unsettling and tense. I was never very happy there. 

One night, I had woken up very late. I decided that I didn't want to sleep in my bedroom alone, so I walked down the short hall to my brothers' room and started setting up a sleeping arrangement on the toy chest at the end of their bed. As I was doing this, I turned to the right and looked at the doorway adjacent to me. I saw an angelic, beautiful woman standing there. She had a flower crown and white garment on. She just stood there looking at me carefully and calmly. I froze with fear. It felt like the wind was knocked out my chest and I felt a rush of adrenaline.

 I regained as much composure I had at the age of 7 and booked it to my parents room, which was connected to my brothers' room luckily. I hid on my mother's side of the bed that blocked sight of the doorway. I stuck my head under the covers that draped over the bed and never felt so helpless. The unsettling ambiance that my father's CPAP created did not help the situation. My mother wouldn't wake up and I was not willing to risk being seen in order to wake my father. I peeked out from the side of the bed and she was not longer in the doorway. I still did not feel safe moving so I slept on the floor that night, halfway under the bed.

 I have a suspicion that this experience may have sparked a streak of disturbing existentialism while we lived in the house. Many nights I would come to my mother crying and telling her of my fear of death and inquiring about the afterlife. I'm sure it worried her, given that I couldn't have been older than 7 at the time, but it came to a stop shortly after we moved. 

I'm not sure if anyone has anything similar to this experience or has any commentaries on it, but please do not hesitate to leave your thoughts in the comments. Before I end the story I would particularly like to hear what people think of the ""angel"". I have always been very wary on the intentions and origins of her, but I also have no other definitive I.D. Of her. The memory of her instills great panic in me and I feel intensely paranoid just writing about this incident. I apologize if this feels rushed and/or unorganized and I thank you for taking the time to read this."
"Musical Ghost","New York","Haunted Places","I play the piano, as do my father and brother. We have a baby grand piano in our living room, which is right off our foyer. The foyer has the staircase leading upstairs, which is where my bedroom is. Last night, I can't be sure if I was awake or not, but I heard a piano key be pressed down, then something like a few clicks or footsteps or something. I remember shivering and pulling the covers over my head, and then getting up to use the bathroom. I usually cover my alarm clock at night because the light bothers me, so I did not know what time it was. Then, I lightly heard another key. The keys were the notes A (flat?) and C. (Look them up) I ran into my parent room, both of them were sound asleep. I ran into my brother's room, both were again, sound asleep. Nothing on the piano close to the keys was heavy enough to trigger a sound. My house has a burglar alarm, but we do not use it often. We live in a fairly safe neighborhood, and for all I know, the only robberies in my town were planned.

This was either early in the morning, or late in the night. Everyone but me was asleep. 

I can't really be sure what this was due to the fact the no one else but my family was in my house.

I also saw a bright light after that, and it looked like my christmas tree lights were plugged in. Then, I blinked and they were gone. 

I am also a writer of short horror/ghost stories and I wonder if my believing in the paranormal has something to do with this. No one else in my family believes in ghosts."
"Is My Mom Trying To Tell Us Something?","Oregon","Family / Friends Visits","My mother died on Mothers' day 2012, she was home in NC when it happened. My cousin called me while they were getting ready for her funeral. She said she found a book behind her couch she's never seen before?! It's called ""Heaven Is For Real."" It's a true story of a little boy that died and came back and told what he saw.

 Later I went with my boyfriend to see his mom on Mothers' day. His mother is not a believer and said someone gave her a book when her daughter died, she said she'd like for me to have it. I almost fainted, it was the SAME BOOK my cousin found behind her couch?! 😳 I couldn't wait to call my cousin back home in NC to tell her what happened. She said...""do ya think aunt Margie is trying to tell us something?!"" That was my mom's name. It blew our minds! 🙃🙏

Messages From Beyond

Yesterday I had a doctor appointment with a doctor I'd never seen before. I wasn't sure where I was going. As I kept driving I realized I was in my mother's old neighborhood.

I hadn't been in that part of town since she died on Mothers' day, 7 years ago. All kinds of memories came flooding in, stirring up mixed emotions of sadness and happiness as I passed the street she used to live on.

On the way home from the doctor's office I turned on the radio, The Eagles were on, playing one of my mom's favorite songs. I just had to laugh, she had an old Eagles tape and would play it every time we got in her car. One day I told her if she didn't play something else I was going to throw it out of the window!

As I was coming up on the street she use to live on, I heard part of the lyrics to her favorite song...""this voice keeps whispering in my ear, telling me I may never see you again!"" ""But I get a peaceful easy feeling, and I know you won't let me down!"" 😳🎵

I got chills as I passed her street and heard that song. I wondered if it were her playing it to send me a message. I wish we'd have gotten along better when she was alive. 🖤"
"Hearing Mom's Voice And Baby Crying When No One Is There","New York","Haunted Places","Over the years that I have lived in my current house, a few paranormal things have approached me. Before I was born, I had a sister that passed due to complications with her blood. I live in a very religious house, and my relatives always tell me she is always watching over me. Occasionally, when I am staying home alone, I will hear footsteps, or something fall in a different room. Once, a broom fell over directly behind me, while I was home alone.

 Last night, I heard someone who sounded like my mom calling my name, twice. She did it first at about 9:49 PM, while I was in bed early, trying to fall asleep. Then, preceding a baby's cry, a series of small clicks. This was the first time the activity had escalated. The voice also sounded like it was right in the next room, but my mother was watching television with my father in the den. If she had called me from there, I would not have heard her. My sister died in December, which of course is our current month, so could she have come back... To remind us? Again, I have a very religious family. So is it true that maybe she came back?

Again, a lot of things had fallen when I was home alone. Our power flickers often, and I know for a fact that my parents pay all of our bills. 

I forgot to mention that in the house I used to live in, I would often see a small silhouette climbing up our staircase, which faces my bedroom directly, and then the silhouette would stare into my room, and then run away. This would happen every night, and once the footsteps kept me up all night. I would stare into the hallway, and often see shadows on the walls. My parent never saw anything. Any help with this situation?"
"My Unnatural Experience","Colorado","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","When we moved our family to a rural mountain community in Colorado back in 2000, it wasn't long until I was able to return to my former hobby, hunting. We needed our children to be old enough to either partake in hunting or be able to be at home alone until we got off the mountain. In 2016 I drew an elk Tag. I don't remember how many days into our hunt we were, but I truly will never forget my very unnatural experience.

When hunting, it's an unwritten rule, you need to be in place at least an hour before sun rise. That being said, of course we weren't in place before sunrise, after all we are parents and the kids come first. When my husband and I arrived at what I now refer to as Indian Meadows, we were truly surprised to find the timber surrounding the meadow had been logged out, the previously beautiful mountain meadow now resembled a nuclear bomb site. The barren landscape left one feeling devastated, angry and very depressed. We hiked into the meadow past multiple pieces of large logging equipment. The acrid smell of Diesel fuel laid heavily upon the wet mountain air even without the monstrous machines running.

After hiking in about a half mile, I posted at a tree with a clear view of the meadow. A knee injury has left me permanently unable to hike the mountain sides like a true huntsman. It wasn't long before the wet air spread the moisture upon me, first in the form of rain which quickly changed to snow.

While my husband walked through the timbers above me attempting to drive any elk on the side of the mountain down toward me, I sat and watched the once beautiful tree circled meadow, all I could see and feel was ugliness, the ugliness of greed from the profit that the harvested timber would bring someone, the ugliness of the old equipment rusted from years of exposure to the harsh mountain elements, and the ugliness of the cold wet moisture permeating my bright fluorescent orange hunting attire. I knew I resembled a human orange popsicle, but I didn't really care, thankfully hunting isn't a high fashion sport!

After what seemed like a long amount of time, sitting with my back to the remaining pine and aspen trees that lined the north side of the meadow, I heard behind me a very promising commotion. Branches being snapped and the baritone thud of hooves hitting the ground, echoed down the hill side to where I was patiently waiting. This was it, my husband's drive of the mountainside above had worked, my elk tag would be filled and I could get out of the God forsaken frigid wet weather, a successfully completed hunt once again under my belt.

I positioned myself for a clear shot in the meadow once the elk above exited the cover of the dark timber. My rifle resting upon my shooting sticks readily awaiting my prey, which I CAN MOST DEFINITELY hear charging down the mountain side. I sat there anxiously awaiting for them to appear within my rifle sights, to where I can easily place the crosshairs of my scope on that exact spot vital organs lay beneath for a quick and painless as possible kill.

I waited, but nothing! I could still hear the deep thud of hooves upon the frozen ground. Where were they, where are the elk? Suddenly, BAM! Something hit me, I could feel the force of the hit, but nothing was around me. Nothing had run upon me, I saw nothing hit me, but I most definitely felt it. Yes, I definitely felt something hit me! As I looked forward, in front of me I saw something I had never witnessed before that day. I saw an Indian! No, not physically, but in a shimmering outlined form that I could literally see through. I was stunned and couldn't move. I sat there surely my mouth agape looking at and through this form, utterly confused, as he looked back at me. I could see the outline of the 2 feathers in his braided hair, the lance in his right hand which also bore a couple feathers, and his body and legs down to his knees, as he sat astride a horse that I also could only see the outline of to its midline. There were no colors to the outline. Nothing was exchanged, no words, no expressions, no nothing, he just simply faded away. I was left sitting at the bottom of that hillside not only wet from the now heavy wet falling snow but perplexed beyond what one's mind could possibly absorb.

I really did hear the breaking and snapping of branches and the roaring thud of running hooves that day, but NOTHING ever emerged from the trees, no elk or deer, and those noises stopped once whatever hit me had hit me. Colorado is a state rich in Native American history. Throughout the centuries many different tribes have called this beautiful state home, the Utes, Comanches, Cheyenne, Apache, Arapaho and many more. I have looked at images on the internet of various pictures of warriors from all these tribes, I know not what tribe he was from or when he lived, if he was riding through me off to battle or to hunt elk like me, all I know is that of what I saw and felt that day, I really did see and feel. I have only shared this story a few times until now, as I am afraid those who don't know me wouldn't believe me, I know I wouldn't if it hadn't happened to me."
"A Fistfight With A Ghost","Indiana","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I joined the Army fresh out of high school and since then lived in dozens of places and this has happened in only 1 place. Huntertown, Indiana. I was living in a 2 story townhouse. And I lived alone. Well at night from time to time I could feel something petting me. More like stroking my back. My neck down my back, always my neck and down my back. And whatever was touching me was touching me so hard I would wake up. I thought it was a serial killer that broke in and was petting me so it could savor the moment before they made their killing blow. I would wake up and would open my eyes but would lay very still to see if I could still feel it, and I could so I knew I wasn't dreaming it. I would flip over real fast and there was nothing there. This happened several times. The touch was cold and made my body tingle wherever it touched me. I eventually spoke to my mom and stepdad about things and my friends and they all thought I was dreaming. But I knew I wasn't. Well 1 night it happened again and this time as soon as I woke I flipped over and there was a man standing there next to my bed. 

He was there just standing there. I couldn't make out his features. But his frame in the moonlight was unmistakable. So I let out this spine chilling scream that woke the neighbors. I jumped out of bed and started swinging on this guy with both hands with everything I had, screaming at him. But the thing was my hands just went through him. After several swings I stopped and just looked. The guy did the same thing the whole time. He just slowly slipped towards the wall. Once he reached it he just faded into the wall and the floor. He was made of what appeared to be smoke, ash, and light. The whole time he just moved through my punches, and just kept moving after I stopped. Slowly, without concern. After that I slept on the couch or I had company come over more often. But I don't remember it touching me ever again. This is a 100% true story. I don't want anything for it, I just want to tell it."
"Paranormal Entity In Upstate Ny","New York","Haunted Places","It was a normal Monday evening and I met up with my friend how I usually do. However, instead of playing video games we had decided to go out and explore an old abandoned building near one of our houses. We had been there before in the past so we knew our way around pretty well.

 Once we got there we snuck in through a broken window which was at one point was blocked by a piece of plywood. There was some light that allowed us to see and navigate through. Security sometimes surveils the building so we had to be cautious. Once we made it inside we began to walk around and explore different parts of the building. We saw mostly trash and graffiti but nothing out of the ordinary.

 When looking around my buddy said he heard a door close. I hadn't heard anything though so I told him that his mind could be messing with him and he should just relax. We did stay on the lookout though for other people as we did not want to confront anyone else. We finally got to a stairwell that leads to the basement of the building. I went ahead first and as I was walking down the stairs I felt a hand touch my shoulder. I quickly turned around to see if it was my buddy only to find him several steps behind me.

He asked me ""What's wrong?""

I communicated to him that I felt something touch my shoulder and that I thought he was trying to get my attention. He denied it was him and showed me he couldn't reach me from where he was on the staircase. At the time, I dismissed my experience and just concluded that it was my imagination. When we finally reached the bottom of the staircase we continued our exploration while joking around about past events in high school. As we made our way through a series of rooms we reached a long hallway that had giant pipes that ran along the side of it. They were orange and bright which was the most unusual color in the whole building. At this point, we had been at the building for a while and thought about taking a picture to post on our social media accounts. I suggested that he should go first since he's more photogenic than I am. Once we found the ideal angle for the picture, we went ahead and took it. Once the picture was captured I took a look at it and noticed a dark shadow next to my friend. I was puzzled at first wondering if it was my shadow only that I had not seen anything like it before I took the photo and would have noticed if my shadow was in the frame. At this point, my friend noticed something was up and asked to take a look at the photo. I watched as face grew wary as he stared at the photo. I asked him what he thought it was and he was just as confused as I. Fear began to seep in and we began to feel a sense of dread.

I asked him, ""You think it's a ghost?""

He nodded. At this point, I began to worry about our well being and no longer felt safe where we were. I suggested we head out immediately. Before he could answer a feeling of disgust swept the hallway and before he could answer I already started heading towards the stairwell. Everything after that moment went by so fast. Before we knew it, we were in my car and my mind was all but a blur. We sat in the car silent only to look at each other with a sense of relief. At this point, I suggested we get something to eat to take our mind off the whole incident which he agreed to.

Since then neither of us has really talked about the incident although I plan on bringing it up with him soon. I cannot help but keep looking at the picture I took as I am confident that what I caught is a picture of a paranormal entity.

Thank you for reading my story and I was hoping to hear about what people might think it is. I appreciate all the help and support in advance!"
"Am I Cursed? Or Is My Mind Playing Tricks On Me","South Dakota","Haunted Places","Last spring I went on a road trip to Deadwood, SD, with my best friend and his girlfriend. On the way there we drove through Badlands National Park, which is one of the most incredible places I've ever seen. We spent a good 3 hours driving through the Badlands, taking pictures and having a good time before we decided to get back on route to Deadwood. 

Before leaving the park, I spotted a very cool overlook that I thought would be perfect for some pictures. My friend stopped the car and we all got out and took some more photos. 

I do have to mention it was very cold out this day. My friend and his girl started to head back to the car while I stood there looking out into the vast prairie, taking in all of the Badlands natural beauty one last time before we left. As I was heading back to the car, I spotted a cool looking rock and decided to take it with me. I can't explain it but I had an uncontrollable urge to take this rock. 

So, now I'm back in the car with the rock, and as we start to leave, I immediately start to feel uneasy and uncomfortable, something just wasn't right. I felt like I needed to put the rock back from where I got it. I contemplated telling my friend to turn around, but I didn't want to cause any trouble or make him think I'm crazy or something. I didn't know what to do and the feeling got worse.

I didn't feel sick, I just felt like I took something that belonged to someone or something and they were pissed off so this was their way of letting me know. 

This sounds crazy but there were two words cycling through my head the whole drive to Deadwood, and they were, ""You're cursed"". I started to envision dark/disturbing thoughts which made this whole situation even more uncomfortable. I won't get in to detail but these envisions were pure disgusting and involved my friends, but I just tried my best to shrug it off and act like everything was okay as I was battling tears. 

I know this sounds crazy and you might think I'm being dramatic, but this was reality for me. This feeling, these envisions, this level of discomfort is totally unlike me. My friends could also see that I was clearly bothered. They asked me what was wrong, but I just said ""nothing"" and kept quiet. This whole situation felt so disturbing and still bothers me to this day when I think about it. 

When we got to Deadwood, I started to feel better. I tried my hardest to forget about the rocks and what happened. I didn't know what I should do with the rocks so I just left them at the hotel we stayed at. 

As of now, I haven't gotten that uncomfortable feeling again nor have I felt or experienced any sort of effects from this. 

Did I dodge a bullet? Was taking that rock a mistake? Why did I have those disturbing thoughts and envisions? Am I overthinking all of this? 

So many questions with so little answers. Please let me know you're thoughts on my experience and comment any advice, questions, or theories about this. 

Thanks for reading!"
"Unexplained Message Via Facebook","Georgia","Family / Friends Visits","I hadn't planned to share this one, but Silverthane's great story about the candle blowing out at the church (Spirit Wind) motivated me. Of all of my ""experiences"" this one is the most weird and far out, I think, so I'll just give it my best shot.

I lost a lot of people during the 2012-2013 ""school year,"" including two of my bosses and my mom, whom I was VERY close to. It was a really busy time for me with my immediate family, however, and I had lots going on also in my career, so when I think of some of the things that happened, well, it's not like I dwelled on them. I just soldiered through... 

First my bosses died within just a few weeks of each other in the fall of 2012. One had been sick for quite some time and was somewhat expected. He was the publisher of our newspaper and quite well loved. The other was the editor, much younger, also a pillar of our community and died quite unexpectedly. I attended the publisher's funeral, but more on that in a moment. 

The following March, Mom passed away from cancer. She had not been to the doctor and had never mentioned she was feeling badly until the last few weeks. She'd been very active and led a full life until her last, I'd say, three weeks. I know, crazy. 

I've mentioned a few strange occurrences in previous posts and comments about Mom's passing, but this is the one that I have the toughest time wrapping my brain around. I am not a big Facebook person, don't even have an account anymore. I mostly used to just look in on my college kids' photos at the time of Mom's passing. 

A day or so after she died, I got a message from my college roommate's mom. I saved it at the time because it was so weird. I cut and pasted it into a document which I have saved for years. Here's the content: From my roommate's mom: ""___, I read your comment about your Mom and had no idea. I can't believe it! So very sorry."" 

Then, there was this strange message, inserted into her comment: ""While watching a little TV on Sunday, instead of going to church I watched a Church in Atlanta honoring one of its senior pastors who had been retired many years. He was 92 at that time and I wondered why the Church even bothered to ask the old gentleman to preach at that age. After a warm welcome, introduction of this speaker, and as the applause quieted down he rose from his high back chair and walked slowly, with great effort and a sliding gate to the podium. Without a note or written paper of any kind he placed both hands on the pulpit to steady himself and then quietly and slowly he began to speak... 

""When I was asked to come here today and talk to you, your pastor asked me to tell you what was the greatest lesson ever learned in my 50 odd years of preaching. I thought about it for a few days and boiled it down to just one thing that made the most difference in my life and sustained me through all my trials. The one thing that I could always rely on when tears and heart break and pain and fear and sorrow paralyzed me... The only thing that would comfort was this verse... 

""Jesus loves me this I know. 

For the Bible tells me so. 

Little ones to Him belong, 

We are weak but He is strong... 

Yes, Jesus loves me... 

The Bible tells me so."" 

When he finished, the church was quiet. You actually could hear his footsteps as he shuffled back to his chair. I don't believe I will ever forget it. A pastor once stated, ""I always noticed that it was the adults who chose the children's hymn 'Jesus Loves Me' (for the children of course) during a hymn sing, and it was the adults who sang the loudest because I could see they knew it the best."" 

""Senior version of Jesus Loves Me"" 

Here is a new version just for us who have white hair or no hair at all. For us over middle age (or even those almost there) and all you others, check out this newest version of Jesus Loves Me. 

JESUS LOVES ME 

Jesus loves me, this I know, 

Though my hair is white as snow 

Though my sight is growing dim, 

Still He bids me trust in Him. 

 (CHORUS) 

YES, JESUS LOVES ME... YES, JESUS LOVES ME... 

YES, JESUS LOVES ME FOR THE BIBLE TELLS ME SO. 

Though my steps are oh, so slow, 

With my hand in His I'll go 

On through life, let come what may, 

He'll be there to lead the way. 

 (CHORUS) 

When the nights are dark and long, 

In my heart He puts a song. 

Telling me in words so clear, 

""Have no fear, for I am near."" 

 (CHORUS) 

When my work on earth is done, 

And life's victories have been won. 

He will take me home above, 

Then I'll understand His love 

 (CHORUS) 

I love Jesus, does He know? 

Have I ever told Him so? 

Jesus loves to hear me say, 

That I love Him every day. 

 (CHORUS) 

God Bless Us All! 

Every day is a gift... That's why it's called the Present"" 

From Mrs. Ramsay again (trying to make this clear): That entire, lengthy message, was inserted into my friend's Facebook message. After, she continues her message below:

""Can't believe it! So very sorry. 

Like · [Comment] ·Unfollow PostFollow Post""

A day or so later, after Mom's funeral, she wrote: ""I have no idea how this preacher story got in my message to you!"" 

I replied: ""Really? You didn't write that story? Help me now with this. If you didn't write it, how did it get in there?""

She replied: ""I have no idea where that came from. Wish I was so talented! Kinda scary something like that can just pop up out of the blue. I guess it could have been worse. Maybe it's message was good considering the circumstances. Hope you are doing ok. Thinking about you.

16 hours ago via mobile · Like""

Then I replied: ""I'm calling it as some kind of spiritual thing that's unexplained. I really don't think prayers pop up because of spammers, and the strangest thing is that the description of the minister at the beginning absolutely describes the guy who did mom's service. Except it popped up in your message two days before the service. Other good things occurred the night she passed, and I'm holding onto them as well, even though some people don't like to think of things, it's just uncomfortable and unexplainable. All good though. And sort of cool. Thanks for... ""

So YG'ers, I cut and pasted the above for your perusal. But before I finish, one more quick thing. After a couple weeks, I went back and read the strange, inserted message again. It wasn't ONLY that the message described the old pastor who did Mom's funeral, it was the whole thing about the song.

You see, I realized that the last time I had been in a church was at my boss's funeral. And the commentary in the message about ""Jesus Loves Me"" relates to the THOUGHTS I had at that time! It was during the singing of the hymns, and I kept messing up because I wasn't familiar with them, and I had wished to myself that it was ""Jesus Loves Me"" (because I had just re-learned it after many years to teach it to my little ones). 

So, I have spam in a Facebook message, unaccountable in the midst of a comment from someone who said she did not write it. It talked about future events (the old pastor) and it talked about my THOUGHTS at the last time I was in church. 

Did I get a spiritual message at the time of my mom's death? I think so! (and this was just one of a few). I'd LOVE to hear what you guys think. Hope I did not make it too complicated..."
"Haunted Tunnels","Colorado","Haunted Places","If you have ever been to or lived in Colorado Springs you've probably heard the story about the haunted Gold Camp Road tunnels, there are a total of three tunnels up there. 

Summed up, the story says that several years back an elementary school bus carrying kids for a field trip was going through the third tunnel when the tunnel collapsed, killing everyone on the bus. There is no information on this actually happening, only that there is still metal from something trapped in the tunnel that is now closed off from the public. It is unknown if this actually happened or if it was just a hoax that got out of hand. 

The myth is that if you drive to the second tunnel, turn off your lights and put your car in neutral and wait a minute, you will see a dark figure at one of the entrances to the tunnel and you will start to feel your car get pushed out of the tunnel up the hill, depending on which way you come from and when you get home later you will see tiny hand prints in the dirt of your car.

I have always believed that we were never alone on this earth but always believed that we were among angels and demons and I did not believe that people could come back as ghosts or anything like that. However, I have had one experience at this tunnel and my sister had another, as well as others at my apartment, that has started to changed my mind about ghosts.

The first incidence happened 4 years ago when I had moved out here. I went up Gold Camp with a guy I was seeing and he had taken me to the tunnel and stopped in the middle and shut his lights off. At first, I didn't know what he was doing because I didn't know about this story at the time. After about five to ten minutes it got really cold and I thought I saw an animal run by the entrance, then the car started rolling, we were facing downhill so I just assumed we were rolling from gravity. After we left he told me about the story, there were no hand prints or anything so I just brushed it off and assumed he was messing with me. 

Fast forward two years, my sister had moved out here a year after I did and I never thought to tell her about the tunnel story because I didn't believe it was true at the time. I was working night shift at my job one night and I guess my sister, who was staying with me at the time, had gone out to the mountains with her friends. 

My sister had an upgraded Chevy Tahoe at the time which was pretty tall with aftermarket tires and such. The next morning when I came home and was walking in, I noticed she had tiny little handprints on her back hatch above the window and it also looked like someone had rubbed their hands along the sides of the Tahoe. 

I went inside and asked her about the baby handprints and she started freaking out and ran outside. When she came back she told me about how they went up there and her friend told her the story so they tried it. They were going uphill when her Tahoe started rolling but didn't really think much into it until she seen the handprints.

Thankfully these were very minimal experiences compared to a few other stories I've heard. I'm still weird about going up there after dark because I later found out that these tunnels are actually huge witchcraft grounds. There have been sacrifices, murders, rapes and a lot of dark stuff happen here. Almost everyone who has been up these tunnels have witnessed something strange or felt dark energy in or around these tunnels. 

If anyone has been here or experienced something I would love to hear your stories."
"Rattles & Drums","California","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","At the end of October 2018 I began having some bizarre experiences at night. As I lay in bed my feet would get grabbed, shaken or slapped. I would also be touched on other areas of my body including being shaken by the shoulder and groped sexually. This activity occurred for about two weeks and then stopped. I then purchased a digital camcorder with infra-red night vision to film the foot of my bed at night to see if I could capture anything unusual.

It was the end of November when I acquired the camera and promptly started recording at night. When I first started to review the footage I noticed what looked like orbs that would glide around from time to time. Although I found these interesting, I'm not really sure what these are since they could possibly be flying insects or dust flurries, or they could be spirit orbs, I just can't say for sure.

What caught the attention of my husband and I was these strange sounds that showed up on the audio. The first three quarters of the recording was accompanied with the sound of a rattle. This rattle sound would seem to follow a particular pattern and stop for a few seconds and then start again. After about three quarters of the way through this initial 30 minute recording, a banging sound became audible.

This banging sound seemed to follow the same pattern as the rattle, playing for a few seconds and then pausing for a few seconds and repeating. To my husband and I, it sounds like Native American drumming and rattles. 

Now, I've been having out of body travels now for most of my adult life and once as a child, and in my more recent travels, I've come to notice certain familiar people that I would often come across or even see in my room.

One of these familiar people is what appears to be an old Native American man. When my husband heard the recording for the first time, he said that it sounded Native American so I began researching local Native American history. I learned that the Native Americans in this region are referred to as the Kumeyaay, and as I was browsing their website I came across a photo of an old man, and I instantly recognised him as the man that I've seen in my room and other locations. His name is Cinon Duro Mataweer and he died in 1910. He was a tribal leader, medicine man and tribal shaman. 

I've been recording in my bedroom at night and in other parts of the house and the rattles and drums show up in every recording. They also vary. There was a time when the pattern or melody changed, when the recordings are short, about 10 minutes or so, the drumming sound still starts about three quarters of the way in.

There were some times when the drumming was already in progress. There have been other sounds as well. Sometimes you can hear the sound of some kind of whooshing sound, like a rock in a sling or something cutting the air. There has also been the sound of some kind of flute. Also embedded within all this you can hear what sounds like whispering. Sometimes you can almost make out a few words that sound like English; however, most of the time it is indiscernible. 

I will try and share some of these recordings on this website if possible. I've asked the webmaster how to go about doing that. I believe I have something very significant here."
"The Mountain","Arizona","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","This story might not be very frightening but it made a great impression upon me. 

I have lived most of my life in the State of Georgia but from 1993 to 1996 I lived with my father and my stepmother in Litchfield Park, Arizona. 

It may be worth noting that the reason for this was that there was a domestic abuse situation in the home of my mother in Georgia. The ""Powers That Be"" contacted my father. My sister and I were hastily placed on a flight with very few belongings.

My grades in school were always very good up until then for the simple fact that studying and doing homework was the best way for me to ""shut out"" all of the chaos around me.

When I started high school in Arizona, my math grades started to slip in a big way. I had a lot on my mind. I had very serious questions going on in my mind about the life that I left behind in Georgia.

Shortly after arriving in Arizona, I made a lasting judgment of my father. The impression that he gives off is of a highly intelligent and highly creative person. Creative in an artistic way and creative in abstract thought. At the time, he worked as an instructor within Palo Verde Generating Station. A Nuclear Power Plant. He is retired now.

Unfortunately, I also quickly found him to be very emotional and prone to snap decisions. In other words, he says many things that he comes to regret later. I probably don't need to say that, even now, we have a relationship that is under strain. We have a great history of misunderstandings that we share together.

One of the things he said to me that he later came to regret was: ""If you get another bad grade in math, you'll be sorry!""

From the hellish environment that I knew of in Georgia, ""sorry"" could have meant any number of terrible things. As it turned out, his threat made my concentration even worse and my report card reflected that. I was too afraid to get on the school bus home.

At the time that I was living there, the students of Litchfield Park from the 10th grade and up had to go to ""Agua Fria Union High School"" in Avondale. I was too afraid to be available for a confrontation with my father at home. It wasn't likely that he would forget to ask me for my report card.

My best plan of action was to ""mill around"" in the vicinity of the high school until dark and then head home. I reasoned that he would be worried about me and that it would outweigh being angry about my math grade. It was a terrible and selfish idea. It wasn't my finest moment.

I wandered around and found myself in a desolate looking area well before sunset. It was far away from the road and behind some buildings but it was roughly in the direction I judged to be towards my house, which might have been six miles away.

In this area, about fifty feet away from the nearest structure, I came upon a mountain of shoes. There were hundreds of them. As I looked at them, I could clearly see that there were matches to be found amongst them.

I went closer to the mountain of shoes with the intention of walking the perimeter but a loud and authoritative male voice shouted: ""STOP"".

I jumped back. There was no one around. The sun was still high enough in the sky that I knew no one was around. I knew that the voice had come from either the mountain of shoes or from very close to my face because I felt the sound waves from the word. As soon as I jumped back, the top of the pile tumbled down a bit, though I had never touched it.

I ran from the area. When I ran between two buildings, I was in such a hurry that I ran through and obliterated an old, dried up wooden fence and fell on the street behind it.

I was seen by a police patrol car while I was on the street and they brought me home. I told them that I missed the bus. These were the days before everyone on Earth had a cell phone and it was a plausible story that I said nobody answered when I called.

When I got home I explained to my dad about being afraid to show him my report card. When I told him what had happened with the shoes he said: ""It was your self conscious. You should know your old dad only wants the best for you.""

How the heck should I have known that I wasn't going to face some kind of abuse in Arizona too? By that time my experiences had made my faith in adults abysmal, at best. 

I still got a punishment for the grade. I had to go in the back yard and pick up, what seemed like, a hundred rotten lemons off of the ground from under his lemon trees, replete with fruit flies.

He didn't remember to punish me for my lack of faith.

My math grades improved after I was finally able to talk to my mom again. I was and still am a great reader of all kinds of books. Right now I'm reading ""Titus Alone"" by Mervyn Peake.

Thank you for reading my story."
"The Lady In A White Robe","North Carolina","Haunted Places","Look, to be entirely honest I still have no idea why or what it was so let's start. This is also relatively short. 

I have a bad past. My old stepfather was an alcoholic and mental abuser. Please don't pity me, but it relates a bit to the story. 

When I was five or six we lived with my scary stepdad Jeff and my bathroom was right across from my bedroom with about 5 or 6 foot hallway in the middle. It was a straight shot and with both doors open, from my bed I could see in the bathroom. 

One day I went to the bathroom early afternoon while my mom, in a robe, went downstairs to make coffee. My mom is blonde, which is important. So I finish and I come out of the bathroom but I get a bad feeling so I stop short in the hallway, looking straight into my room. 

Out of my peripherals I see a blonde-haired woman in a white robe standing by the banister to the stairs, staring at me. Now I'm thinking that can't be mom she's downstairs so I'm freaking out so I did a stupid thing but remember I'm 5-6. I called out, ""Mom, Mom is that you, Mom?"" It doesn't move, it doesn't look like it has a face but I'm scared, so scared. 

So not knowing what to do I run into my room, wait a minute and go back out to hear mom asking me why I slammed the door from the bottom of the stairs, in a black robe. 

After that I always heard walking and scratching in my room walls and attic cause, of course I had the attic room. I also one time heard my name being whispered when no one was there. 

I'm no longer in that house but it still baffles and scares me today. I think because of it I've always been sensitive to the supernatural. I now can read energies and feel spirits and other things I wish to not say. I also always thought that it was my stepdad's fault all the paranormal stuff happened in that house, maybe his bad energies attracted bad stuff I don't know but that house had and has bad juju. I feel bad for whoever has moved into there."
"Merry Christmas From The Other Side","Oregon","Family / Friends Visits","Years ago at Christmas time I got a big tin full of popcorn from my mom, the last Christmas we had together. The metal tin is almost a foot tall with an angel on it. After eating all the popcorn, I filled it up with old pictures I had laying around. There were all kinds of photos of cousins, camping trips and more. 

Months will go by and I'll open the tin for a certain picture I know is there. I love my pictures and will spend hours going through them. I've planned to put them all in an album one day. Once in a while I'd open it and notice it's only half full? Later on there would only be two or there pictures at the bottom of the tin! I didn't know what to think about it, or understand why this would occur.

There was another Christmas coming, and I pulled out the old popcorn tin that I had filled with pictures my mom gave me before she passed away. I started to at last put them in picture albums. I pretty much knew what was in there now. It wasn't as packed so full of photos, I put them a side for later.

I was up watching TV late one night. My mind drifted away to all the holidays gone by. I thought of all my family and friends I love that are on the other side now. Looking at my old pictures brought back memories and I missed them so much. I told them all hello and Merry Christmas, then I drifted off to sleep.

The day before Christmas when I opened the popcorn tin to get a special picture out, right on top were pictures of all the very people I had said ""hello, and Merry Christmas"" to?! There were even a few extra of my brother who has passed I don't remember having at all? Our family had very few pictures of my brother, and there he was in a picture with his favorite dog! 

I was happy and totally baffled. I was just so surprised at the order these certain pictures of family and friends were in, they were in the order as I was remembering them a few nights before. I sat there in silence looking at their pictures when I suddenly realized, they were saying ""hello"" and ""Merry Christmas"" to me too from the other side. 🎁"
"Shadowy Greetings From My Haunted Childhood","Florida","Haunted Places","When I was very young, around 5 years of age, my parents moved out to the rural town of Wimauma, Florida. I had numerous encounters there of a seemingly paranormal nature. 

We moved into a 2 bedroom single wide trailer with no air conditioning so leaving the windows and bedroom doors open for simple cross ventilation was a necessity. Include the use of fans to help move the air and then just deal with the temperature as best as you can. 

On the very first night we moved in, things began for me. I don't remember sleeping through the night. My parents explained things away as my nerves about moving there. Strange noises in my room and shadows... Lots of shadows. 

The trailer was set far, far back from the old country road. The property had one outside light my father called a ""Silent Giant"" light that sat high atop a telephone pole that cast a goodly amount of light around the area with the road a great distance the other side of the light. This being said... Even if there was a car driving down the road we were too far away to be affected by its headlights unless it was directly driving up the extremely long driveway towards the trailer and, even then, its lights would have been diffused by the Silent Giant street light outside. 

Now, I can understand skepticism about the strange noises... We had just moved from a suburb type area into a rural area in the middle of an old school fish farm with seemingly countless pools of fish and the numerous forms of nature and animals that came along with it such as frogs, toads, alligators and even the occasional raccoons and stray cats and dogs. But the shadows just can't be explained away so easily, especially when they had shapes and forms that couldn't be seen through. 

Like I said earlier, I don't remember sleeping through that first night. At some point early on the noises woke me. I remember looking out my bedroom window and thinking I heard something outside. When I got back into bed and tried to go back to sleep, I began seeing strange figures standing in my doorway looking at me. 

Eventually they moved on and a seemingly endless parade of shadow ""creatures"" began walking past my doorway pausing long enough to look directly at me and then move on. One by one they filed past my room like a bunch of school children walking past an exhibit on a field trip to a museum or an animal at a zoo. 

It only happened that particular way that very first night. There were other times similar in the weeks to come and then it died down. 

Many other times during my time there, I repeatedly saw a shadowy figure of humanoid outline that couldn't be seen through and all you could see of it were two eyes that seemed to stare through me. 

Once I ventured down the hallway to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night only to be blocked by something shapeless and dark in color. With my heart pounding out of my chest I immediately ran back to my bed and hid under my covers. 

Although not ""shadow"" related there were numerous times the television turned on by itself either in the middle of the night or when no one was home. 

We lived there for just over 6 years before a fire burned through the area, taking our trailer with it and we had to move to Tampa."
"Shadow People?","New York","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","Before I begin I want to elaborate a bit on myself so you may see my story objectively and not stigmatize my previous experiences that led me there. 

In 2016, when I was 16 years of age, I had been hospitalized for overworking myself in school. I was part of the AP U.S. History class in which we were competing with other specialized high schools in New York City. I was also treasurer of the National Honor Society, I was on Yearbook Committee, the head of a student organized monthly talent show, and I was secretary of student government. 

I was merely a junior in high school trying to apply into a college that would assist me in pursuing the premed track. Therefore, I was pushing myself beyond my own limitations to which I got very depressed and burnt out. 

I was hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital (which is not an ""asylum""). Ultimately you get to go to a school in the hospital, then group therapy, meet with doctors, pet therapy, talk with peers your age and then leave back to your normal life or partial program where you do the same thing except you get to go back home at the end of the day. 

When I was discharged from the psychiatric hospital after two weeks, they sent me to a partial hospitalization program. I have had a history of major depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. The symptoms were usually just getting very anxious and crying, but keep in mind I had always been very level headed throughout my life.

I told the doctors there that I couldn't stop having nightmares and had too much anxiety to sleep. They prescribed me a few sleeping medications but they didn't really work. Then they tried a medication called Ambien. 

If you look at the side-effects, hallucinations is a very big one. I remember seeing my parents being zoomed in and then extremely far away within seconds.

My mother was with me, as well as my grandfather, trying to get me to drink water to hopefully flush the medication out of my system. 

We had the lights on and the TV as well at the time but then I saw figures I'll never be able to forget. They weren't scary but very strange. 

They were shadow people or shadow children? They were somewhere in between if I remember correctly. They had blue and yellow glowing eyes. One was waving to me and the other was trying to hand me what I believed to be books, but I could be wrong. There were two in particular from what I could remember, just sitting on top of my furniture almost touching the ceiling. They seemed more friendly than ""evil"". They were also two-dimensional beings.

Their eyes were the size of baseballs and they had small heads, or maybe it was the size of their eyes that made their heads look small. I was not scared at all. But when I told other people about it they seemed as if they would be frightened. 

I looked into it later to then find that the term ""shadow people"" I thought I had coined for them was already put into existence. There were websites, forums, etc just talking about the shadow people and who they are. 

From what I felt, even though I was hallucinating because of the drug, I don't feel they are evil beings. I am not sure whether they are spirits or of another dimension. 

Please let me know what you think. Thank you for reading!"
"The Fire Department On Highway 2","Montana","Haunted Places","I served as a volunteer firefighter at the Smith Valley Volunteer Fire Department in Kalispell, Montana for about 3 years before I moved to Washington and I have had many encounters there-as well as other fire fighters although most of the staff who previously worked there thinks of the afterlife as ""nonsense"" due to, and understandingly, dealing with death regularly and dismissed mine and a couple others stories, what I myself have experienced and have no other explanation for. 

I believe the building was built in 2006 and it's right off of highway 2. As far as I know it was not built on any Indian burial grounds or anything like that. Many people have come and gone there since it is a very mentally and physically challenging job. You don't ever think of anything being ""paranormal"" unless you are alone in the station itself.

#1

The first encounter I had was when I had a scheduled shift there and I had baked a frozen pizza in the upstairs kitchen and was headed to one of the recliners when I heard footsteps on the roof walking in the same path I was walking and when I stopped, so did it. I thought maybe it was my mind playing tricks on me so I sat down on the chair and turned on the TV and the footsteps on the roof started to pace back and forth above me, so I got up and walked over toward the door and stood there listening and the footsteps walked over toward me and started pacing back and forth above me again so that was when I first ""NOPED"" right out of the living room, down the stairs, and spent the rest of the day in the computer room in the fire engine bay.

#2 It was a week before we were hosting a rummage sale at the fire station and me and my best friend had brought a washer/dryer set as well as other miscellaneous things for the sale into the back of the bay area when we both heard the loud murmuring of what sounded like some men arguing but when we started walking towards the stairway of a storage area to where the sound was coming from you could hear ""shh shhh"" like who ever was up there didn't want us to hear them and then silence. I went up the stairs to investigate the sounds and once again I was the only one in the area. Creeped out, I finished unloading the rest of the stuff and we hopped into my pickup truck and took off after locking up. Even my friend who didn't at the time believe in anything ""paranormal"" had no explanation for that.

#3 I had been telling my roommate ""Daniel"" name changed for privacy, about the happenings at the fire station and he wanted to go there and experience it too, so feeling brave I said ""screw it, let's go see if we could get anything to happen"". Not much did happen as were walking around the whole building until we got into the kitchen area downstairs (there are 2 kitchen areas one for the ""community area"" and another for the ""living quarters"" and we were downstairs in the community area) when we heard stuff moving around and a coughing sound come from a locked storage closet and of course when I unlocked the closet to see what was in there, there was only cleaning supplies and a mop and bucket. Neither of us liked that so he headed to my car to start it up and get warm since it was winter time and I took a couple extra minutes to lock up the building and turn all of the lights off before we left. As I got into my car and started to back out of the parking space in front of the kitchen area we both saw the lights in the kitchen turn back on when I KNEW nobody else but me and him were there so I tore out of the parking lot and didn't go back in until a emergency call a couple days later.

#4 after the many things I have had happen here, most small stuff like locked doors opening up, doors that were supposed to be shut opening up on the fire trucks, the above stories, etc I refused to stay the night there again, but I brought my at the time girlfriend ""Karen"" down to the station one evening to give her a tour. A few minutes into walking into the station one of the extension cords hanging from the ceiling plugged into a truck to keep the trucks batteries charged up ""popped"" out of the socket echoing in the bay and started swinging back and forth as if somebody had just yanked it out and you needed to yank with some force to get those to come out. She yelped and ran over to me and I said ""alright time to leave"" so we started walking toward the door when we heard shuffling coming up behind us really fast, so we bolted out the door, locked it, and took off. 

Of course I had one more shift to spend there which goes into my next story.

#5 I had brought a buddie from a different fire department onto my department and since he was now ""probationary"" he had mandatory shifts to work there and I decided to also work a shift with him one night, this night being the final straw of me staying overnight there again. ""Ronald"" and everybody else thought that what I explained to them was ""nonsense"" and that ghosts don't exist, well this night changed his perspective of this. I was hanging out in the computer room and he was upstairs in the living room when he came downstairs and quietly sat in a chair across from me with a really puzzled look on his face. He said ""I don't understand, I keep hearing what sounds like boots coming up the stairs and a shadow of somebody standing at the door but when I open it up, there's nobody there"" me not wanting to get more freaked out than I already was, I just changed the subject and we talked about other things to kill some time.

 Well it was getting late and I was tired so I decided to go upstairs and get ready for bed and ""Ronald"" was going to watch tv and probably fall asleep on the couch in the living room on the other side of the bedroom I was sleeping in. I was in bed going on my phone when the door opened up a little bit and a shadow of somebody came quietly walking in and walked over toward the window and stood there with his hands behind his back looking out the window. Seeing the TV on through the half open door I said ""Ronald, what are you doing? Dude you're being a creep come on man"" no answer. Annoyed I got up out of bed while still staring at the shadow when I turned on the light and the shadow of a man was no longer there. Vanished as soon as I turned on the light. I quickly peaked my head out the door and ""Ronald"" was fast asleep. I spent the rest of my night on the other couch with all of the lights upstairs turned on. I asked him a couple of weeks later if he had any other weird things happen there and he said one night he was getting ready for bed and happened to look outside the window before closing the blinds and he saw 2 men dressed in suits standing in the parking lot standing side by side looking up at him. He went downstairs quickly to confront the men and found nobody outside. Checked the security camera the next day and not a single person was recorded walking through the parking lot.

To my knowledge nobody has died in the building but we have had a couple firefighters pass on previously and their firefighter helmets are hung high up on the wall in honor of them. 

There are also a few crosses on both sides of the highway in front of the building so this could also contribute to the ""activity""."
"Misty Black Hand","Texas","A Haunted Life","This is my second posting; I didn't get much feedback on my last post so I'm hoping this time will be different. Or someone knows what this is. 

I'm not entirely sure what this is, but it's been happening to me for years and it's the same thing over and over again. At night when I'm laying down to sleep, an eerie feeling will creep over me, my heart rate will increase, I'm petrified, and it is like I know something is there, staring at me and when I pick up my hand to move (because it's always the first thing I think to do for some reason). My hand is black, with long black fingers, and it is almost a mist. I'm usually so petrified by seeing this I blink to make it go away. 

It usually does, and the eerie feeling with it. I'm so scared to let whatever it is continue that I always blink and will it away, I never let it continue.

I have had many sightings of a black figure, particularly in my great grandmother's old house, in which the game room was full of activity. I was always so scared to go into the game room by myself as a little girl. At night the door would open by itself and this malevolent feeling would crash over me, I could never escape this fear. And when I see this hand, it is the same exact feeling. I never know when it's going to happen until I feel the eerie feeling wash over me. 

I don't have any activity going on in my apartment, nothing out of the ordinary. But I have had many dreams relating to this, I feel like it is trying to creep in. I hope I am not just crazy.: ("
"Confused And Bruised 10/30/2019","Ohio","Succubus / Incubus / Sexual Ghosts","I am in my mid 40s and until now never gave much thought to paranormal experiences. And I certainly never experienced any. I moved into my house April 2019 and the evening of Wednesday October 30, 2019 I laid in bed watching tv, after a couple hours I turned off my television & I tried to fall asleep. Somewhere between 10:00 pm and 11:00 pm I drifted off only to be awaken by what felt like someone was tucking my comforter under my body. Upon waking up the sensation lessened, and I thought it must have been a dream. While trying to fall back to sleep I felt something moving up my legs, traveling across my back to the back of my neck. At that point I threw the blankets back turned over and jumped quickly out of my bed. Nothing was there, no mouse, no evidence a mouse had been in my bed. Just me freaked out and now wide awake. I thought to myself, maybe too much coffee or maybe it was the Halloween candy. So, I attempted to sleep for the rest of the evening. 

The next night was Halloween, once again I laid in bed turned on my television watched for roughly and hour or so, then turned TV off. I rolled onto my stomach to fall asleep. Within minutes I felt something once again traveling up my legs under the blankets, it felt as if a mouse or small animal was running over my legs. I kicked my legs up to scare off the mouse, only to feel it yet again as soon as I settled back in under the blankets. Still thinking it could only be a mouse I was now very irritated. Then I thought am I really feeling something or am I imagining it? Either way I was irritated and exhausted from two nights of little sleep. I thought if it's mice there's no way I can live with them in my house. So, I bought mouse traps. Still thinking I had mice in my house. 

Now its day four, no sign of mice or any other animals for that matter. Glue traps untouched. 

Each night however, was the same thing, watch Tv with no interruptions, then once I shut off television and roll over on my stomach to sleep. THERE IT IS! Except now, it felt like someone was wrapping my legs up to my thighs in cellophane, tightly wrapping my legs together. Start at my feet and work it's way up my body tucking the blankets under my body. 

 It felt like the blankets were vacuum sealed under my legs and up my body. I laid or tried to lay as lightly as possible while my heart was pounding in my chest. Not wanting to admit what was happening or maybe not wanting to upset it. But to feel the sensation start at my feet, travel up my legs, my thighs, across my back up to my shoulder and feel it touching my hair or cheek... At that point I threw the covers off my body and jumped up out of bed. Heart racing, but not afraid exactly, but definitely, concerned. 

My first thought now was to tell it ""This house is a home of Love and Faith for Jesus Christ! You are not welcome here, you must honor The Lord, I need you to leave!"" It worked, WOW it worked. 

Clearly someone was visiting me, I thought I sensed a female because she was gentle nonthreatening, and almost concerned I needed to be secure and comfortable in my bed, but she is gone now. Well for one night, the following day she was back. She started at my legs and worked her way up my body, I really tried to ignore her, but she just wouldn't stop. Up and down my body and at the point she would touch my hair I would yell ""go away! My home serves the Lord!"" or ""leave this house you don't live here anymore.!"" I told her she was dead and needed to rest now and stop touching dozens of times. She nudged and continued tucking my comforter under my body. What ever fear I may have had was replaced with exhaustion and aggregation. Just wanted her to leave, after 8 days of this night after night I decided I had to act. 

I spoke over the phone with a lady (Renee) who has a local group that go to homes, businesses or anywhere there is unexplained experiences such as ghost, angel, demons ect...

I walked into my bedroom, as this is the only place it would make its presence known. Very quiet, no sense of her anywhere... Well until I began telling Renee how this ""Thang"" would touch me and prevent me from sleeping. It became irritated, nudging me with some pressure, more than before, the sensation of moving from my feet up my body had become up and down both legs, then a tight wrapping feeling on my legs again. Renee and I then changed the topics, we talked about our families. Within minutes It completely stopped touching I couldn't hear or feel her. Until Renee asked more questions about her and wanted to plan a visit. Immediately It was irritated by this conversation. This night I admit I was scared.

I didn't want to stay home, so had dinner with a friend at a restaurant that just opened. We sat at the bar and the bartender out of the blue began to tell the history of the building and why people think they never stay open long. The building had been haunted for over a hundred years and the Ghost would throw dishes, trip servers and even shut down the power source to the building. I couldn't believe after my week that of all the topics we could have covered he wanted to share a ghost story. That night I made my friend stay with thinking I would be able sleep better if I had company, that It would surely not bother me. It barely touched me. And my friend never felt a thing. I thought Praise God I could sleep tonight! 

Then the next two nights were horrible, It would not allow me to fall asleep. Room felt very occupied. This night I felt more than just her. There was definitely stronger, bigger or maybe a different kind of presence in my bedroom and I felt them intimidated. Forget sleeping, one was at top of my bed moving my hair around touching my neck and face. I had my body covered from head to toe with all my blankets but could still feel them. The new IT, felt like ""Male It"" firmly felt his way from legs up my body, I felt pressure on both breasts and my abdomen. My arms felt as if I was unable to move them. I kicked my legs up pulling blankets up and it felt like they were off the bed. Immediately grabbed my blankets and wrapped myself as tightly as I could. The Male was on top of me I felt the weight of him and again couldn't move either of my arms. I felt it move up my legs and it physically moved my thighs apart. I began to scream NO! STOP! NO PLEASE NO! I don't want this! I tried to kick my legs up but it was like a dream where you are in slow motion. I felt him squeezing my breasts and pushing hard on my stomach, and touching me across my panties again me screaming NO NO NO! PLEASE STOP IT! I thought I was kicking my legs but he was clearly still able to touch my panty area. Then it felt like I was pinched on my arm. I was able to move both arms at that point. In a split second everything stopped. But I couldn't get up I felt completely wiped out. Like all the energy was sucked out of my body. Oddly enough I fell asleep. I woke up in the morning covered head to toe to the pillow I had over my face pulled off hard, I got made the bed, undressed get into the shower. I had a hand print across my face a four bruises on my arm. It was then I felt nauseous, like I had been used to please this Thing that has come into my home. 

 The next few nights, Female It will still come in, touch my legs then start tucking me in. Then I feel the Male It climb on top on me he goes right for panties, I feel pressure on my stomach. I yell at him to get off me, No! Get off I don't want you touching me! He backs off but will try again when he thinks I'm asleep. I had pjs, 5 blankets and pillows all around me but it doesn't matter. I finally left my bedroom two nights ago to sleep on my sofa. Laid down peace at last... She came out and began to tuck me in. I pleaded with her to please just let me sleep tonight. I asked her what I can do to help her rest, asked who she is, who he is... But no communication at all. Only touching, they have been in my home for two weeks now, lights flickers, touching me, bruising me, slapped me, keep me awake, and I feel they won't leave on their own and he could hurt me. 

Last night I slept with Tv & lights on, also a wrap around massager on my neck hoping the distractions would keep them out of my bed. It seemed to work for a while. Any advice? I feel like I am crazy talking but this is beyond exhausting and very real. 

This Friday I have a Monsignor from my church coming to cleanse my home and Bless it. I pray this is the answer they need to move on."
"Spitting Ghost?","Washington","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","My name is Sarah. I'm 40 years old, it was about 7:45 am when this happened. I'm sitting in the bedroom alone messaging my friends on Facebook, my other half is at work, my older son took off for school, so it's just me and my 2 year old at home. He's asleep and is still asleep as I write this. Anyways I'm sitting in my room and the tv is on but no noise; it's quiet can just hear the heater going in the room.

 No noise at all I'm messaging on fb and all of a sudden I feel something wet on my arm? So I look down and see like spit or drool coming down my arm. In my head I'm like WTF? So I look up at the ceiling maybe it's leaking? Nothing, no water bottles or no one around me. I was in shock like where the F did this come from? My phone is already in my hand so I take a picture of it cause it's sliding down my arm to my pants? No odor to it? Just tripped out? 

 I goggled being spit by a ghost and it brought me here and it's freaky others share this story. Has this happened to any one else recently? Freaked out - where did the spit or saliva come from? 

 I'm Catholic and believe in ghosts and spirits and I often also have demon nightmares, sometimes really strong were I wake up crying and sometimes it just goes away. But for a random thing; ghost, spit demon, or whatever it was. I feel like I sound crazy, ummm hey a ghost spit on my arm. I'm awake I'm aware. I'm not high or drunk. This really happened! Who can help me? Why did something spit on my arm? Freaked out. Has anyone experienced this?

 I lit a candle afterwards and said a prayer. Please help."
"Just In Time","Mississippi","Haunted Places","In 2001 my mother moved to Atlanta, Georgia for 4 months for her job. I lived with her but I stayed home instead of going with her. I believe it was in April of that year. I had gone out with my best friend clubbing, something we always did on the weekend when I was in my twenties. We had a great time out that night and when the club let out I drove him home then I went home right afterwards and got on my bed and went to sleep. I will never forget this as long as I live. I was sleeping good but all of a sudden I woke up standing in the middle of my bedroom! 

 I do not sleep walk or wake up and jump out of bed for a few minutes but as I was standing in the middle of my room I looked at the clock and it was 5:34 am. As I turned to look at my bed all of a sudden my bed was on fire at the top where I was sleeping. I was able to grab my comforter and although the flames where rising I was able to put the fire out easily. I was so sleepy that I just went to sleep on the couch.

 I woke up around nine in the morning thinking that was one crazy vivid dream I had. First thing I noticed was that I had my window up although it was in the low 50's or upper 40's outside. When I walked into my room I saw that my comforter had a big hole in it! I didn't freak out but there was no way possible to know that my bed was about to go up in flames. As I was thinking that somehow I dodged a bullet I vaguely remember that I felt a force yank me out the bed and that is the absolute truth! I also remember that the smoke alarm went off at the same time it occurred but when I checked it there were no batteries in it so it was impossible for it to go off like it did. To this day I wondered if this was a loved one or an guardian angel that yanked me out the bed just in time. When I checked to see what could have caused that to happen I saw that my extension receptacle had shorted because I had my bed pressed up against it exposing the wires in the extension cord. That morning will stay with me forever."
"Hospital Weird Experiences","Texas","Haunted Places","As you all know from my previous stories that I work as a Nurse on a night shift schedule. This story is not really particularly scary but definitely of the weirdest I've experienced.

I work on this unit where it is just one hallway of rooms with a 20 bed capacity. Room 20th is at the very end of the hallway where the stairway to exit is located, other than that it is a dead end. At night that side is particularly more spooky than the rest of the unit. I've heard from my colleagues about some scary stuff they experienced at that side of the hallway especially in room 20. The stories ranged from patients saying they hear voices of children playing to people talking in the middle of the night where almost all are quiet and the staff are on the nurses station charting or doing something else. The unit does not have children at all, most our patients are adults and never children because we have a pediatric unit for that. So when patients say they hear children playing in the room, that kind of raises a red flag for us. These patients are alert and oriented and not confused just to clarify that. In regards to people talking, we dismissed that as probably just us staff talking.

This particular experience by an aide of ours is somewhat a little bit terrifying as this aide relay what happened to me when we were talking about paranormal stuff in the hospital.

Apparently one night he went to help out the patient in room 20. I believe it was something about toileting or something else, anyway after finishing helping the patient and making her settled in the bed, the patient thanked the aide and asked him ""have you seen that lady by the door? She's been standing there behind you for a while now. She might need your help"".

There was no lady by the door and she was the only patient at that side of the hallway. If we do have some patients they are in their room and not ambulating since most can't ambulate on their own and definitely one of the staff will be heading directly to that patient if they were ambulating for risks of fall. Our patients are mostly old so with that being said, our aide quickly did what needed to be done and helped the patient settle in the bed so he can leave the room as fast as possible. He was terrified as he recalls it to me.

One time we had a low census in the unit. That means most of the rooms are vacant since we only have so few patients. Now here's the thing, I do have my own assignment of patients but I never particularly mind where other patients are situated that time. I usually go to the restroom by the end of the hallway passing by room 20. All night, every time I pass that room towards the restroom I always feel like there was something off in the room. The room was particularly dark and I was thinking maybe the patient wants it that way so he can sleep. The room's door is slightly open halfway but I can still inside the room. Though it is dark, I can still see silhouettes or outlines like the bed inside the room. All night long when I pass that hallway I really thought there was a patient in there and to my surprise an aide of ours went in the room to set it up for an admitting patient, I was shocked and baffled that it was empty all along. 

Why was I confused to know it was empty? Because all night long I felt a presence in that room which made me think that there was indeed a patient in there. That definitely creeped me out.

Patients also reported of sounds like walking on the wall or ceiling. I would understand and shrug it off if they described it as walking outside their doors since we always walk on the hallway, that's not something paranormal. However the patient described the sound like it was inside the room and on the walls which is very weird.

Thanks for reading and God Bless."
"Them Soldiers Is Dead/civil War","Georgia","Haunted Places","I've written here about a few things related to family members who've died, but it was an incident about three years ago that was a watershed moment for me when it comes to believing in the paranormal. Before this incident, I rationalized that I probably just WANTED things to happen that I could say were related to my deceased family members. Even though I was open-minded about things, when they would happen my attitude was one of ""OK, THAT's interesting, but we'll never really know if it's really supernatural."" 

And then I went for a walk at a nearby Civil War battlefield and found it IS real. 

I prefer not to name the specific place, and there's a reason for that. There is very little on the internet about this area being haunted and I think that's good. I consider this to be hallowed ground and a safe place, very near my neighborhood, and I wouldn't want to attract people who don't care about the area or are just coming to stir things up or perhaps do weird ceremonies... Or who might not respect the soldiers who gave their last full measure. I'd like to recount my experiences at this place in the order that I remember; some of it might not be pertinent, but one of you might catch something I've missed. 

So this battlefield is a National Park, and it's also got miles of trails to walk upon. When I was younger, I'd run the trails every so often, but for some reason, even though it has the perfect, shaded dirt paths, I never really felt good about running there. Once, at least ten years ago, while walking with some neighbor ladies, I got such an uncomfortable feeling that I told them to run... They just thought it was about exercise, I never told them it was pure anxiety and a real flight reflex (in the light of day). At that time, I'd never felt that way in my life. I'm rarely afraid.

At this park, there is a visitor center that's usually quite busy, with parking lots and sometimes re-enactments. But in a more remote part of the park there is a monument that was paid for by the people of Illinois in memory of their boys who died in one terrible battle in 1864. About 15 years ago, I wanted to take my then-boyfriend to see this monument. He was from out west and military, and I thought he would appreciate some Civil War history. After you park in the lot, you have to go down a path that's flanked by the dirt battlements, which were the positions of the southern cannon at the top of a steep hill about the length of a football field and a half. The tall monument stands at the top of this hill, and as we walked towards it the air seemed to get more humid (if that's possible here) and the surrounding woods went dead quiet. We noticed a half dozen deer gazing at us from the tree line in a strange way. I can't think of a good way to explain it. Neither of us said anything at that time, but both were surprised to discover much later that we both felt something strange. 

Fast forward. My pre-teen son and I went for a walk there 3 years ago in September. It was a Tuesday, a day off school, and it was about 2pm as we approached from the downhill direction (the way the Union Army would have been approaching before the battle). The path we were on goes a little ways down to a creek, which is also the tree line where the Union troops would've been waiting and gathering. I had a new I-phone and took it out to take some photos of my son on the little bridge there. On a whim, I decided to walk up the hill with the recorder on. I had been hearing some disembodied yells as we approached the area, but I assumed it must be some kids on the path in the trees. Could this have been the subconscious reason I turned the recorder on? I don't know, I've never tried to do EVPs, though had seen it on tv. I felt a little embarrassed and I also did not want my son to see what I was doing. But I did it anyway. 

We walked up the hill of the battlefield. About halfway up I asked my son if he heard the yells coming at regular intervals, maybe every two minutes. He said he did. He stood on a tree stump and waited while I huffed my way up the hill. We got to the top, took a few more photos at the monument and then went back home, only passing one older couple the entire hike. 

When we got home, I listened to the tape (I still call it a tape, sorry) and definitely heard the yells. So did my husband. We also heard a sound that my military husband said ""has the sound and cadence of artillery fire"" which we had NOT heard in person. And finally, when we turned up the volume, we realized we really had an EVP. 

When standing at the bottom of the hill, I captured a male voice saying, ""There's something here I don't trust..."" with a female laugh. At the point I asked my son if he heard the yells, on the tape you can hear a VERY deep voice say ""hear"" and then, before my son answers, a young boy's voice, very close to me, can be heard saying, ""them soldiers is dead."" A minute later the same voice says, ""what's that?"" and I remember standing there and holding my phone out in front of me. 

As I told my husband, I could not have come up with that line ""them soldiers is dead"" if my life depended on it. I'm particular about grammar. 

The boy in the recording sounds younger than my son. And closer to me than he was.

I was amazed. Then I didn't listen to it for a long time. What can you do with it? Then the kids went to camp -- months later -- and my husband and I went out to dinner near the battlefield and had a glass of wine and discussed it again. We decided to stop by, nearing dusk on that summer evening. There were quite a few people at the monument. As we sat on a bench at the top of the battlefield, I thought I felt something touch the back of my hair and reached up to swat something away. Only later, thinking about it, I realized it was not a bug, or anything else I could think of. It was like my hair flipping. Then we walked to the bottom of the hill to the tree line. Husband mentioned that it smelled just like the wet canvas of old fashioned military tents. ""You never forget that smell,"" my skeptic said, and I just answered, ""Well, I don't see any wet canvas in these woods, do you?"" He walked up the hill ahead of me, back to the parking lot, while I took my time trying to feel anything. I finally started up, somewhat disappointed that everything seemed normal. But as I walked up I got so winded... By the time I crested the hill, where the most men had died and been burned, I felt like I'd run a marathon, could barely catch my breath and had to stop and lean on a fence a minute before making it to the car. At that moment I thought, WOW am I getting old and out of shape. But just a few weeks later, my son and I went to take photos for a school project and I walked up without even being winded, like it was NOTHING. That's when I realized my previous experience, getting winded on that hill, was more about anxiety and perhaps what those soldiers were feeling as they ran up that forlorn hope to their deaths. 

I drive by this place all the time, but have not been back since my son needed the photos, over a year ago. I'm a little afraid to go back, even though I'm truly enamored by the place and tons of people walk there every day, and pay tribute to the fallen troops. I found this website when I was looking for anyone else who had an experience there.

One more quick thing: I sent my EVP to a local Civil War historian with my thoughts. He e-mailed back that he couldn't hear a thing. I really don't believe him. I believe he heard it, but won't admit it. He did tell me, however, that the battle that took place killing more than 3,000 men in an hour on that hill happened after the Union troops had been mired in our area with daily rainstorms that kept them and their equipment soaked for more than a month. Wet canvas. That bit of information was something. Would love to hear your thoughts."
"She Came To Let Me Know","Oregon","Family / Friends Visits","I have a Facebook account I use for family out of state. One late night in June of 2014 I logged on to find a message from my cousin I grew up with back home in North Carolina. She told me my aunt died. She was the last of the sisters on our moms' side. I was so surprised and, of course, sad. I started remembering things she had shared with me: favorite recipes, her favorite flowers, and how to make your own hummingbird food. I loved her, I will forever love her. 

In deep thought of memories about her from my last trip back home, I was listening to music and playing a few songs of my own when I realized how hot it was inside the house. I got up to open all the windows to air out the place. When I went into the spare bedroom to open that window (it's never closed in the summer) I happened to look down on the hardwood floor. To my total shock there lay two perfect locks of red hair?! Of course I immediately thought of my aunt, she had red hair.

I turned all the lights on and held those locks of hair in my hand, staring at them in amazement! It's so hard to tell anyone if you have ""happenings"" or paranormal events, because there's usually no proof of it. My boyfriend also never sees anything like I do, so I couldn't wait for him to wake up and show him what I found! 

The thing that really gets me about this is my aunt wasn't religious and had a cousin back home in North Carolina that was a preacher. My aunt's heart had become hardened because of her youngest son's death. 

I was back home visiting her and all my cousins one summer years ago when we got invited to a potluck at the church where her cousin preaches. My aunt Katie said she was only going because we were there visiting and for the food, ha! When we got there her cousin went on and on about how wonderful it was to see her there in church. She said ""I'm only here for the food!"" When he left our side I said, ""But what if it's true, what if there is an afterlife?"" She thought a while and then turned to look me in the eye saying, ""I""ll let you know when I die."" 

It's been 5 years now since she died, and it crosses my mind from time to time about what she said. I have that red hair in a little box. I was a little girl the last time I saw my aunt with her natural red hair. She was in her 80's with grey hair when she died, but I know it was her letting me know there IS something more than just this life. 

I nor my boyfriend has ever had any family locks of red hair. Later I was vacuuming the floor when the vacuum started making a funny noise. I turned it off and flipped it over. There in the middle of the brush rollers was a clump of red hair!? It was so thick I had to get a pair of scissors to cut it out?!"
"The Hall Of Horror","Indiana","Haunted Places","Growing up in my aunt's house was absolute torture. We had to move out of my grandma's house and into her house because it was closer to a better school for me and my brother. 

It was my 10th birthday when the activity started. I was having a sleepover with my friend, and it was around 4:00 in the morning. She looked up, then turned pale white. I asked her what was wrong and she pointed at the wall. I looked up and saw a clear as day shadow person. It was completely black. When I looked up at it, it just turned around and walked away. 

I ran down the hall and woke up my dad and told him what happened, but he just laughed it off saying we were tired, which I believed for a while. Then I started thinking, if we were both tired, would we have seen the same thing? 

I didn't know if that was it at the time, but not even a month later I got my answer. It was real. It was the middle of the night and I had the weirdest nightmare that I don't really remember, but when I woke up, there was a yellow figure on top of me. It was huddled on top of me holding my arms and legs down, it turned its head and slowly evaporated. 

Every night until we moved since that night there was something behind the bedroom door. I used to sleep with the hall light on and the door open. I'd wake up in the middle of the night to a thing I can only describe as darkness peaking at me from behind the door, like going out and in like it was scared. 

One morning I woke up on a Saturday. My brother and I shared a bedroom at the time. My brother had already woken up and I saw a little boy sleeping on my brother's bed. I just left the room and let the little boy sleep there. 

There was another night where I was sitting on the couch reading a book and, I'm not joking, heard an evil laugh. It sounded like my dad slightly, so I looked up, thinking he was home playing a joke, but when I did a shadow man floated through my legs and into the wall. I stared at the wall trying to find it. For a few minutes, I couldn't walk. It was around 11:00, I was playing with my toys and I saw the shadow of my dad coming down the hall, laughing. It was him. It was shaped like him and the laugh was his, I heard him snoring in his room at the same time. 

One day me and my brother were going to scare my mom when she came home from work with Nerf guns, and I saw the shadow walk down the hall behind him. 

To this day, when I visit my aunt's house, I won't go into the hall after dark."
"Spirit Wind","Oklahoma","Misc","This event occurred when I was a teenager living in Lawton, Oklahoma. I have never forgotten it.

During one November weekend, I spent the night at my friend Steve's house. During this period, Steve's church was performing an all-weekend prayer vigil for a reason that I have since forgotten. Steve had signed up to pray during a 30-minute period beginning at three in the morning. 

On Friday afternoon of the previous day, Steve invited me to wake up with him and travel to his church to pray with him. I agreed and after going to bed at Steve's house Friday night, we woke up at 2:30 to make the trip over to his church.

Steve lived a couple of hundred yards from the junior high that we both attended and his church, the First United Methodist, was across the street from that same school. It did not take long for Steve's father to pack us up in his station wagon and drive us the short distance in the frosty morning to the church.

The church was an enormous structure and as we entered, I got the distinct impression that we were entering a cave. The only lights in the whole building were the candles glowing at the altar that the prayerful had left during the prayer vigil. I could not see the ceiling and, after approaching next to the altar, I looked back and could not see the back of the church in the darkness. I could tell that Steve's father had settled into one of the back pews because I could hear him shifting around in the pew. 

There was a woman at the altar and when she saw us approach, she muttered a hushed ""hello"" and got up to leave. I listened to her footfalls and watched her disappear into the darkness. Seconds later, I heard her open the door. When she did, the street light at the front of the church briefly lit the interior of the church before the door closed behind the woman to leave us once more in the inky, candlelit darkness. 

I sat on the front pew behind Steve and watched as he knelt at the altar and began to pray. I do not recall him spending too much time at prayer before watching him grasp a nearby straw, light it on a candle, and use the lit straw to light an unlit candle. He then began to get up to join me at my pew when a cold wind from the back of the church blew over us, flickered the candles, and extinguished the candle that Steve had just lit. I looked at the back of the church to see who had just entered, but I could not see anything in the darkness. Steve was already facing the back of the church so I asked him, ""Who just came in?""

""I don't know. We still have about fifteen more minutes before my prayer time here is over. It's too early for the next person. I didn't see anyone open the door in the back,"" Steve replied.

""Are you already done praying, then?"" I asked.

""Yeah, I'm not too good at praying for more than a few minutes,"" Steve said.

""Well, you should at least go back and relight your candle. That gust of wind blew it out,"" I observed.

""Where did that wind come from?"" Steve whispered.

""I don't know. I was thinking about going back there to see if your dad saw anybody, but I can hear him snoring in the back,"" I replied.

""Stay where you are then, I don't want to be here at the altar alone while I go back and relight my candle,"" Steve said.

Steve turned around and selected another straw from the altar and lit it on another candle. He then lowered the lit piece of straw onto the candle that he had just previously lit. After lighting the candle, he blew out the straw and placed it back into the holder next to the candles. It was at this time that another cold gust of wind blew into our faces from the front of the church, flickered the candles again, and again extinguished Steve's freshly-lit candle - leaving all of the other candles lit in their places!

Steve looked back at me with a look of fright - I have to say that I was also a little frightened. I immediately got up and stood next to Steve and whispered, ""Steve, I think we should pray a little longer this time. Move over, I'll join you.""

We both knelt at the altar and started fervently praying. I do not know how long we were there at the altar, but we were both presently disturbed by the sound of someone walking up behind us and patiently sitting in the front pew. I nudged Steve and watched him slowly light a straw and carefully place it upon an unlit candle. The candle lit. We both waited for several seconds to see what would happen. When the candle stayed lit, we both got up and walked back to the rear of the church. The man sitting on the front pew then took our place and knelt at the altar and started praying. 

After waking up Steve's dad, we all left the church, got into Steve's station wagon, and drove back to the house.

The next morning, we told Steve's parents about what had happened in the church while Steve's dad was sleeping. Surprisingly, all that his dad could say was, ""Well, I guess someone ""upstairs"" wasn't satisfied with your first efforts.""

 It was just as good an explanation that Steve and I could offer for the night's events."
"Dog With Heterochromia Sees Ghosts","Colorado","Pets / Animals","A little back story first. I talked to a native Indian a while ago while I had my Rottweiler Husky x with Heterochromia (two different colored eyes) and he told me how his tribe believes beings and animals with Heterochromia can see the living world as well as the ghost world. I thought that was very cool but never thought much of it. 

Well, a couple days ago I started hearing strange noises around my apartment mostly in my hallway, the bathroom and kitchen. Mind you, I live alone with my two dogs (Rottsky 2 years and Blue Heeler 6 months). I hear noises like the water running in my bathroom, the sound of my door handles turning, and doors closing, as well as footsteps in my bathroom/kitchen. 

My Heeler, who I should point out is completely deaf, is always around me as he is very dependent and attached to me but a couple days ago he started whining very loudly and almost panicking if he was not touching me. He could be sitting right next to me but unless he was touching me he was super upset. I just thought he was being very clingy that day. 

Later in the night we were all three laying in bed just relaxing before bedtime and he jumped up from a dead sleep, stared at the wall by my door that connects to the bathroom, and was barking and growling with his hackles all the way up. He then put his ears straight forward with his teeth baring and charged towards the wall snapping as if he was warning someone or something to back off but then calmed down and came back to the bed, while my Rottsky just watched intently. At that point I was very scared because there is no way he heard anything over there and there were no shadows in that corner of the room. 

The next morning I was sitting on my couch with my Rottky while my Heeler was playing by the front door. She sits with her butt on the couch and her two front paws on the floor and just looks around, mostly watching Oaklee (Heeler) as he is non-stop! 

Randomly she started watching the kitchen area and slightly moving her ears back and moving her head as if she was watching someone walk around. She does not wag her tail much unless she is very excited and mostly shows her emotions with her ears. Out of nowhere she dropped her ears back and started smiling and wagging her tail, she dropped her head down and watched something walk from my kitchen to my front door area where Oaklee was and right when Bonnie (Rottsky) looked the direction of Oaklee, he went into his attack mode. His bark so so high pitched and sharp as if he got scared. 

I am assuming the different reactions by both dogs show that the superstition I was told about Heterochromia may just be true! Bonnie is very protective of her home and won't just let someone walk around, so I am assuming whatever she sees in my apartment she trusts; however, she gets excited when she sees whatever she sees walking around while Oaklee just feels something and gets aggressive. 

It is very cool to see all this with both of them but it is also very scary. I wonder if anyone else has experienced things like this with their dogs or cats with Heterochromia."
"A Ghost I Can't Escape","Ohio","Ghost Hunting","Early this year, three friends and I decided to go on a late night adventure and explore a nearby abandoned house. The previous owner of the house was purportedly an abuser, and lived there with his wife and some children.

 The house was brimming with stuff- the floors were covered in left-behind items. You could barely walk through all of the trash. Rosey's earrings fell out even though they had been tightly secured. We all separated and went off to explore the house.

 I kept getting lost. It seemed so big, and the rooms seemed like they kept switching places. I found my way upstairs, with my friend Rem following close behind. It was an attic. The floor was coated in old photographs. Hundred of old photographs, still intact. I collect old portraits, so I rummaged through them and looked around- and one snapped my attention to it- it was a photo of a child- very old- black and white- it locked eyes with me- an intense presence filled the room- my friend and I both had a vision and felt the energy of a toddler running around the room. 

We fled downstairs. Upon reaching the main floor, right at the bottom of the steps, tears started pouring down my face. I didn't know why- I wasn't emotional and I was barely scared. I moved away to find my friends again, and the tears actually evaporated from my face. I moved back into the spot I stood before, and tears poured from my eyes. Back and forth, back and forth... Tried and true, every time I would move back, I would inexplicably sob, and every time I moved away my tears vanished. The face of a woman flashed into my head. Dark hair, mournful. Her energy was tied to where I stood. Something horrible happened there. 

I joined my three other friends, and set up a piece of paper with 'yes' and 'no' written on it, with the pencil set right in the center so we could talk to spirits and they could answer us by turning the pencil to whichever word they preferred. Lucas found an old lamp, filled the bowl with paper, and set it on fire. We tried engaging whatever spirits were in the house, but the pencil on the paper never moved.

 Rosey and I saw a massive yellow orb by the basement door, and the most grimy presence choked the air. Out of nowhere the flame in the lamp went out. Mind you, there was no wind- the house was sealed. My legs went absolutely weak for no reason. Rem grabbed me and started yelling because he heard voices in his ear. The sounds of footsteps echoed behind us. Lucas grabbed the paper in the bowl- it was ice cold. Seconds before, it had been burning violently. We grabbed our stuff and ran for our lives. 

I froze by the basement door. I couldn't move. I had another vision, and felt an awful, disgusting energy from the basement. Vision of the woman from before, in a chair, tied, her husband beating her. She was screaming. She told me to get out! Get out! I unfroze and ran. She appeared behind me as I ran, looking almost demonic, hair a mess and teeth bared. She was running after me. I jumped into the car and slammed the door shut. She slammed her hands on the door. She wanted in. She wanted in. We drove off into the night. She appeared in the car. She's been in the car ever since. It's my car. I still have items in there from the house. 

I went back a month or two ago with Lucas, and all of the spiritual energy was gone from the house. It was entirely cleansed, or at least seemed that way. It had been cleaned up a bit by someone to prepare it for being sold. The house was so small. Smaller than before. Lucas thought so too. It had shrunk, and the spirits had left, and the rooms were exact and didn't trick you anymore. I took some more items home with me, but kept them in my car. The woman still appears sometimes. I have visions of her, I feel her energy. I cannot escape her. Rosey now believes in ghosts. She didn't before. Lucas loves the house and wants to live there. Rem never wants to go back. He knows it's evil. I am obsessed with the house. I think about it every day. The woman from the house haunts me, and the house itself haunts me. I'm tired."
"The Voices That Shake The Bed","Wisconsin","Haunted Places","So this happened when I was about 15 years old, I believe.

For years, actually as long as I can remember, I could hear voices when I ""listened."" If you don't know what I mean by that, you probably can't understand. But I call it channel 1 and channel 2. 

Channel 1 is the normal way you hear things. Channel 2 is the other way. Sorry, if you don't understand what I mean by that. I'm not expert enough in this stuff to explain, or even to defend it as a real thing. I have no idea how it works, but in channel 2 you can hear all kinds of things; voices, music, moaning, laughing...

It all sort of depends on what is in the air around you at the time. Some locations are thick with it, some aren't, but it's all there in the wind. That's when I heard it best, anyway. 

At night though, when the wind is blowing, mostly it's just voices. Not a single voice, but a distant babble hard to ignore - because it gets louder if you listen close and it's hard not to listen in the dark. Worse, if you listen too close in the wrong place on the wrong night, other things started happening. Mostly at night, but not always, as in this story.

This happened in broad daylight. I was laying in bed at my brother's place. It was a small apartment on Mather street he shared with my cousin near the Fox River in Green Bay, WI. I crashed there sometimes. Well, this particular day, the voices were very loud and I was very tired because I had been up all night, but I couldn't fall asleep because the voices kept getting louder beneath me until it felt as if the bed was shaking under me. 

Now, that might seem terrifying at first glance, but it had happened before, and I had then, and still have, a simple rule about weird stuff: If someone else didn't see it, feel it, or hear it, then it isn't real. Zero exceptions. 

So, the wind is blowing outside, and I'm trying to sleep, and for almost an hour I tried to ignore the ""hallucination"" keeping me awake until, tired and frustrated, I got out of bed and went into the living room where my cousin Todd was talking to a couple girls who lived nearby and were over for friendly flirting or whatever.

 I asked if Todd could come talk to me for a minute in the bedroom. He agreed and followed me into the room where I shut the door behind him.

""What's up?"" Todd asked, (I'm paraphrasing. I honestly don't remember exactly what he said.) And I asked him to sit down on the bed a second.

And that's about as long as he did sit down before he jumped up like something but him and started cursing and staring at the bed.

Cutting into the story a second; another of my little rules regarding weird stuff is that I never tell someone with me what it is I see or hear. I ask what the person with me sees or hears, so I know they actually do see or hear whatever it is I think I see or hear. Lol. 

Sorry, if that's seems sort of burdensome, but it's the only way I can really know for sure they are being honest with me. 

Trust issues? Possibly. But that doesn't mean they aren't out to get me.:) 

""The bed is $&@! Shaking!"" Todd said.

At which point, feeling entirely vindicated, I pumped my fist and said, ""I f&&$ing knew it! I knew it!""

Then we swore a lot more (we were both teenagers and thought that made us adults I suppose) and the bed eventually stopped shaking, and I felt very pleased with myself, and Todd decided the house was haunted, or more likely I was haunted.

But that didn't ruin my mood because this had been going on for years, and hurray! I wasn't crazy.

And then it started getting dark.

 I realized all those nights I heard voices and the bed was shaking might not have been hallucinations. And I started wishing I hadn't had Todd come sit on the bed."
"Weird Forest Encounter","Iowa","Misc","I have a lot of encounters from ghosts, but this one is a little different. Different because I'm not sure what exactly was encountered, but I'm hoping maybe someone can read this and shed a little light on this experience. 

So, this was when I was probably about 17. I was out hanging out with my boyfriend at the time and one of his friends. Now, one thing to put out there, is that his friend was a pretty ""outdoorsy"" kind of guy. He wasn't scared of much, he grew up hunting, and was always out exploring the woods at all hours. Living in a small town with a lot of parks and surrounded by wooded areas, there wasn't a lot to do so exploring the woods was a typical thing for really any of us to do. I never used to be afraid of the woods, until after this experience.

This particular night, his friend decided that he wanted to go spotlight hunting (yes illegal, but we were kids and I had no idea). We drove out to an area on a gravel road in my boyfriend's car. There used to be a bridge that went across the river but it was burnt and eventually torn down so it was closed off and the end of the gravel had become overgrown with grass, weeds, and such. There's a tall bridge off in the distance, actually it's a bridge our little town is very well known for as it has a lot of history. We were out there, miles away from town and from any houses. We found a place to pull over near the end of the gravel and my boyfriend and his friend grabbed the rifle out of the trunk and their flashlight. Me being an animal lover, I didn't feel like taking part so I chose to stay in the car. Before my boyfriend took off into the field, he told me to give them 15 minutes and if they didn't come back I could take his car and leave them. With that, they disappeared into the dark.

So there I was, sitting in his car. There was a metal railing in front of the car that we had pulled up to, which the guys had to climb over. On both sides of the car there was tall grass, taller than the car. It was a bit spooky but I tried to keep my mind busy. I turned the radio on and waited. 15 minutes went by and they still weren't back. I hadn't heard any gunshots so I figured maybe they just weren't having any luck. Then, I get this weird feeling. The feeling of being watched. Enough to make the hairs on your neck stand up. I tried to play it off as my nerves. I look out my window to the right and I see the tall grass moving. I told myself it was the wind. I look out the driver side window, the grass over there stood still. I've seen enough horror movies to know that I didn't want to look out the right window again. Ignorance is bliss right? I look down at my phone and do everything I can to not look up, scared I might see something I didn't want to see. Then... Something hit the back of the car. Pretty hard. I look back, but with the tint and the darkness, it was impossible to see anything. So, I check the locks to make sure I was safe and turned up the radio. The knocking on the trunk and back window continued on and off. At this point it had been an hour since they left and I was hoping it was just them trying to play a joke on me. I knew I couldn't leave them out there, and there was no way I was getting out of the car, so there I sat, trying to ignore whatever was out there. The knocks soon turned to shaking the car. I shrank down in my seat and just kept my eyes on my phone. Waiting for the guys to get back. After about 15 minutes the banging stopped and I was left in silence for about another 15 minutes when I hear the guys yelling. I sat up, flipped on the headlights, to see my boyfriend (who had never touched a gun in his life) running towards the car, cradling the rifle in his arms, and vaulting over the metal railing. His friend came running soon after. I unlocked the doors, my boyfriend jumped in the driver's seat, throwing the gun in the backseat where his friend was scrambling to get in, yelling ""go! Go! Go!"" He quickly backed out and off we sped down the gravel road. My boyfriend's face was filled with terror and he starts yelling at his friend, ""what the hell was that man?!"" His friend is looking out the back windows terrified and exclaims, ""it's following us!"" I was both scared and confused. I kept asking what they were talking about, and what happened but they were too busy trying to calm down. We sped as fast as his car could go back towards town. Once it was clear we were safe, I asked again what happened, only to be told they didn't want to talk about it. Whatever it was, it had scared them more than I've ever seen someone scared before.

We eventually get back into town, and pull up to his friend's house. We all just sat there in silence for a minute. Both guy's looked almost paralyzed trying to figure out what they had seen. His friend finally spoke, admitting that after whatever they encountered, he was scared to even be home alone. Reluctantly he got out of the car, grabbed his rifle, and headed inside. I questioned my boyfriend for the next several days but he always just got a weird look on his face and would shake his head, like he didn't believe it himself. It was apparent I would never know, and I guess a part of me was okay with that, so I stopped asking and life went on.

Ok, so now, 9 years later. And I finally got the answer. Like most high school relationships, my boyfriend from back then have been broken up for a long time, and I'm actually married now with two kids, and one on the way. Well, it just so happens, that my husband had this guy start working with him at work. It took a couple weeks and ""on the job stories"" from my husband to realize that this guy was the friend of my boyfriend all those years ago. I decided to open up to my husband and tell him about this horrifying experience we all had back then. Well, my husband is a big fan of a podcast called ""Dogman encounters"" he told me that a lot of the guests on the show had similar experiences that I did while I was in that car. That they would hear banging on the car and it would shake. Almost like it was trying to lure them out. I suggested that maybe he text the guy that he worked with (the friend of my ex) and ask him about that night. He did and the response was not what I was expecting.

He got a reply, the guy explaining how that night haunts him. He told about how they were out in the field, not having much luck. They heard a whole bunch of birds in the grass suddenly take flight making a ruckus and gave the guys a bit of a jump. They went over to the area with the flashlight on and that's when they saw 'him'. He said he was unusually tall and very skinny and lanky, as well as very pale. It was odd enough to see anyone out there at that time of night, let alone being out in a large field lined with forest. He just didn't belong. He then went on to say that the weirdest thing about this guy, was his voice. It was very abnormal, and unexpectedly high pitched, like a child. What did the guy say? Well this is the part that still sends shivers down my spine. Apparently he said,""you might want to check on that girl you left back in that car.""

This friend described how they ran back through the field, across a ditch and back to the car. He said they were running as fast as they could and this 'guy' was running parallel to them, but through the wooded area, a much harder route, and yet he was keeping perfect pace with them. The trees and terrain didn't slow him at all as they all sprinted back to me in the car. That's when we had started speeding back home. He said when he looked back, he saw the guy step over the metal barrier next to the road. They had to vault or climb over it, but this guy stepped over it like it was nothing. 

So here I am, my story has finally concluded after 9 years. Although I've tried researching similar encounters, I can't find anything. The only thing I know for sure, is whatever that was, it wasn't human. I don't know if it was a ghost, a mystery of nature or what. So I guess what I'm here for is to find out if anyone had heard, or had any personal experiences with something like this. I'm terrified to go back to that place, even in the daylight. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. I would love to solve this mystery. Thanks for reading!"
"One Last Visit","Illinois","Family / Friends Visits","We were moving from Chicago to San Francisco, and I left first, while my husband stayed with our Golden Retriever in the condo. It was in June 1999, and I was in a hotel in Reno when he called to tell me his father died.

A couple days after his father passed away, he was awakened in the night by what was clearly an intruder. Whoever broke in was right there in the room, and so my husband turned on the light. Our dog was just sitting there, alert, looking at something that nobody could see, turning his head in the way dogs do when they appear confused.

My husband was bothered because our ""watch dog"" wasn't going after the person who broke into our home. So, he got out of bed to confront the intruder. It's a mistake, we both know. But we often act on instinct in times like these.

There was a long corridor in our condo which led to the dining room then the kitchen toward a back door, out to a deck. So my husband followed out of the bedroom through the living room, only feet behind the footsteps through the corridor towards the kitchen. The footsteps faded as the visitor passed through the door onto the deck. There was no sound other than the footsteps.

The gait was uneven, with one foot landing harder than the other. His father had an injury which caused him to limp the same way.

My husband called his mother and said he had something he wanted to tell her. She said she didn't want to talk about it, knowing it was about his father. But he told her anyway. He described what happened that night to her. Her sister had written her a letter where she described a similar experience, having an intruder visit her in the night with an unmistakable gait that matched her husband's."
"Garage Door And Smoke Alarms","California","Family / Friends Visits","My mother died on April 28, 2012.

About a week after her death, I believe it was on May 7, we heard a noise and I looked out the window. It was dark outside, and I saw light coming out from the garage downstairs. So, I knew the garage door was opening. My husband and I went downstairs and observed that the garage door was opening and closing on its own. It would sometimes open or close only halfway. Very odd. I more or less dismissed this as some electrical malfunction. My husband felt like it was my mother sending a message. It never happened again.

My sister told me she astroplaned the night our mother died. I didn't take it seriously, and in fact forgot all about it. My husband told me I mentioned it to him, so definitely she told me this at some point. It's a different subject, but all she says she remembers is falling out of the ceiling into her bed sometime in the morning.

Fast forward to October 2019.

On October 18, my sister called and we talked about our mother. The next day, around the same time, about 7pm, both smoke alarms went off simultaneously, and there was no smoke. I pushed the button underneath the one in the foyer several times to quieten it, but it had no effect. Both smoke alarms stopped about a minute after they started. Very soon afterwards, my husband said it was my mother, and that it was because we were talking about her the day before. I recalled the garage door situation, and felt it was plausible.

My mother's birthday is October 22.

My sister lives in rural Indiana. Yesterday, October 24, she called. We talked about my husband's illness. Then she told me her best friend committed suicide. To change the subject, I told her about the smoke alarms.

A few seconds went by and my sister told me she had goosebumps from what I just told her. She said that she was cooking a pizza on our mother's birthday. There was no smoke in the house, and two of her smoke alarms went off. In the same fashion, they both stopped at the same time.

I believe my mother is trying to communicate."
"Shadow Figure Or Guardian Angel?","Kentucky","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I've searched this many times, with no luck finding anything on it. I'm not sure where else to post and ask questions. Here we go:

 When I was young, maybe 5-6, my family lived in a three-bedroom house. We had a few guests over one night, (my sister, her boyfriend, my sister's friend and my sister's friend's boyfriend) and the usual people who lived there were my mom, dad, and myself. My parents had a king sized bed, so my sister and all of her friends got to sleep in that bed all together. My parents and I squeezed into the twin size hospital bed we had for my grandpa who would soon move in with us. I woke up, maybe 2-3 in the morning, to go get more milk. I had the cutest cup. It was an elephant. His head came off and you poured the drink in, and his trunk was a straw! (Completely useless information that cup was just so cute.) 

 My bedroom was right across the hall from where I was sleeping with my parents, but at that time I did not sleep in my own bed, and I'm glad I didn't. As I walked out of the bedroom to get some more milk, I looked into my room. I saw a large figure, with huge glowing blue eyes. I couldn't really see a body, or even the shape of a head. I did see two huge eyes. Glowing with no light to illuminate them. I never felt scared of it. I stared at it, as it stared back at me. Now I'm not sure if it seemed so large because I was so little, but from what I can remember it looked to be as tall as my door, a standard door. The eyes of this were probably the size of a baseball each. Glowing white with blue as the color. Almost like someone was holding a flashlight behind them. Like I said I never felt scared, I thought it was probably a human, because at 5 you don't realize eyes that big are extremely abnormal. I continued on my mission to get more milk, and I guess things slowly started to process as I did, because when I was walking back to the room I shared with my parents, I was afraid to look into my bedroom.

 I woke my mom up, and told her someone was in my room. She got up out of bed and looked. We found nothing. I'm 21 now and I still wonder what I saw that night. I don't know how to explain it to people, and half of them tell me it was all just a dream. I'm sure it wasn't, because when I woke up for good later that morning, the milk I spilt was still left on the kitchen floor, and my cup was full. 

I've had small paranormal things happen as I've grown up. We moved to a new house and you'd see things out of the corner of your eyes, or hear people talking, the common stuff I guess. I've never seen those glowing blue eyes again, and I'm not sure I want to. I now live elsewhere with my fiance and I still feel things have followed me into my adult life. I feel uncomfortable alone in my house now and still see things. I'm not sure if something is attached to me, or if it's just the places I've lived. The blue eyes have never returned though. 

Anyone have an idea what I saw? I told myself it was my guardian angel for the longest time, but now I'm ready to get to the bottom of this."
"Pushed","Iowa","Haunted Places","It was a day like normal. I was heading down to the basement to do some laundry and cleaning next thing I know my cats started to freak out. I didn't know what was going on I have gone in the basement hundreds of times but nothing like this. The next thing I remember is I was at the bottom of the stairs and when I tried to push myself up off the floor I couldn't move my left arm. My friend called 911 and I went to the hospital and found out that I had shattered my elbow in 5 places. That night my boyfriend came over to help me get ready for bed and noticed that I had 5 perfectly noticeable finger prints on my back. We both had no idea where they came from. 

I also remember that when I first moved into the house outside I had seen what looked like a 10 foot tall something in a black cape with a tophat and bright red eyes. I have seen it one time after the incident and it was smiling with a grin that I will never forget.

 As of this time I hate going to the basement to do anything. I'm afraid that whatever is outside is now in my house. Everyday I start to notice that my cats will sit in front of the basement and hiss and growl. It's rather scary, since I live alone.

 I wish I knew what or who this thing was. If it had been alive or if someone is doing this to me. I have absolutely no idea. And recently I have been hearing sounds and voices down there. I have actually thought about putting a tape recorder down there to see if maybe I might be able to figure out what it wants or who brought it in my home."
"Too Much Time Frog-gigging","Oklahoma","Misc","I grew up next to a military base. My father, being a retired military veteran, enjoyed all the benefits of being able to travel on and off post anytime he wished. My father was also an avid outdoorsman, and he would spend all of his free time hunting and fishing on the military reservation. 

Our house was the first house built in our neighborhood. When it was completed, it was the only house visible for miles in every direction. It was so isolated that my father could sit out on the back porch and call quail up to our house using his abilities as a bird mimicker. 

After moving away from this house for a short period of time and returning a few years later, a small neighborhood had emerged around us and the city boundary had moved to include our property. Our house switched to city water and sewage, and the roads in our area became paved. We were still very close (approximately 200-300 yards) to the southern boundary of the military reservation, and during this time, this area of the military reservation permitted free access to anyone wishing to enter through and use the post as a shortcut to get to Interstate 44.

My father and I would often walk into the military reservation at night and go frog hunting around the many ponds scattered around the area. My father would call these ponds ""tanks"" and would spend his days fishing in them out of a small boat that he would carry in his truck. However, this story is about hunting bullfrogs. 

These frogs would grow to an enormous size, and after gathering a sack full of them, we would walk back to the house and give them to my mother who would cut off their legs and fry them for dinner.

The frog-gigging protocol was simple. I would carry the lantern and a large burlap sack and my father would carry a flashlight and a five-foot long stick topped with a small trident of sharp barbs. My father and I would wait for it to get dark and then we would proceed to walk to the nearest pond. The nearest pond was only a twenty-minute walk away (about a mile) and we could hear the croaking of the frogs long before we arrived at the scene. 

My father would walk in front, carefully scanning the ground for poisonous snakes, and I would follow behind. After reaching the pond, my father would slowly walk its perimeter with the flashlight pointed on the ground in front. My job was to hold the lantern high and keep an eye out for the glowing pinpricks of light reflecting off of small eyes that would warn us of an approaching water moccasin and to keep an eye out for rattlesnakes. 

My father would focus his light on the shore until he caught the eyes of a bullfrog. For some reason, the bullfrogs would ""freeze"" whenever they looked into the flashlight. My father would then lunge forward with his stick and gig the frog. He would then swing his stick towards me and I would enclose the frog within the burlap sack and pull it off of the stick. This would continue until we made one complete circuit around the pond. 

We would never make more than one circle around any one pond, and if we did not have what my father would decide as enough frogs, we would walk to the next pond. On most occasions, one circuit around the pond was usually sufficient and we would walk back to the house. We never went frog-gigging more than two times in any one month and I remember this activity with great fondness.

I remember receiving many visits from kinfolk during the summers of my childhood years. All of my relatives lived in Texas and they shared the same love for hunting and fishing as my father. 

On one occasion, my favorite aunt and uncle traveled up to visit us and Dad invited my uncle to go frog-gigging with us. This required a change of protocol. My father would still lead with the stick, but my uncle would follow with the burlap sack and I would bring up the rear holding the lantern.

We made our plans and waited for it to get sufficiently dark. At approximately 9:00 PM we marched out towards the first pond. I anticipated a hearty catch as the pond seemed to be especially noisy this night. After about twenty minutes, we arrived at the pond's edge. Just as we started to edge our away around the pond, we were startled out of our concentration when an extremely bright flash engulfed our area. I remember the flash being so bright that I could clearly make out colors and see with great detail the surrounding area. The flash of light seemed to take no more than three or four seconds before it winked out and left the three of us standing there in stunned silence. For some reason, the area was deathly quiet as even the bullfrogs seemed to have quit their croaking. 

The next few words uttered by my father and uncle still reverberate in my mind so many years later: ""Ray, I reckon' we should just start headin' back to the house.""

""Tom, I reckon you're right.""

I did not say a word and turned to follow my father and uncle back to our home. We arrived without incident and as I was getting ready for bed, I noticed from the clock on the wall that it was after three o'clock in the morning!

""Dad, what time do you have?""

""Go to bed, son. We'll talk about it in the morning.""

We never did talk about it after that and my father preempted my questions the next morning with the stern admonition to never mention the events of the past night to anybody else upon pain of punishment. I feared my father's belt and I would never bring up this incident again until many years later after my father had died. However, the incident seemed to die with my father as my uncle would not admit to any memory of the incident and he would casually dismiss any of my questions with the look of a man trying to placate the imaginings of an eccentric nephew. 

Little did I know at that time that this would not be my family's only brush with the phenomenon of missing time."
"The Crystal Ball","Oregon","Haunted Items","Several years ago I was in a book club when I noticed you could buy other things besides books. I saw a crystal ball and I really wanted one, so I ordered it.

When the crystal ball arrived there was a little booklet with it telling you how to use. It says to get comfortable, you can use it in the day or night. I chose the night time. You are to wash it in rose water or vinegar and sit it on a silk black cloth, which I did. It was also saying not to let it roll around, it came with a little wooden circle to place it on. I also used candles for lighting and incense for relaxation.

At first I saw a mist. I tried to write down all that I was seeing but my paper would disappear when I'd gaze into the ball again?! I saw different colors after a while and then I saw my two kids. They looked far away and were sitting down, my son had his face on the table for some reason. It says not to drop the ball. I was trying to get a better look into the ball next to the candle light when I dropped it! I grabbed it looking for any kinds of cracks, it didn't break. I could see through it perfectly in the candle light. Then slowly an eye started to form. It was now a perfect eye, it moved left and right, then blinked. That eyeball really freaked me out so I put it away and never tried to use it again.

It was a few years later that I ran across it again while moving. It was neatly packed in it's original box with the little booklet telling you how to use it. My book marker was still there where I had left off. I had never read the whole thing as I was in a hurry and just wanted to try and use it. So for the heck of it I continued reading. It said, ""you'll know you're on the right track when you see your crystal ball awaken. You'll see an eye slowly begin to open!"" 👁 That's exactly what happened...

I often wonder if I opened a door to ""the other side"" without realizing what I was doing, because I've had ""happenings"" ever since. We lived behind a graveyard at the time. I've since heard once you open that door you can never close it. Someone here on YGS reminded me of this story so I thought I'd share it."
"Black Panther Spirit In My Home","Missouri","Pets / Animals","I live in the city in an old Queen Anne style house that is quite large, built in 1902. There is a staircase in the back near the kitchen that I believe the servants used that go up to the third floor. The front staircase just goes to the second floor. 

Approximately three years ago, as I was walking down the back staircase, right in front of my eyes was an animal that was huge, totally black, sleek, with a long tail. Just its body alone filled up the doorway that leads into the kitchen. And the doorway was wide. At first, I thought that a stray dog had come into our house and felt a jolt of panic. We had four dogs at the time. I could not see the head of this animal as it's head was already past the door frame. I then realized it was not a dog but a large cat. It walked so gracefully yet there was an extreme power emanating from this animal. I could see the shiny fur and that long tail as it walked past the door into the dining room. As I looked around the corner it was gone. I went into freakout mode running throughout the whole house looking for it. It was gone. I have not seen it since.

 I have been researching all this time trying to figure out why it showed itself to me. My astral sign is Aries. My spirit animals, are hawk, tiger, and jaguar. So I don't know if this was a panther, or jaguar spirit. I did not feel afraid of it when I saw it, just awestruck. It was solid black and had no spots on it that I could see. It was not see through but solid black. If you have any ideas please let me know. I still haven't figured this out. Why did it appear to me walking past the doorway? Thank you"
"Voices At A School Playground","California","Haunted Places","I remember this experience like it was yesterday. About 25 years ago when I was only 7, my family and I visited my cousin and her family in Sacramento on a Saturday. They lived in an apartment right next to a cemetery with an elementary school right behind the apartment complex. This was definitely located in a rough neighborhood. My cousin, who was the same age as me, brought me and my older brother to the school's playground. My brother brought a basketball and played at the courts by himself and I was playing on the structure with my cousin. Randomly, my cousin said she had to run home with no explanation whatsoever. She just took off. For some reason, I didn't question her or decide to follow her. I just sat on the structure next to the slide. Then I heard what sounded like two voices, one on each side of my ears, grunting at me. I felt the presence almost like the voices came from two people standing on either side of me. My heart dropped and I wanted to faint. I screamed for my brother who was playing on the courts and before I can even tell him what was going on, he started sprinting off. I ran after him with my shoes halfway on. 

When we ran back to my cousin's house, my brother said he started running because he heard constant banging against the school bungalow and angry grunting voices chasing after him. We went upstairs to look for my cousin and when we entered her room, she was sitting on her bed, legs crossed, staring off into space. We screamed her name and she just slowly turned her head to look at us. She looked like she was drugged as just mumbled something to us. We couldn't figure out what she was saying so we just left her room. My brother and I then told our parents and aunts and uncles what happened to us, and they just laughed it off. When it was around dinner time, we all gathered at the dinner table and my cousin came out of her room from upstairs acting normal again. Like nothing happened. 

My brother and I remember everything to this day. We've reminded our cousin of that day numerous times and she cannot remember anything. We brought it up to her a couple months ago and, still, she didn't recall ever taking us to that school. I don't know if she was so scared that she just tried to shut that part of her memory out (she always seemed slightly annoyed every time we bring it up), or if she truly cannot remember. It was definitely one of the scariest moments I've ever experienced."
"Great-grandma Visiting Toddler At Night?","Ohio","Children Who See Spirits","This isn't a very ""exiting"" story, but nonetheless has my wife and I a little freaked out at the moment, and I thought was worth sharing. 

Back in April of this year (2019), my wife's grandmother passed away on our daughter's 2nd birthday. Our daughter had met her great-grandmother only a handful of times. My wife's grandma had been suffering from dementia since before the birth of our daughter. Our daughter shares the same middle name as her. I will refer to my daughter as ""Maggie"" for the purposes of this story. 

Maggie just turned two and a half. Her speech and vocabulary has improved tremendously over the past month or so to where she is now able to tell us about things, such as what she did today with the babysitter, who she saw today, etc. 

Last night, my wife was showing Maggie pictures on her phone. She came across a photo of her grandmother taken not too long before her death. Maggie says ""Oh, there's Nanna!""... Ok, so my wife and her sisters called their grandma ""Nanna"" when they were little. Nobody has used that name for her for years. We never taught Maggie that name for her (we would simply say ""great-grandma"" when referring to her). 

So here's what gets creepy. My wife asks our daughter ""how do you know Nanna?"" and Maggie makes a face and says ""I'm scared."" (I didn't even know she knew what ""scared"" means by the way)... My wife asks ""why are you scared?"" and Maggie says ""Nanna's in my room"". So we asked her several times to clarify where she sees Nanna, and she would either say ""in my room"" or point upstairs. Then she tells us ""Nanna sings songs"". 

So we were all pretty freaked out. I'm not sure that a two and a half year old is developed enough where she can tell stories. We started showing her random pictures of other senior citizen women and she had no reaction to any of them; then we would slip in different pictures of my wife's grandma and Maggie would point and say ""Nanna."" I get that she's probably at a new stage in life where she is starting to get to be afraid of things, but... Still, super creepy.

If my wife's grandmother is truly visiting our daughter in her room, I hope she realizes that she is scaring her and will maybe tone it down some. My big concern is that it is someone else. We bought this home from an elderly couple who has both since passed. I'll keep an eye on things and hopefully this doesn't go anywhere further. Thanks for reading!"
"White Eye Entity","Louisiana","Haunted Places","It's crazy just think about the whole experience. In 2017, I was in the bathroom soaking up in a nice spiritual bath I found that is suppose to clean my aura. I got a pound of baking soda, sea salt, and sprinkle some basil into my water.

I live in my grandparents house and I would experience a lot of activities. But I caught something on my cell phone photo while I was soaking. I felt like something was in the bathroom with me. I would hear distinction voices talking in the house a lot along with shadows and knocking. While I was in the tub soaking... I was already feeling uneasy so I took a picture by my legs were I felt most uneasy. Something came out in my picture. It looks like a snake mouth with white eyes a nose and it's mouth to the left of my picture as of it was leaving me. I saved it.

 Things like jars and different objects would fly or break clean in half out my hands. At night I would hear knocking on the wall of my room by my papa's side of the bed every time I would sleep on his side. I opened the drawers and look to see where it was coming from. I had no explanation. I would see shadows moving along the walls and I start to think I was crazy and I grew very very depressed and weary of negative feelings that was not my own... Thought of suicide, death, evil things that didn't belong to me as if I was possessed. I moved out but it maybe followed me. 

 I recently lost my father as well and I was there when he took his last breath. When he did I saw purple light move from out of him floating on his head. I see them a lot they turned yellow, pink and white, blue but mostly I see purple lights and white sparkles a lot as if they were stars shining."
"Animal Guardians","Arizona","Pets / Animals","Shorty

I was on duty as a security officer for a financial call center when I noticed a cat that was killed and was laying in the front yard of the property. He appeared to have been hit by a car.

After laying him to rest (and a good half hour of bawling my eyes out), I was inside a vacant office suite talking to a friend of mine about what just happened when I thought I heard one of her cats meowing in the background. I asked her ""Ahh which kitty witty just said hi?"" My friend said that both of the cats were asleep in the window. I asked if she was sure of this, and she said they were both sleeping in the window. 

We were both perplexed by this and my friend said that it might have been the cat I just laid to rest a few minutes before. I was comforted, knowing that ""Shortstop or ""Shorty"" was ok and was saying thank you to me for taking the time to properly lay him to rest. I never spoke to anyone about the encounter in the vacant suite, but I know that Shorty still comes around me from time to time. 

Aztec

In September of 2016 I had just recently put my horse Aztec to sleep after losing a battle with a hindgut fissure. I was devastated. About a week or two later I had a dream that I was inside a slaughterhouse where I was going toe to toe with the plant manager. Just as the man I was arguing with started to take a swing at me, Aztec materialized (he was dead in the dream) in full form with red eyes and he was angry. He reared up on his back legs, bringing both his front hooves down on top of the plant manager's head, killing him. After the upheaval ended, I was able to hug Aztec around the neck like I always did before he vanished from sight. On the floor in front of me, there were two bloody hoof prints. 

I woke up in the morning, convinced that my horse watches over me. I have had sensations where I have smelled the scent of horses while in the middle of a security shift at 1:00 in the morning."
"Military Ghost Story","Hawaii","Haunted Places","My name is Mike. I'm a US Army veteran and this is a true story of events which occurred during my time stationed in Hawaii. I am writing it to the best of my memory of the occurrences. The exact address and community name have been omitted as it is not my intention to negatively impact the housing community where these events took place. I will start with how I arrived there to begin with. 

The story begins in late 2011. I had just completed basic training at Ft. Jackson, South Carolina and was living at Fort Eustis, Virginia. My wife Nicole lived in apartment off base while I stayed on base during the week, finishing up my military job training at the Army Aviation Logistics School on base. 

I completed my training after several months and found out, to my astonishment, that the Army would be stationing me in Hawaii with the 25th Infantry Division. It was very short notice and there was little time to prepare but luckily we didn't have a lot of stuff to move at the time. 

Nicole was a little stressed to move across the world on short notice, especially never having lived so far from family and home, but she was also very excited at the thought of living in Hawaii of all places, as was I. Hawaii is an exciting place to be at any age but Nicole and I were both in our early 20s and ready to hit the beach. 

Preparing to leave Virginia, we shipped out our furniture, took a road trip to visit some family and say goodbye, then upon our return to Virginia we shipped our car out as well. The Army provided us each one way airline tickets to Oahu, Hawaii and we were on our way. 

It seemed too good to be true. We had only seen Hawaii in postcards and on TV or in magazines. It was a place where rich old people went or couples went for a short honeymoon. It was hard to imagine what it was going to be like when we looked out the airplane window and saw Waikiki Beach, Diamond Head volcano, and Pearl Harbor. I closed my eyes and slept. 

A long flight later we finally heard the Captain call over the intercom system that we were approaching Oahu. Minutes later we arrived over Oahu during the daylight. It was unbelievable to see from the sky. The water was so clear and blue. We exited the plane. 

It was a little while before Christmas and it was in the 70s. We rented a car at the airport, checked into our hotel and started to drive around exploring Pearl Harbor and the rest of the island before heading back to our hotel for the night. 

I checked in at the Army base and began a long process of paperwork and immunizations, introductory briefings and so on. The process took multiple days and in a few days or a week I was done and heading to my new unit where I was assigned. 

My wife and I had found the perfect spot to call home. A decent-sized rental in the town of Kapoei, just down a short road from the beach. The neighborhood was peaceful, quiet and always well kept. All our personal property, as well as our car, arrived to the port in no time. We were soon set up and settled in. 

My unit was ramping up for a deployment to Khandahar Afghanistan with lots of work and lots of training. I began spending very long days at the base and weeks at a time on another island for training drills. The long hours at the base also meant I had our only vehicle most of the day. 

My wife, being alone all day, finally decided to adopt two dogs from the ASPCA which was very nearby. In fact, it was within walking distance at the time. Our dogs are both Pitbull mixes and, despite the reputation of the breed, they are more friendly and loving than most dogs I've ever known. The dogs kept my wife company and kept her busy. She began to train them and take them for long walks at the beach. It helped to pass time during the long days I worked at the base and the many weeks at a time I spent away at training off the island. 

When I was home we liked to spend our time together exploring the trails and other interesting places around the island. One day we started to explore the wooded area near our house. The surrounding area was called Barber's Point. 

We stumbled upon what seemed like sprawling flat level areas taken back by the vegetation. Upon walking around one could barely make out the ground underfoot was actually closer to a parking lot than soil. Grass had simply shot up through the broken aged and cracking surface which was once asphalt. We saw railroad tracks leading toward the beach with trees grown up through the wooden beams. 

The place had a very creepy feeling. It was still and silent but you could almost sense that the place was once booming with hustling, bustling work crews and noisy equipment whirring and grinding. There was once a lot of motion here. A lot of work took place here and it echoed with the voices of people long since passed. 

Researching the area later that night, we discovered that this was a staging area for WWII supplies to be used in island battles against the Japanese. It was used to prepare for battles like Iwo Jima, Okinawa and Tarawa in the bloody fight to storm beaches and take heavily fortified positions on Japanese islands. We had heard about many haunted areas around the island and brushed it off as people trying to be interesting, but something about this place really made the hair on our necks stand up. There was an energy still present behind that silent breeze, motion far beyond the gentle silent sway of the grass. Although desolate, there was the feeling of many eyes upon us from all around when standing in that place. 

The Hawaiian locals seemed to have a real understanding of spiritual phenomenon throughout the island and it's sometimes bloody history. There were many stories about the night marchers, the long dead warriors who roam the island. Ghostly drums and chanting have been heard on many occasions with no explanation as these ghostly groups pass through the night. 

Fascinated by these stories but bored at home one night, we decided to pull out our Ouija board and see if we could possibly contact a spirit on this ancient and historic island. ""Is there a spirit here who would like to communicate?"" We asked. The planchette moved to yes repeatedly. We asked ""Are you good or evil?"" At this point the planchette moved to the image of the moon on the board. ""How did you die?"" we asked. At this question the board spelled out a number. Just to make sure we weren't misreading, we asked again. It spelled out this same three digit number over and over again every time we repeated the question ""How did you die?"" 

Next we asked, ""Can you give us a sign if you are here?"" Suddenly our floor lamp flickered on, illuminating the dark room like a flash and then turned back off immediately. All questions afterward only moved to the moon over and over again with each question we asked. Getting nowhere we said goodbye and called it a night. 

Things were going great for a while but as time went on that all started to change. The dogs began to act strange in the house. Maybe they are just adjusting to life in our home, we thought. But as the days went by their strange behavior turned to downright creepy behavior. One night we awoke to the low sound of growling in the darkness, coming from the foot of the bed. I initially figured one of the dogs must be having a bad dream or hearing some off noises outside. With the light of my phone I sat up and peered down to find one of the dogs sitting up tall, fully attentive, ears perked and eyes staring straight ahead into the darkened hallway. He was staring with such focus and intent that I could swear there was someone standing just outside the doorway looking back at him from the dark hall near our stairway. He appeared to be staring up as if looking into the face of this invisible entity. A quick check with my phone light revealed no one there. This behavior became a common occurrence at night. 

One night I awoke to an especially horrible growling. This time at the left foot of the bed near the closet. I sat up and again, using the light of my phone, realized my dog was glaring straight up toward the attic door this time. The attic door was really just a wooden access panel on the ceiling of my walk-in closet. Birds? Maybe mice? I thought. I had to be up early so I calmed the dog, petted him and went back to sleep.

Every weekday, in the early mornings around 4:30 AM, I would walk downstairs, start some coffee and begin to get ready for morning exercises at the base. I always let the dogs outside while I got my bag packed and lunch ready. Once ready I'd let the dogs in, lead them back up to the room, kiss my wife goodbye for the day and head off to the base. 

The growling continued to occur from time to time until one weekday morning as usual I woke up at 4:30. The dogs stood up, yawning and stretched and shook off in excitement to go outside. I walked downstairs with the dogs following close behind me like always. We got to the bottom of the stairs, turned left and started down the hallway toward the dark living room when all of a sudden both dogs froze dead in their tracks on either side of me. I said, ""Come on, boys, let's go outside"" and patted my thigh three times, but they didn't budge. They looked paralyzed with fear, staring at something across the room. I followed their gaze and it led straight into the darkened far corner of the living room. It was too dark to see anything but I could feel a presence there in the shadows glaring back at me with an antagonistic and laser-like focus that sent chills down my spine. 

In a split second both dogs turned and bolted for the stairs, frantically running up the hard steps with everything they had, paws slipping, claws scratching and elbows knocking wood as they desperately tried to scramble back to the safety of the bedroom. I quickly flipped on the living room light and found myself staring straight into an empty corner. There was simply nothing there. 

As I prepared my lunch in the kitchen I could feel something standing an inch behind me. Staring blankly at the back of my head. Like the dead breath of some sort of corpse making the hair on my neck tingle. It was an unnerving feeling and I knew for the first time then and there that something definitely wasn't right. When I got back upstairs the dogs we're hiding under the bed shaking. They absolutely refused to budge. Whatever they had seen in the living room had really scared them. 

As time went on my wife began to experience terrifying sleep paralysis. My dog Milo, who normally awoke us growling, was now glued to her bedside at night. He refused to move. He would no longer even leave the bedside to go outside in the mornings. Maintaining his position and guarding her as she slept, even standing guard outside the door anytime she was in the bathroom. Despite all this, many nights she would awake in horror unable to move her body or speak in any way. 

At the time we did not fully attribute this to anything paranormal but it soon became clear that there was a presence in that house and it was focused directly on her. She started to get strange feelings like she was being peeked at from around corners or from dark rooms. Like someone staring, looking out at her from the corners with only the smallest portion of one eye from the darkened rooms of the house or the stairwell. It seemed to happen more when I was not there or when she was distracted. Seeing shadows move out of the corner of her eye. The dogs could often be seen barking and growling at something or someone just out of sight. Looking upward as if into the face of a person just around the corner. 

The paranormal activity intensified. I awoke to growling again one night as usual but suddenly my eyes shot open and I sat up realizing that it was not a familiar growl. It was not coming from the doorway or foot of the bed this time. In fact it was not a dog at all! It was clearly coming directly from the empty space between my wife's pillow and mine! It was unlike any dog growl. It was deep and demon-like. I knew something unseen was there. 

The next few days only brought worse. My wife filled the dogs' food bowls for breakfast and set the bowls down on the floor of the dining room. A moment later the bowl she had just set down flew across the room hitting the wall with a metallic crash as dog food rained down onto the hard tile floor and the bowl noisily whirled to its final resting place upside down. 

I was past the point of fear of it and well into anger at it. We'd close our eyes to go to sleep, it was standing over us like a dark shadow. We'd close our eyes to wash our faces, it was breathing down our necks. We'd close our eyes to wash our hair in the shower, it was peeking in from the edge of the curtain. We would be talking while doing random tasks such as washing our faces and we would hear a metallic-like voice mimic us from a foot away. 

""I'll turn on some warm water,"" I'd said one night getting ready for bed. A second later a robotic voice next to us simply said ""WARM WATER"". I had had it. ""Yeah yeah WARM WATER... Shut up"" I mocked it. 

This brought a new era of intensity. My wife was laying on the bed with the cat next to her when suddenly the cat stood us and went stiff, hair standing on end, the cat suddenly began freaking out and staring into the hall. She followed the cat's eyes and could see a large black mass come up the stairs, sort of roam around the hall and then enter the bathroom outside our bedroom door. We started hearing blaring voice phenomena, the decibel levels of which nothing in our house was even mildly capable of producing. It was louder than a concert speaker and sounded like a distressed male voice yelling frantically through static at the top of his lungs but we could never make out what he was saying. 

The first time we heard this we literally ran outside and looked out expecting the whole neighborhood to be outside their houses scratching their heads and looking puzzled into the sky like we were, but nobody else seemed to hear it at all. Not even our neighbors who shared a wall! Impossible! It was unbelievable! This happened many times over. My dogs would freak out at this sudden noise. The intensity of it would cause us to grit our teeth and squint our eyes as we would nearly jump out of our skin because it was so sudden and deafeningly loud. How were the windows not shattering? 

The insanity with Nicole's sleep paralysis was still occurring as well. I sat near her while she drifted off to sleep on the couch one night. The dogs were sleeping. The lights were on. Suddenly I felt that old familiar presence again. I snapped my eyes up and there stood a shadow figure with red eyes against the wall behind my wife. Rage shot from me and straight into its face as it crouched and darted into my dark laundry room. I had finally seen it! This entity was a coward and wanted to creep around at night and then scamper away in fear when confronted. 

The next morning I made a point to walk down stairs without turning on a light. ""It likes to hide in the shadows, well I'm going to confront it in the safety of its little shadows. I will give it no space to hide,"" I thought. I immediately sensed it hiding, crouching in the furthest corner of the dark living room. I could sense its gaze and I stared straight back hoping to see its cowardly face. It scampered again to the dark laundry room as I power-walked in and, for the last time ever, saw this black crouching figure against the far wall curled up with its knees to its chest sitting on the floor cowering and staring up at me as I were about to beat it.

""YOU ARE NOT WELCOME HERE. YOU ARE DEAD! NOW GET OUT!"" I said angrily with my stare burning a hole into it. I watched it sink backwards into the wall as if falling over the edge of a cliff. It did a backward somersault and was gone. 

After that we never saw it again. My wife's sleep paralysis finally stopped. Our life slowly returned to normal and the dogs calmed down with time. We no longer live there but I will never forget the strange and unexplained experiences of that house in Hawaii."
"The Old Farmhouse","Michigan","Haunted Places","This story takes place in a very old farm house where my best friend, Sassy, grew up. The house is still in her family but no one lives there full time. This house is on an old dirt road with an old red barn and sometimes a few of us will go out there for a bonfire or cookout. I had my son's graduation party there. 

The master bedroom is on the main floor and there are 2 more bedrooms upstairs. Tons of character! The basement, on the other hand, is pretty creepy. The furnace, washer and dryer are down there, along with an old heavy wooden door that's under the stairs. I've NEVER opened that door and don't plan to. My friend told me it's a room with a dirt floor and it's under the kitchen. Very creepy vibe!

I was down there one evening finishing up laundry. I was the only person in the house and a feeling came over me to get out of that basement. I've never felt that way before or since, but got the heck out of there.

One Sunday in the fall, Sassy and I were out at the farmhouse. She was cleaning inside and I worked outside. We were both inside when closing up the house and walked out together. 

The following Wednesday Sassy went back out to the house to check on some mail she thought she left. When she walked in she heard a strange noise coming from the master bedroom. At first, she thought it sounded like an air conditioning unit that was used in the summer time but it was sitting on the floor unplugged. Turns out, the sound was coming from a drawer in the vanity table. When she opened the drawer there was a blow dryer going off. It was very hot and could've burned down that house! Seriously, that was not on when we left the house 3 days before! This blow dryer was an older version. It didn't have a toggle switch but a sliding switch you could move up or down. My first thought was maybe a mouse got in that drawer and bumped it but that switch took more effort than a mouse could muster.

Sassy's husband will not spend the night in that house. He had a dream there was a dark figure standing at the top of the stairs and it's stayed with him for years. Other family members have heard strange sounds and Sassy's brother won't stay out there unless he has his gun with him. (Like he could shoot a ghost, LOL) 

Just a side note, Sassy's mom passed away in that house about 13 years ago. Her ashes are in a nice box up in the closet in the master bedroom. I don't think this is her at all but she never really liked Sassy's husband."
"Ghosts Come & Go","New Jersey","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","This is my 2nd posting. This is a common thing in the house and has taken place more often than not. Sitting in the living room, out of the peripheral of my eyes, I often see shadow figures that walk towards the front door of the house from the rear of the house. Also, they come in from the front door towards the rear of the house. 

I'm not the only one that sees this. My dog, for one, would pop his head up and follow the entity until it's out of his view, then he'd put his head down. Sometimes my mom would ask, ""What was that?"" to me and I'd respond to her, ""It was a ghost"". She sees it the same time I do and the dog which makes it legitimate. It seems it wasn't cars going by, it was debunked. My mom freaks out and doesn't like to talk about it. 

In my bedroom, where the ghosts love to play, I always keep a fan on while I sleep. I always have the fan on oscillate. One night in particular, I tried a totally different idea to see if whatever likes to visit me would like a new thing to do. I pulled the knob on the fan to stop the oscillating. As I laid in bed, I felt like I wasn't alone. I could hear my nightly visitor playing with my necklaces, pens and lighter as usual. All of a sudden, I heard the fan oscillating button slam down as with force of a living person. I guess my translucent friend didn't like change. Lol. 

I want to note that back in the late 1990s or early 2000s I bought a Ouija board from my local toy store, thinking it was cool. I never played with the board because I knew that those things can bring in some unwanted things, demons. My now-ex took it upon herself to play with my board on some occasions but outside the house (never inside). I don't believe that was the cause of all the great activity I've been experiencing since. All of this has been going on way before that, but it could have escalated it, maybe? The board has been gone for quite some time, the ex took it, which is good for me."
"The Wind Spoke","Wisconsin","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","First, I guess I want to draw attention to the fact that, like so many here, my life seems to have been peppered with the sort of nexus of strange events and experiences that are regarded as outside the ""norm.""

I actually have a theory about that, but I suppose that can wait. Second, I don't believe in ghosts. I know. I know. I'm writing this experience in a ghost forum of believers. I don't begrudge you your beliefs. I simply don't believe in lost spirits wandering the earth looking for a path to the light. That being said. It's been weird.

This particular event happened when I was 14 years old. My brother and I were sleeping in an abandoned house. Well, technically I suppose I was squatting but it was somewhere warm and my brother was spending the night that night. I can't remember why. Usually I spent the night there alone. 

I guess I do need to explain a little more about myself for this to make sense. I died when I was three years old. Obviously it didn't take, but my fragility meant I spent the first five or six years of my life in a medicated sort of daze. I saw a lot of things. I heard a lot of things. I decided by the time I hit the third grade that if someone else didn't see it or hear it with me, then it simply wasn't real. It got worse when I was ""drifting,"" which is what I call those moments when the physical slips away from you. When you're falling asleep, but not really sleeping, or when you completely zone out and miss your stop on the bus. That's drifting. 

So, this night it was around 2 am and I was well into my drifting. My brother, Mike, was laying on the floor next to my bed (only one bed) in one of the upstairs bedrooms. I started to hear something that sounded like words formed by the wind outside the window.

You have to understand, I'm not scared by the sounds. I'm drifting, and I'm sleepy, and I'm more curious in a vague sort of way because hearing music or voices in the drift isn't really that strange for me. But as I lay there listening, the voice seems to get a little clearer, until I could almost make out actual words. Then a voice, loud as a person standing in the center of the room, spoke my name. 

Ok. Here is the part you need to consider my past to understand. I still wasn't scared. I'd been hanging one arm off the bed and absently staring at my brother as I listened, and it wasn't the worst thing I'd ever heard but it was certainly new in its own way. But not really anything to get worked up about. Until Mike's eyes popped open and he went white as a sheet. 

At that point I still felt pretty relaxed, but started to get an uncomfortable sort of feeling in the pit of my stomach.

""Mike,"" I said, ""Did you hear something?""

Mike nodded, but didn't say anything.

So now I'm starting to become a little concerned, but I'm still reasonably sure everything is hallucination-ville voices generated but wind and a healthy drift. But...

""What did you hear?"" I asked.

Mike swallowed hard, looked right at me and whispered, ""Someone is calling your name.""

I considered that a moment, then said, ""You want to get the hell outta here?"" Mike nodded. I jumped out of bed and we wandered the streets until dawn.

Boys and girls, whatever you think, there is something in the wind. Believe it or don't. I don't know what it is. I lean towards demon but that's more of a theological choice. I don't know anything for sure. But I can feel it when it's there. I felt it tonight. That's why I started browsing for others with similar experiences and found this site. 

I still don't believe in ghosts. But it has been some kind of weird off and on all my life, and the wind seems to herald it or come with it or something. It happened so often I even named the damn thing when I was an angst-filled teen.

I called it Rerednaw. Wanderer spelled backwards. Corny? Yep. I was a kid, so cut me some slack.

Also, if I can offer a bit of personal experience advice. Don't talk to any of them. Don't fear any of them. And don't speak of them at night. All of these things draw their attention. Give them nothing. Ignore them if you can."
"Seeing My First Ghost/bonus Story","Washington","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","This happened to me when I was in middle school. I used to be scared of the paranormal/unknown so I never really dove into it when I was younger because it would keep me up at night. 

I remember being scared to shower with the door closed if nobody was home. This day I was home alone. I turned on the water and jumped into the shower. It was still daylight, my mom and stepdad weren't home from work, my siblings either were in sports or with friends. 

My shower is downstairs. If you are in the shower and turn your head to the right, the toilet, sink, mirror and door are right there. Suddenly I got this urge to look towards the right, towards the open door when I saw a half body apparition from the shoulders up. She had tight blonde curls and blood all over her face. I just stared at her, wide-eyed, not knowing how to react. We made eye contact and then she stuck her tongue out at me and disappeared. I was so shaken I jumped out of the shower, dried off and ran upstairs. I never saw her again and that was just the beginning. 

I used to sleep with my cat every night. I was scared of sleeping alone and he would bring me comfort and soothe me. One night everyone was getting ready for bed when I left my room to go downstairs to get my cat. I picked him up, heading back up the stairs. I never liked using the bathroom upstairs. All my sibilings used it but it always had this weird feeling to me. 

The light in the hallway was on, so was the bathroom light. I got this tingle that started in the back of my neck that shot to the rest of my body. I got this feeling I needed to look into the bathroom. When I did, I saw an apparition of a teenage girl who looked like me: skinny, tall and sandy blonde hair but her eyes were blue, mine are hazel. She was wearing a grey sweatshirt, blue jeans and her hair was in a ponytail. She leaned over like she was picking up something she dropped. When she saw me she was shocked, like I caught her off guard. She looked surprised and then disappeared very fast. All that was left was a faint white mist."
"Our New Scary House Part 2","Oregon","Haunted Places","As time went on I realized we were living in a haunted house. It started becoming more than items being moved around from one room to another, or things disappearing and reappearing again. Now whatever was in the house became focused on my jewelry box. I would open it to get a necklace I have hanging inside and see them all tangled together. I would wonder how they all got that way? So I'd take them all out and patiently untangle them. I don't wear my necklaces every day. Sometimes weeks would go by before I'd wear one. I'd open my jewelry box and they'd be all tangled up in knots again?! It would take me over an hour to untangle them! What's strange is I'd notice certain knots in the chains, they were deliberate as if someone took their time to do it. 

Mr. C and I began to fight a lot and we never did before. He couldn't see what I did. One day after months of untangling knots in my necklaces I just brought the whole jewelry box out to show him, he knew I had just untangled them a few weeks ago! I asked him HOW was it happening? He started taking my chains out and seeing how they were in knots. I yelled at him saying it wasn't natural and that he knows it isn't! He spent over an hour unraveling my gold and silver chains, one was tangled so badly it broke. He finally agreed that it WAS strange and he just didn't know what to say. At least he was starting to see what I did.

Then I went to one of my trinket boxes to get a pretty lapel pin to wear on my blouse. They had all been unfastened with the pin sticking straight up?! I always close the pins so I won't get stuck from them. I took them out and closed them. Days later I went back and they were all opened with the pins sticking straight up in the air again! If I were to put my hand in without looking I could easily have injured myself. I sat on the edge of the bed and yelled out ""WHO'S HERE?!"" I began to cry and felt a heavy weight around me. I started to get depressed living in that house. Mr. C and I fought all the time now. I KNEW we had to get out of there, the house was tearing us apart and making me sick.

We finally found a place and it was a blessing to be leaving. As I mentioned in ""Part 1"" of this story (Editor's addition: https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=26858), I like to mark my boxes so I know what goes in which room. When I opened them up in our new house nothing was in the boxes as marked, and some of the boxes where half empty?!

 A few weeks later I was kneeling at the bathtub cleaning it when something scratched me just above my ankle. I immediately stopped to look at it. It was throbbing with pain and also this intense itching. Later on I had two scratches on the front of my neck. I knew I had been followed to our new house and was scared. 

I have a girlfriend that had been in Afghanistan at the time of these happenings. She was home now and had a friend that did paranormal investigations. I called her to do one and man oh man, did we get the scare of our lives! I don't know what's here or why it follows me, I just keep trying to deal with it by praying. I have smudged a few times before, but it didn't work."
"Paw Prints From Heaven","Florida","Pets / Animals","In 2008 my beloved Pomeranian dog, Angel passed away. She was 11 and had cancer. She went very peacefully with no apparent pain. She was the sweetest Pomeranian. She was a pretty cream color, very beautiful dog inside and out. When she passed the vet took a paw print impression of her paw and put it on a special ornament keepsake. The vet did this for all pet owners when they passed as a gift to their clients. I kept the ornament and still have it today. I remember looking at the cast impression and thinking, wow I never really studied her paw before and I made a mental impression in my mind of her paw print. I guess in a way dogs all have different looking paws to some degree. I never really gave it much thought until I saw that impression of her paw on the ornament. 

I had Angel cremated and and a couple of weeks later I took her ashes to Florida (I lived in Michigan at the time). I used to like to take Angel to the beach in Florida. There was a place she loved to walk on the beach so I spread her ashes there. Although I really missed my dog because I loved her dearly, by spreading her ashes on the beach it brought me closure and I felt at peace with her passing. 

When I returned home to Michigan after spreading her ashes, Michigan had a snowstorm and fresh snow covered everything. I lived in a small apartment on the second floor in downtown Northville. I remember admiring how pretty the snow looked because it was untouched and fresh looking since it was freshly fallen even though I'm not particularly fond of snow, but it looked pretty and freshly white. I parked my car in the parking lot and approached the stairway to my second floor unit. There were two units to the second floor, mine and one that had been vacant for awhile. Only one staircase which was the only exit/entrance to the second floor. Everything was covered in fresh snow including the stairway to my apartment and as I approached the stairway I noticed a single set of paw prints going up the stairway. None coming down, just going up and no other foot prints or markings of any kind in the fresh snow and I remember thinking immediately that they looked like my dog, Angel's paw prints. The only explanation I could think of why there were paw prints going up but not down was a sign Angel is with me. She came home and apparently made it home from Florida before I did.:) 

I guess everyone can come to their own conclusion for the paw prints on the stairway but there really was no explanation of why there was paw prints going up the stairway and not going down and no people prints and no animals were up in my apartment or anywhere on the staircase. The prints did look like the paw print of Angels on the ornament-

I've had many dogs in my life and have been saddened by their Passing. I miss all of them but this was the only unusual after death experience I've had with a dog. It gave me peace in knowing they are still with us after death. It was a beautiful way for Angel to let me know that. I hope my true story helps bring peace out other pet owners as well who miss their pets. I believe they are still with us and perhaps when we die, we all walk to the pearly gates together. That's what I'd like to think.:]"
"Grim Reaper In The Nursing Home","Maryland","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","This happened about 7 or 8 years ago, I can't really recall the exact time but it has been a very long time already. 

I was working on this Nursing Home back when I still live in Baltimore, Maryland. I was a new Nurse back then and I was stationed at this skilled unit they called the Vent Unit. Now the patients or residents that stays here looked like they are in critical condition with their ventilators attached to their trachea and Peg tubes attached to their feeding pumps but they are actually on stable condition enough for them to be placed on our unit. 

Our unit is like a cross road, I don't know how to describe it well but I'll try. The nurse's station is in the middle and shaped like circular where you can see the north, south, east, and west hallways leading to other units. The north hallway has a dead end that leads to a wall at the far end and nowhere else to go. That side of the hallway always creeps me out especially during the night shift where I always work.

One night, it was past midnight already and the lights were dimmed but the north hallway was particularly darker than the rest probably because it is a dead end. I was doing my chart checks when at the corner of my eye I saw a very tall shadow that just glided towards a resident's room. I was facing the East wing that time because I didn't want to be facing on the dark hallway and still that didn't spare me from witnessing something unusual.

I shrugged it off as my imagination but I can really feel something different that time. Anyway since it is my duty to do rounds to make sure my patients are ok, I went to the North hallway and checked on my patients and nope I didn't see anything unusual or any tall shadows, so I went to do what my duties needed me to do that night.

Fast forward the next day, as I come in for my shift that night and I was getting report, I was surprised that the endorsing nurse told me that the patient in room such and so passed away that morning. I immediately recalled the tall shadowy figure that I saw out of the corner of my eye that went through that side of the hallway rooms at the far end. I wasn't particularly sure which room but I knew it was near the resident that passed away. Again I passed it off as a coincidence. 

A few months after something happened that scared the crap out of me while working there. As I was passing meds past midnight for some scheduled meds on my patients. I was again on the North Hallway and it was pretty dim and everything is quiet except for some occasional dings and alarms of some vents but nothing unusual. 

As I entered on this particular room, it was pretty dark since the lights are off in the room but there are dim lights on the hallway behind me. Now the rooms have these wide windows and usually they are covered at night by curtains or blinds but on this particular room it was wide open. I can't see what's outside since it's pitch black outside but the window served as a mirror since I can see my reflection, and the reflection of the hallway behind me when I enter the room. 

This gives me the creeps until today and I remember when I entered the room I felt like there was something behind me. You know that feeling like when you are being watched and you feel your hairs behind your neck standing up with that prickly sensation all over your body as your heart starts to raise and pound faster. That's what I felt and what made it worse was when I was trying to search for the room's light switch, I roamed my eyes all over the room while feeling with my hand on the wall for the switch when my eyes landed on the reflection of the window where I saw a tall shadowy figure standing just behind me. My heart literally skipped a beat and as soon as I felt the switch I turned it on and the figure is gone from the reflection on the window. 

I was so freaked out that I never said a word that shift and just did my work to occupy my mind. Even my coworker asked if I was ok but I just showed them I was even if inside my mind I wasn't.

The next day as I come back for work, I heard the terrible news that the patient died that morning, where I saw the shadowy figure.

I don't know for sure if they were grim reapers or death but that was one of my unforgettable moments that I'll remember when I was working on that place. Thank you for reading."
"The Red Eyed Shadow","Mississippi","Haunted Places","This is my fist, paranormal experience. I was a firm sceptic and believed after we died it's over.

It all began when I was ten. My family and I moved from Indiana to be closer to my mother's family. We live roughly half a block away from them. I will be fast forwarding to the later years as well.

When we first moved in, I had a bad feeling due to several things only I seemed to pick up on. 

This is a one story, four bedroom, two bath home. Anytime I'd walk from my room to the kitchen I'd get this feeling like my instincts saying run somethings behind you. Also, I kept a feeling of nausea anytime I was in the hall bathroom.

My family and I began hearing noises. This was a fairly old home built in the early to late '60s. We assumed it was an animal so my father called an exterminator. The exterminator said there's no vermin in there, not even a nook or cranny they could get in through. 

The noises continued. 

After that things escalated. Things would disappear only to reappear in the hall bath in the sink cabinet. Needless to say, my parents blamed us and they seemed to change. They were both very loving but now they'd fight over the smaller details.

My little sister began hearing growling in her bedroom and what sounded like pacing at night. I began hearing knocking on my window at night. Not a frenzied knock, more like a steady ""let me in"" knock. I assumed it was other kids pranking me. 

One night I was in a foul mood, can't remember why exactly, but for the first time I opened the curtains and no one was there. It takes two seconds to get to my window from my bed. I was shocked, to say the least. I told my parents and they said I was imagining things. 

Things got worse after that. My sister would wake up screaming that a shadow was after her. My parents passed it off as a normal nightmare. She still has that nightmare to this day.

This is where I skip a head a few years. I was 16, my parents had divorced 3 years prior. I was working out in my room lifting barbells, it's about 8 at night. The tapping had stopped stopped after I opened the curtains when I was 10. It suddenly began again. I opened them again nothing there.

At this time my sister was 11. She still had the nightmare and she and I had both began being scratched. If it was once in a while it'd be nothing but this was nightly and we began getting what looked like 2 hole bite marks. The marks were roughly human canine size bite marks.

I spoke to the grandaughter of the family we purchased the house from they did not have any paranormal activity while living there. However, she had told me when her aunt was 16 she had taken her own life in the hall bathroom by drinking a large amount of rat poison mixed with juice. 

I talked to friend who was into the paranormal. He said take sage and burn it get the smoke in every corner of the house. I did as instructed and everything stopped for 2 months but I think it angered this entity because it came back worse.

Two months after the saging my sister began seeing the shadow out of her dreams and so did I. This entity as best as I can describe looked like an old cowboy silhouette cut out hat, and all but wearing a trench coat with glowing red eyes. We are still experiencing this creature to this day. 

I've since married and moved out but my mother and sister still reside in the home. How can we get rid of this entity and do they have to move?"
"Weird Encounters?","Illinois","Haunted Places","I have had many of weird encounters and experiences. 

Story #1

Recently my family moved out of a townhouse we lived in for a few years, partly because of the experiences we had. I want to know what you can understand from these experiences we had. 

1) This is a funny one. I have a great-grandfather named Itshe, and we own a book in memory of him with his name on the cover. As a joke one night at dinner I said his name is Shite, but jumbled up. And then the book fell off the shelf. Very weird and creepy. 

2) FOOTSTEPS! Very often would hear footsteps when no one is even home. At times I thought it was my cat, but then I would turn to see my cat is sitting with me. 

3) Around this time my brother was a baby, so we had baby monitors that would pick up very weird noises. He would stay in my room in an opened closet. But this closet has a very weird and dark vibe to it, the attic entrance is right above it, and we never opened it once. The baby monitor would pick up many voices, almost as if someone was singing to the baby. 

4) The basement has ALWAYS had an eerie vibe. My sister and I would both be downstairs sometimes at night, and we would hear a drumming noise come from the storage area of the basement. We know people in the area, no one has a drum set that plays at 1 AM. We experienced this multiple times. It sounds almost like Jumanji lol. 

5) MY ROOM! I have a feeling that closet is a hot spot for something. I saw MANY dark shadows walk by that closet. There were even times where I had woken up with random scratches. Or like something is hovering over me and I would wake up to a chill. My room was always cold. Any explanations?

Story #2

We are in my new house that we live in now. I decided for fun when I was home alone one day to ""communicate"" with a spirit. I didn't really think I had one in the house. I asked what their name is, and when I listened back on the audio I heard a very faint female voice saying my name. Ever since that I had been having experiences almost instantly. 

1) The next night I am in bed and I have to go to the bathroom. The bathroom is in the basement located right next to my room. As I open the door, I see that the sink is on and running. The knobs for the sink are turned off and there is literally no explanation in the moment to explain why that happened. 

2) I managed to get the water to stop running and I begin to feel chills and my hair is sticking up. That rarely happens.

3) I walk back to my room to see a nice sized black spider hanging over my bed on a string. I don't know if that has to do with anything paranormal, but that is quite a coincidence."
"23 Minutes Flatline And I Hear Her Voice","Nebraska","Psychic / Medium","I am typing this at 6:58 PM October 5, 2019. This is a real time, evolving event. I will try to be coherent and cohesive, but realize I am not in the best head space at the moment.

My mother-in-law has had several strokes that put her daily care beyond our scope. She resides at a skilled nursing facility. In the last two weeks she has been admitted to the ICU three times now.

First time, UTI that went septic. She went unresponsive. She was in ICU for a week, then moved to the floor for 2 days, sent back to the facility, and the next day was found unresponsive. Back to Hospital.

Second time, one day after being discharged, admitted back into ICU for pneumonia. This was NOT a surprise, I argued until I was hoarse about her being discharged the day before because I had been told by a doctor - whom I never saw again - that she had pneumonia. Her hospitalist told me that he didn't know any doctor by that name, and that he didn't see any pneumonia. Eh... So he discharged her again, on Thursday the 3rd. 

Friday the 4th and 1:08 PM my hubby called me and told me to get to the care facility NOW. She was unresponsive, had a pulse in the 30's and blood pressure of 60/30. She has Do Not Intubate instructions. I told Jerry to have them call the ambulance, I'll be there in 10 minutes.

This is background. It hasn't gotten paranormal yet. When I arrived it felt surreal, like I had stepped out of time. People seemed to be moving slowly. I wasn't running or even hurrying, but it was like I passed them in a blur. I beat the ambulance there by several minutes.

I tried talking to her - no response. Her eyes were locked and staring, her pupils pinpricks. I swear she looked terrified. The people there told me that she wasn't aware. I beg to differ, but I digress.

The ambulance did arrive and I went to my car, ready to follow. I still had that surreal feeling, like I was a step out of time but I was calming down. My hubby followed me out and kept asking if I was okay. I was but I couldn't understand why he was talking to me when his mom was being loaded on the ambulance. He went to get into my car and I heard, clear as a bell and loud as a clarion - my mother-in-law's voice, ""Jerry has to come with me."" I didn't even question it. I simply told him to ride with his mother, she can't be alone right now.

He went. She coded 3 minutes into the 15 minute drive to the hospital. They started chest compressions but did not stop to give oxygen. At the ER they put her on a thumper and started bagging her. After another ten minutes they were ready to call Time of Death. I stepped out of the curtain after my husband practically ran out of the room. 

To the right of me, just above me I heard my mother-in-law's voice again. Sharp and urgent, she called to Jerry. I used that exact tone and told him ""Can't you hear her? She's calling you, get back in there.""

The pastor was in the hall, with my son and several milling staff. Each and every one of them turned to look at me like I needed the guy's with the butterfly nets. I grabbed Jerry and dragged him in there, right to her bed, and I reached out to stroke her cheek. Before I could touch her, the monitor that had only shown chest compression rhythm for over 10 minutes started beeping and moving. Her heart started beating on its own. The staff went from wind down care to rescue in a heartbeat. The doctor asked for more epinephrine and the nurse who had stopped bagging her started bagging her again.

According to everyone there, she was not breathing on her own. I disagreed. I could SEE her trying. I could see her coming back from wherever she went. SHE WAS TRYING. Nobody listened for several minutes. The doctor said they can't intubate, as it is against her advance directives and she will die. I knew she was trying... I knew it. So I asked them to put the bi-pap on her. It is a positive pressure type device that if there is any kind of activity it will pump air - but there must be activity. The doctor said it wouldn't work, but he humored me.

Not only did it work, she was breathing with oxygen sats between 96 and 100. Please do not think that this is me bragging or taking credit. I am VERY aware that I was being used as a conduit. I am humbled to be trusted with that role. 

Since then, the last 24 hours, I have 'known' things that had to be done, guided by knowledge not my own, on keeping her safe and alive. Right now, she is awake, conscious, fully in charge of her faculties, eating and drinking with minimal assistance. I attribute that to the guidance I've received.

I don't know what the plan is that creation has for her, but I know it's my place to do all I can for her. Why else put me in the position to hear her voice while she was flatline over 20 minutes?

She is not out of the woods, not by a long shot, but she is still here, and now I'm not the only one hearing her voice. Did I mention her nickname is Loud One?"
"Little Girl In White At Little Caesar's Pizza Place","Virginia","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I was searching for more stories like this, just had same issue with my 18 year old son. 

I went to pick him up from work and he told me of a little girl in white coming past the counter where only employees go. He said that NO ONE else noticed her but him because he looked at everyone (it was busy and dangerous area for a child). He said he didn't say anything to her. She was looking at others (he noticed her but she didn't notice him, he said she looked very strange). He turned around and went to work, then looked again and she was gone. 

Later that night he was taken to ER at 3am (Devil's Hour) due to him and 3 others going off a embankment. They could have all died. He was the only one without a seltbelt on and got a chest contusion due to the car rolling down a mountain. 

We thank God they are okay, but I still believe it had something to do with him being defiant. (Sunday Sep., 8th I warned him that evil wanted him dead and his Grandmother so happened to take his baby picture she had on her piano in her living room at her home to Sunday service that morning to pray over him.) Based on all other stories I feel little girl in white was a warning! 

2 Corinthians 11:14 And no Marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of Light. 

We come from a very Godly and spiritual family and hope and pray that this can help others. In my son's situation, I believe we have to take accountability for our actions for he had received numerous warnings. Thank you for letting me share!"
"Where Time Stood Still","Idaho","Haunted Places","Let me begin by giving you a picturesque vision of the house where it seemed as though time had stood still. 

The year was 2005, and we had found a very charming older house in the historic part of downtown Pocatello, Idaho. I was really drawn to this place because of it's 1940's - 1950's feel. It had all the original carpeting and wallpaper from that time period. It even had the original stove (which proved to be more inconvenient when it came to baking, due to the very small oven space). 

I recall, while looking through each of the bedrooms, hanging up on the inside of closet doors was an album insert of Perry Como. You know something that a young teenage girl would do if it were her bedroom. It was one of his early albums.

I asked the realtor what the story of the house was, why it seemed as though no one had lived in it since the 1950's. The realtor stated that an elderly woman had lived in it since the 40's, she had raised her daughter there and then passed away a year prior to it being available for rent. 

This information intrigued me and I fell in love with the place. We moved right in. I decided to take the ""Perry Como"" room as my own and left his picture right where it sat. 

Immediately after moving in problems with the house started happening right and left. Things like the bathroom flooding, the kitchen flooding, the toilet quit working. We had plumbing companies come in each time and fix whatever the problem was, just to have something else go wrong. The stove even quit working.

On one of the first nights in the house I was laying in my bed, it was late at night with the television buzzing in the background. I had started to nod off, when I was instantly jolted wide awake by something heavy slamming on the floor at the foot of my bed. I didn't know what it was or why it had happened, but I got the feeling that someone did not agree with my falling asleep with the television still on. After that night I made a point to always shut off the tv before I fell asleep.

In between mine and my kids room was a small hallway and I had set a little lamp on a table in it for them in case they had to get up in the middle of the night. On a few occasions I would hear movement outside my door in that hallway and, thinking it was one of the boys getting up to use the restroom, I would lay there looking at my bedroom door, waiting for them to come get me up asking to be tucked in. The door had a small space at the bottom and a skeleton key hole, which allowed me to actually see that someone was infact walking around in the hallway. When I would get up to check on them, they were always sound asleep.

I had made a sort of painting nook down in one of the corners of the unfinished basement. I swear that I was never alone down there. It was so bad that I just quit going down there all together.

I started to notice that I always felt ill, as if I had the flu or something. Oddly enough whenever I got out of the house for a little while, I would feel perfectly fine. I also noticed that my ex-husband and I were always arguing and I never knew why, but we seemed to be so angry with each other for no reason. 

We only lived there for probably 3 months, otherwise who knows what more would have happened. I strongly feel that the elderly lady decided that was HER home and was pretty set in her ways and was not very welcoming to outsiders."
"Ghostly Coincidence?","Texas","Family / Friends Visits","Back in 2010, my parents were living with me until they could find a place of their own. I was selling my house at the time and, unfortunately, my dad passed away so my mom and I got an apartment together. It was a cute 2 bedroom/2 bath and had a laundry room off the kitchen. 

About a month after moving in, my mom went away for the weekend and I had the place to myself. I was doing laundry and when I went to switch it I noticed my mom's lamp was on. I wasn't 100% sure it wasn't on earlier because it was still light outside. This lamp was a touch lamp and I've heard they can be fickle. I turned it off and checked to make sure the bulb was tight and went on with laundry.

Later, when I went back to switch laundry the lamp was on again! This time I was a bit unnerved but turned it off and went on with my evening. It didn't turn on again that night and I checked the next day when I woke up. 

When mom got home I nonchalantly asked her if she'd had any trouble with the lamp in her room and she said no. I didn't make a big deal about it because she would've scoffed at me. 

Another month goes by and my mom goes away for the weekend. I'm at home doing laundry and it happens again! Just like the last time. It totally gave me chill bumps and I really wanted to believe it was my dad saying hello. He died suddenly and we didn't get to say goodbye. 

On a side note to this story, I didn't automatically think this was paranormal because it could be explained since the lamp was a touch one so I asked my brother in law, who is a master electrician, to inspect the lamp and the outlet it was plugged into. He did not find anything wrong at all and I never had any more trouble with that lamp. 

A few months later, my mom moved out and my son moved in. She left that lamp and it was in my son's room. One morning I woke up to find the lamp sitting on the dining room table. My son explained it had turned on in the middle of the night and he didn't want it in his room. Lol

Not sure where that lamp ended up but I honestly don't feel it was a coincidence. I really want to believe it was my dad letting me know he was around."
"New Home, New Happenings","Oklahoma","A Haunted Life","We have recently moved into another home. The last one ended up having a huge bug infestation that we couldn't get rid of. During the summer it happened to get extremely warm, which meant A/C running on auto. So it was nice and cool once the A/C was halfway fixed which, in return, allowed these particular insects to come out and feed on us. So we left everything behind and moved. 

The owners allowed us to break the lease, because they failed to inform us the previous tenants brought those in. They had failed to get rid of them successfully.

Now onto the new one. This house is much bigger than the last. Four bedrooms, huge living room, the washer and dryer in the same room. I'm laughing at myself for being so excited about that, simply because the former place had the washing machine in the bathroom and the dryer downstairs. Lots of work for a weeks worth of clothes to wash.

I don't allow myself to smoke inside the house, so my usual spots are either outside on the front porch, or stand just outside of the back door which is in the laundry room and connected to the master bedroom. (In order to get to that backdoor, I have to walk through my bedroom through one door and walk through the laundry room.) I can see directly into my room from the laundry room.

One evening I had decided I was going to sneak a smoke before bed. I was standing in the laundry room facing the backyard (my back towards the bedroom) when I felt what I thought was my oldest son walk up behind me. I feel their energies, all of them are different which is why I say my oldest son's. But within that second it took me to turn around, I realized he hadn't said anything to make his presence known. His normal thing to say is mother in an English style accent. 

I turned around and didn't see him, but did catch a glimpse of a shorter shadow run from one side of the door to the other. So I quickly realized it wasn't my son and ran towards the bedroom and look towards the direction this shadow was running to. And of course nothing absolutely nothing. This particular thing has happened twice already.

The second time it happened in the kitchen while I was washing the dishes. Now we have a huge mirror in front of our sink, and that time I didn't see anything just felt it come right up behind me. 

Our thermostat is constantly being turned down from 75 to 70. We set it to 70 during the evening so we can sleep good and 75 in the afternoon while we're all away. We return home to it freezing in the house so we check the thermostat and it will be at 70 again. I know that's not cold, but when the house has been closed up and curtains drawn all day, it tends to get cold. 

The TV turns itself off at night. Only time it does that is when I decide to sleep in the living room when my back and neck have been acting up. My mattress is brand spanking new and I can't sleep on it half the time. 

I have gotten a huge bang at the door, and the jiggling of the door handle so my husband asks who is it and looks out the front window. He saw no one standing there so he opens it up and looks out the through screen door. It's still locked so there was no possible way our door could have jiggled without someone yanking and prying the screen door open. And believe me, we would have heard that. 

I told him (with my beliefs and experiences) not to open that door. If you see no one, leave it be. But he tends to get that wave of (protect and see what I'm up against) type energy flowing and didn't listen. 

Thus all of the above happening after the knock at the door.

Thank you all for taking the time to read this.

"The Hissing Tiger","Oregon","Haunted Items","I was taking the trash out one day. There's a strip of bushes on the side of the house with rocks. As I stepped on the rocks I looked down and noticed this earring laying there and picked it up. It was mine and I thought it so odd that it was outside like that. I tossed it in the trash and went in the house not thinking about it again. 

I was going somewhere special and was looking in my jewelry box for something to wear when I noticed the other earring to the one I tossed in the trash days earlier, what are the odds of that?! That was when I first remembered losing the other one, it was five years ago! I've walked in that same spot at least a thousand times if not more since then. There aren't that many rocks there for it to have been covered up all that time. I had recently moved from a haunted house and thought it was all behind me.

Then I remembered something... I found that earring at my back door years earlier and threw it away, how am I finding it again?! It reminded me of the haunted house we lived in a few years earlier. 

When my mother had passed away my sister had 4 pieces of jewelry of hers that were silver and looked like tigers, one had orange strips. She asked if I wanted one so I picked the one with the orange stripes. They are one of a kind pieces brought over from Thailand by my nephew. 

One night I went in my room to put something on my dresser when I saw all 4 of those tigers laying there. I was floored! How could that be? I only had ONE and didn't even like the others. I picked them all up staring at them in shock. I laid them back on my dresser. The next morning all of them where gone except the one with the raised back, as if it were hissing. 

I'd like to add at this point that I never got along with my mother, we had a tumultuous relationship to say the least. She died in a nursing home the same year of this happening."
"Little Miss Tauri","Oklahoma","Pets / Animals","First I want to apologize for being absent from this site. For years this was like a second home. Hopefully it will be again.

I will start from the beginning. I had begun to really want a female companion for my baby Tuck. He's a Mastiff/Pitt mix and quite big and I had noticed he looked lonely while playing in the backyard.

I had, for awhile, been talking my hubby into it, as he was reluctant to have another puppy in the house. Which meant nonstop potty training, bathing, cleaning up accidents, getting a crate, etc.

I had idea where I was going to get this puppy, and had kind of forgotten all about it. But a buddy of my husband's that he hangs out with from time to time brought up that his female Blue Nose Pitt had a litter. He told me about it, but something told me no, so I said no, trusting my gut.

His cousin happened to buy one of these puppies, and had her for about a month and mentioned to my hubby while hanging out that he was thinking about getting rid of her.

So when he told me about this my first questions were important. I asked ""Did she get her first 2 rounds of shots?"" ""Has she been dewormed?"" etc. If it were an option for me at all those were some of the most important questions to ask. We are in a new home. My Tuck is almost 3 so truly there is no way, as far as I know, to know if there is Parvo, etc in my yard. 

He told me the guy whom his cousin bought the puppy from had given her her shots and dewormed her. We talked about it and decided if he were to give her up, I would take her in and love her!

One day his cousin told us to come get her, he was ready. So we get there, walk into the house and out of all the people in this house (it's an active household, always a ton of people there) as I walk in behind everyone she spots me and runs right to me. 

I asked ""Is this her?"" The wife said ""yes"" and I instantly fell in love. She had the prettiest blue/green eyes, softest gray fur and she was in need of love. I felt it. But then the wife said to her husband she couldn't get rid of her because of the grandkids. 

Now don't get me wrong, I understood where she was coming from, but it killed me on the inside. All I wanted to do was take her in my arms and cuddle with her.

Anyhow we end getting her and bringing her home. She had an instant connection with everyone in the house. She was completely loved by all of us. We loved her cuddles, kisses, her running to us when we got home, learning new things we were teaching her, etc. We all were excited everyday to come home and play with her. 

Then she got sick. She caught the Parvo Virus and the vets couldn't save her. It was sudden and quick. It killed all of us and we're still dealing with her passing.

The night she passed I decided to lay down, I couldn't take the emotions that were running through me. And I talked to her. I told her ""Tauri, you are always welcome back in our home for cuddles and kisses.""

I didn't get a visitation but my son did. He was the closest with her. He was her human. 

The next day while at work he texted me. He told me he'd had a dream of her and would tell me once I got home. My excitement was so high as well as my emotions. I would start crying while working. I couldn't hold it in. 

Once I got home I told him to come outside and tell me. He told me in his dream he was laying down and crying. Then Tauri pushed the door open like she had learned to do, ran to his bed and jumped up there. She started to give him kisses and curled up next him and fell asleep. He then woke up and felt his face, it was wet in the spot she had given him kisses.

That same day we were all sitting in the front porch, showing each other videos and pictures of her. How she had grown so much in the 3 months we had her. I looked over and there in the spot she would play with the water was sitting a little baby butterfly. It sat there for a good 30 minutes before we all got up and went inside. 

Now anytime we talk about her there will be a random butterfly that seems to have excellent timing floating right on by."
"The Man Who Caught Me","Oregon","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","This happened October of 2012 in Salem, Oregon. I was twelve at the time and in middle school. It was Halloween, school just got out and I went to a friend's house to put on costumes and prepare for the night. I didn't need makeup for my costume. I just wore a witches hat and cape. So I decided to go and play on the swing in the backyard. 

Before I went outside their parents left to go pick up dinner and told us they would be back sometime soon. My two friends with me went to go get ready shortly after that. Then I was left alone outside. 

I went to go sit on the swing. It was getting cold and the sun was close to setting. As I began to swing it got really quiet. Almost eerily quiet. This went on for about 20 minutes or so. I could only hear the wind passing through the leaves of the trees, and the occasional bird, which was odd. Even though they lived near the woods there were still quite a few people in the surrounding area. It was so quiet and peaceful that I started to slip and fall back. 

As I fell I felt strong hands on my back push me back up onto the swing, and then a hand patted my shoulder. I glanced over looking for the force behind the sudden touch. It was large, and seemed to be worn out. I said thank you. Then a man replied. He sounded old and almost a little raspy. He told me to be more cautious and aware of my surroundings. 

I turned to say something more and he was gone. I stood up and looked around. To my surprise no one was there. Then I looked to my left towards the garage. I assumed it was my friend's father, that he had passed by as it happened then caught me on his way to work on his car. 

I walked into the garage and it was empty. Lights were off as well. I then checked the back gate. It was locked. Unable to be unlocked, or even locked for that matter from the other side. I decided to go back into the house to see if my friends were done. 

I went to the bathroom and asked if their parents were back. She told me no, they haven't come back yet, might not be for awhile. I began to tell them about how a man caught me on the swing. 

We went and searched around outside and there was no evidence of someone getting into the backyard. They told me to stop playing around, and to just go back inside. I swore up and down I wasn't lying. I told only the truth. They got fed up with me and went back inside the house. 

I still think about that night. Remember the hands catching me, the voice, and even the footsteps fading away. To this day neither of them believe me. Not many others I tell do either."
"The Pressure","Alabama","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","Two nights ago, I had an encounter. As I was dozing off, I started feeling pressure on my legs. I went to move them and it felt as if someone was sitting on them. I could barely move them without struggling. It made me wide awake by now but I refused to open my eyes after my previous encounter with a negative entity (previous stories). It felt like my eyes wanted to open without my control but I kept them shut tight.

I was so focused by now, I started to feel the weight on my stomach and started feeling tingly (vibrations) on my face at the same time. I was laying on my back with my left hand by my side and my right hand, laying flat on my stomach. By then I was starting to get scared, I don't know who this visitor was. Like I would know who it was anyways.

While I was feeling vibrations on my face, I started to feel so much pressure. Like a hand pushing my face down. The left side of my face, to be exact. It started to hurt, and it might sound weird but it even felt like half my face wasn't there, just pressure. Same with part of my body. One night maybe about 3 years ago, I woke up in the middle of the night with a feeling of something trying to consume me or ""possess"". It felt like that with this encounter too, the feeling was there but I don't know if that was the case.

I usually twitch when falling asleep so I thought I was twitching when my pointy finger on my right hand that was laying on my stomach was moving. The way it moved though. It wasn't a twitch. Something was lifting my finger and dropping it back on my stomach. When I realized that, I was thinking is this really happening? Is something playing with my finger? It happened about 3, 4 times and after that, the feeling in my face was starting to be unbearable. It was like a ache or something squeezing the left side of my face. I ended up grabbing my pillow to cover my face and moved my whole entire body to get the feeling away. It worked, I didn't feel pressure on my face anymore nor on my legs or stomach. So I laid on my stomach and was able to fall asleep.

Tonight, my son told me something moved his pillow. He also has been having nightmares lately. Is it messing with us? Is it the same entity as before trying to scare my son? I don't want ANYTHING to mess with my baby. And if he's starting to experience the paranormal, my heart will break. His little heart doesn't deserve to know the fear of the other side. When I was younger it was so hard to deal with and that was when I was in my teen years. He's only just about to turn 6.

I did smoke marijuana that night and every time I smoke it seems like I have encounters. I have read up on doing drugs would put holes in your Aura and also make it easier for paranormal beings to possess or have an encounter with them. I know, if I want it to stop, I need to stop smoking but there are so many things that could put holes in your Aura. Cigarettes, bad food, alcohol, drugs and so on. But marijuana is the only thing that helps with sleep, hunger, headaches etc for me.

Sometimes, I just wish I wouldn't have any encounters. It's overwhelming and scary. To know something is there watching you and you don't even know it.

Any input is greatly appreciated. I might not find answers but knowing someone is there reading and giving me advice helps a bunch."
"Poltergeist? Demon? Scared","Alabama","Haunted Places","My daughter lives in Leighton, Alabama by the old LaGrange College Site. She, her husband and 4 kids live there. They have a blended family. The kids are ages 2, 5, 6, and 8. The two youngest are girls and are hers. The two oldest are boys and are her husband's. 

Her husband has seen on many occasions a lady and a small boy in dated clothing. Also a very scary looking man. When the youngest boy was three he was slapped in the back and had a ""giant"" handprint. He has had a couple more encounters. I have heard a woman humming a lullaby to the youngest girl. Kitchen cabinets and bedroom doors have slammed shut. 

Most recently was last night. My daughter video called me and was hysterical. She heard the kitchen cabinets slam. As she walked in the kitchen, we both started to cry. Every cabinet was wide open. She firmly told the spirit to leave her home and family alone. She then went outside to smoke and was on her porch when something very loudly knocked three times on her car. 

Please help. We all are extremely terrified and need advice and someone to come and check and maybe cleanse her house. 

I have read up on the history of the area and was even more concerned to read that there have been quite a few stories of hauntings and poltergeist activity. I am terrified that these grandchildren are targeted or will be harmed in some way. I find it hard to visit due to all the things happening, as well as experiencing it first hand. 

The old cemetery and college site have been labeled as haunted since I was a child. It has always been a very eerie place. Please help in any way possible. Thank you"
"The Shadows In The House","California","Shadow People","When I was very young my family moved into a two story brown house and I was very excited. It had three rooms all upstairs and a second living room but we used that as a different room. When you walk upstairs you would see the bathroom first, then you walk down the hall the first door to your left would be my brother's room. The next room was on the left and it was my older sister's and on the right was the master bedroom that my mom and I shared.

Every day I would dread the night. I hated bedtime because, for me, it meant seeing certain shadows watching me, not letting me sleep. When you walk into the master bedroom, to the right there's the bathroom area with two sinks and in front of the sinks there the bathroom door. The bed was in the center against the main wall and then a window to the right looking out to the backyard with a closet to the far right of the room. 

I remember the same shadow person would hide in the bathroom and leave the door cracked open so it can watch me. It always had a bag and it would always reach in and throw these beautiful glowing figures like a lollipop, stuff kids would be attracted to. One I liked the most was a carousel that would actually move around like the real thing. 

They would float all the way to me and once they passed over my head, I would watch them hit my headboard and break off. Kind of like when a firework is done, the little light specs come running down. I would catch myself trying to reach for them but I stopped myself because I was afraid of what would happen if I took off the blanket I would hide behind."
"Our New Scary House Part 1","Oregon","Haunted Places","Several years ago we came across a house for rent out in the foothills, we couldn't believe how cheap it was and grabbed it. We wanted to get out of the city and we loved all the cows and horses on the property. It was amazing how easy it was to get in, they never did a credit check on us or anything?

I'll never forget the evening we moved in. We were unloading the truck full of boxes. I had them all marked to make it easier. All of a sudden I felt like I was on a boat trying to walk on rough sea?! It was like the ground under me was literally moving! I didn't say a word about it, I didn't know what to think? 

As I started putting clothes away the next day I went out to the garage (it was always so cold in there), and noticed clothes that were supposed to be in the bedroom. I had no idea HOW they got out there since I was alone and there was no one to blame it on. I just took them back in the bedroom. 

This sort of thing would continue to happen the 3 years we lived there. I would find my towels for the bathroom in our hall closet where we keep our jackets. Once I went in the spare room and shoes were paired together backwards, the right shoe would be where the left shoe should go. I would find things in odd spots around the house, I found some chili peppers we grew one summer in my jacket in the closet. I have a big jewelry box and saw something red sticking out from underneath it... My sock that had been missing for months! Things would come up missing only to be sitting where you couldn't miss it months, even a year later?!

I got the shock of my life one morning when I woke up and went in the kitchen to make something for breakfast. My boyfriend always makes an egg sandwich for breakfast and leaves the frying pan on the stove top, he's done it for years. It wasn't there. I looked inside the oven, in all the cabinets and just didn't know where it was. Then I reached down below the stove and pulled open the broiler and there it was, all nice and clean?! 

Mr. C has NEVER washed the dishes before and I couldn't wait for him to get home to ask him. I was standing at the door when he walked in and I asked him, he said NO I didn't wash the frying pan, I left it on the stove. When I showed him where it was (we never put anything in the broiler), he turned white as a sheet... Ghostly white! 

I had so many incidents in that house and was so glad to move. I would cry for no reason and my energy was always gone. I would just drag myself around the house very sad, I'm never like that. I'm in a new house now... But I realize something has followed me. To be continued..."
"'my House Is Haunted'","California","Haunted Places","My Name is Larry Cedeno and I live in South San Francisco California. I live 3.1 miles from the town of Colma, known worldwide as the ""City Of Souls,"" it's the smallest city in San Mateo County with over 1,509 residents and 1.5 million ""souls."" At this time, there are sixteen cemeteries in colma, including a pet cemetery.

 Ten years ago, we moved into our current house, my Children, my wife and the dogs have all had experience's from time to time as I'm describing in this letter.

 Weird things started occurring sometime after we moved into our current house. There was a lot of creaking and weird noises. We were told the house was settling in. If you were in your bedroom, doors would open and close by themselves. Voices coming from other rooms. Shadows streaking across rooms or down the stairs.

 We have a motion sensor bathroom light switch that controls our bathroom light located on the second floor off to side of the bedrooms. A staircase leads down stairs to the main living room. If you were down stairs on the couch, you would hear footsteps coming down the stairs. One time this happened I was on the couch with my two dogs, the bathroom motion light went on, the stairs started creaking, my dogs stared at the stairs, and I watched their heads tracking something slowly across the living room. I grabbed my keys and left the home. 

 One night I was watching TV in the family room and my youngest daughter Savannah was running around the house with a toy laser pointer. I told her to knock it off and to stop playing with the laser pointer. Some moments later, I saw a glow of light emanating from our dining room coming down the hallway. Thought it was my daughter again with the laser pointer. As I leaned off my chair and looked down the hallway to correct my daughter, again instead of seeing her I saw an ORB the size of a Globe that contained a man just the neck up slowly coming down the hallway. I leaned back into my chair and said what the hell. Seconds later I was looking at the wall leading into the family room I could still see the glow of this object still coming down the hallway and it finally breached the doors of the family room moving very slow about 8ft off the ground. I got a very good look at this thing it was a man from the neck collar up in a globe that looked like it was filled with blue sky light. He had roman style hair and beard all white with some kind of gold tassel around a portion of his neck color. It did not see me at first but then he saw me sitting off to the side and this thing cruised over to me, stopped and looked right at or down at me. I was in a recliner at the time. 

The odd thing is I was not scared as I stared at this Orb / Man in a globe of some sort. Located in this room, are bright fluorescent lights located in ceiling. They kicked on and the whole room lit up immediately. It caused me to look at the light switch on the wall to see if one of my family members had turned it on. No one was there. This happened in a split second. I looked at the switch on the wall and turned my head back at the Orb. ""It was gone"". It also triggered two motion flood lamps that lead outside the doors of this room, which leads into the back yard. I got up immediately and ran upstairs to my bedroom, and sat on the bed just staring at my door. 

A few days later after, I calmed down and reflected on what I saw. I realized that this thing or Orb created a diversion and went through the glass doors that led to the back yard tripping the motion lights on the way out. There is one more important thing I need to add. When we first looked at this house, it was not listed on the market. We were looking at a house around the corner when the realtor company called the agent and said they just received a listing for a court divorce sell. The realtor said, ""Let's go look at it - Its right around the corner."" We arrived at what would be our current house today. There were deadbolt locks on all the doors including the front door. You needed a key to get in and out of most of the doors the wife was living upstairs in the bedroom facing the driveway and the husband was living in the back of the house. It was almost like the movie War of the Roses. They built an extension wall and separated the house from each other including separate entrances, kitchens, and bathrooms. This wall and extra kitchen were knocked down after we moved in to restore and open the house back up.

 Today my wife and I are separated and agreed to divorce. We live in the same condition minus the wall. She lives upstairs in the room facing the driveway and I live in the back of the house as the last owners husband did. Coincidence? I believe it is the house.

Thank you for taking the time to read this...

"My Eyes Don't Lie","New Jersey","A Haunted Life","I grew up in a suburban neighborhood where the houses were built brand new. The land was farmland before they built the houses and belonged to the Rancocas Indians before that. 

When I was a child, I would say around 5 or 6 years old, I had my first ghost encounter. It was Christmas Eve, I was sleeping in my bed when I was suddenly and rapidly awoken. I looked towards my bedroom door only to see a grayish/white entity looking dead at me. All I could make out was the head and shoulders. I called out ""Santa?"" a couple of times, being I was so young. 

The entity disappeared down the hallway so I hopped out of bed to follow it. I was suddenly halted by the bedroom door, looking down the hall. The entity was standing at the end of the hall looking at me. I called out ""Santa?"" again. The entity had no legs from the knees down nor feet. It moved/floated towards the back of the house out of my view. I had a terror come over me so I jumped in bed and pulled the covers over my head. The next day, Christmas Day, I woke up with my covers over my head and was still afraid. 

Years later my brother admitted to seeing the same type of entity at night and awoken by them. He checked the house to find nothing and all the doors locked. 

When I was a young teenager I was up alone late one night playing video games. I felt like someone was behind me and the feeling of being watched disturbed me so that I checked the windows for peeping toms. It was getting late so I turned off the game, turned off the lights and headed towards my bedroom in the dark. Something or someone tapped or flicked me on the back of my head. I froze, I said aloud ""Not now, I'm tired and want to go to bed."" I didn't look back and continued to my room.

Only a couple of months after that head tapping, I was in the house alone with our family pet dog. My mother was outside doing some sweeping. Before I headed out the door to help my mother to clean up outside, I placed a drinking glass inside a cup that was inside a bowl. My mother said she didn't need help so I headed back inside where our dog was. When I got back inside the first thing I noticed was that the cup was removed from the bowl and the glass was inside the bowl. The glass would of had to have been lifted, cup removed and the glass put down in the bowl. I looked at the dog and he was acting funny like he was scared and happy I came back in. 

The most recent experience is only a few years ago. I was asleep and I usually wear lounge pants to bed. Something was lifting the cuffs of the pants and letting go. I could feel the lounge pant cuffs lifting and dropping several times. I kicked my legs for whatever was there to stop. It stopped and hasn't happened since but, now it clicks the pens that I keep in my bedroom and moves stuff on the stand where my lamp is and pens are.

This event happened not long ago and is the best experience I ever had and in broad daylight too. I was sitting on my couch putting my socks and shoes on, I'd say it was near noon. I felt the aura of the room change, like all the electricity was sucked out of the living room. Tying one of my shoes, I could see shoes that were transparent about three to four feet away from me. I knew what it was so I didn't want to lose my gaze or blink. I slowly looked up keeping my eyes locked on the entity. I followed the shoes up, the pants were blue jeans in nature. The shirt looked like green flannel button up shirt with long sleeves that was tucked into the pant with a belt. It looked nicely kept, new looking but still transparent. The face was hard to make out being transparent and the dining room behind. But the hair was parted on the side and nicely combed, not messy. It vanished before my eyes and I had to share my experience with family since my grandfather that passed used to dress that way. 

Other than my brother's experience and my own, the rest of my family members refuse to claim to have had experiences. My mother, though, has claimed to feel things walk by her and things being moved around. I did use the flashlight trick that paranormal investigators do and was in contact with someone who claimed not to be a relative nor knew who I was. My mom was there for that."
"My Grandpa Is Still Awesome","Wisconsin","Family / Friends Visits","This is my first story, YGS community! My first 2 stories will focus on unexplainable events related to the sudden and unexpected passing of my grandpa, Grandpa L, in September 1988. I'll split these experiences into 2 stories. 

The first story here will be about paranormal events that occurred shortly after his passing. My 2nd story will focus on later experiences, including some that occurred after Grandma L passed away in June 2018. Some paranormal events I'll share are told to me by other family members, but I think it's important to share my family members' experiences to understand my own. 

Out of respect for my grandparents and their story, this might be a little long. It's also important to summarize some of Grandma's life in order to understand why I think Grandpa visits us. 

If you dare to venture into my lengthy world of bountiful prepositions and misplaced commas, read on! Otherwise, so long, friend! 

Grandma and Grandpa's House Layout (I will refer back to this section in future stories.):

First floor:

Here's a layout of my grandparents' house. I'm putting it here, because I'll refer to it in future stories. Let's start at the front door. That makes sense. Walking into the house, you enter a 2-story foyer. The stairs to the 2nd level are on the left side of the foyer. The stairs are open to the foyer with a wrought iron banister. Straight forward is a small hallway with a large sliding door pantry on the left and bathroom on the right. If you continue to look forward past the pantry and bathroom, you'll see the informal dining area. To the right of the front door is a small hallway with a large closet on the right. If you take that right and walk past the closet, you enter the living room with windows looking out into the front yard. Take a left to enter the dining room area of the living room. The dining room windows look out into the backyard. Take a left through a doorway to enter the kitchen with windows that look out to the backyard. Continue through the kitchen to get to the informal dining table area. You have now successfully walked around the downstairs! Hooray! Look to your left to see the little hallway with the bathroom and pantry that I previously described thoroughly. You can see the front door past that! Magic! Don't turn left down that hall, you fool! We've been there already! Keep going forward through the informal dining table area. The informal dining area has sliding doors on the right that go to the backyard. The basement stairs are on the left. There's a basement down there, I promise. No need to explore that. Next on the left is the garage door. (Spoiler alert! There's a garage behind that door! Shocker.) Now keep walking past all those distracting doors on your left. You've now entered the family room, which is open to the informal dining area and kitchen. The family room is like the living room, but with a TV instead of a piano. My favorite. The family room has sliding doors that open into the backyard. There aren't front yard windows, because the garage is there. There used to be an open field with a valley beyond the backyard. Sometime around the late 1990's-early 2000's, fancy houses were built in this area. Boo to that.

Second floor: 

Starting back at the front door and foyer, take the stairs on the left side of the foyer. The stairs run from the front of the house and head towards the back. Walk up about 4/5ths of the stairs. There's a small landing. Turn right. Head up a few more stairs to end up on the 2nd floor. To your left is my uncle's old bedroom with a window looking out into the backyard. To your right is the open foyer with the wrought iron banister. You can look down and wave at people coming in the front door. You can also throw things at people coming into your house from there, if you so choose. Don't do that right now. There's no time for that! Continue down the hall. On the left is a bathroom and on the right is my mom's old room with a window looking out into the front yard. Straight ahead is Grandma and Grandpa's room. In their room on the right is a window looking into the front yard. Straight ahead is a window looking at the neighbor's house. Walk into their room and take a left. Straight ahead is a sink with a vanity. If the mirror wasn't there, you'd have a window looking into the backyard. To the right is a big walk-in closet. To the left is a bathroom with a window looking into the backyard.

Their Story- Love Found in War (not paranormal section):

The way Grandma and Grandpa met could easily be part of a romantic drama movie script, which makes his young, sudden passing even more tragic. Grandma, her mother, her father, and her grandma survived the horrors of WWII in downtown Berlin, Germany, although her grandma lost everything in the bombings. Grandma L lived close to Tempelhof Airbase and became a translator for General Clay's office. Grandpa, an American flight mechanic, participated in the Berlin Airlift as part of the Army Air Force 53rd Troop Carrier Squadron. 

One day, Grandpa L went to a local tailor to spruce up his uniform. It just so happened that the seamstress was also Grandma's English teacher. The two met, and it was instantly love... For my Grandpa. Ha! I just have to give him a hard time for that. Grandma was a tough cookie, but eventually fell for this American gentleman. They loved each other very much. They married in Berlin on July 4th, 1948. Several military members evacuated their wives from war-devastated Germany on August 27th, 1948, and Grandma arrived in the United States on August 28th, 1948. She was lovingly accepted into Grandpa's family in Wisconsin. In March, she gave birth to twin daughters, my mother (we'll call her Mom) and Ginny.

My Grandma suffered a tremendous amount of tragedy in her life. In 1950, Grandma's grandma in Berlin passed away, never getting to see the reconstruction of the city. In 1953, Ginny (Mom's twin) had scarlet fever and passed away after receiving too much aspirin at a hospital in Wisconsin. In 1959, my #1 favorite uncle was born in Wisconsin. I guess this is a highlight and not a tragedy. (He's my only uncle. #1 by default. Let's call him Uncle P. He's a good guy!) In 1968, Grandma's father passed away in Germany. Finally, another family highlight - Mom met her husband (let's call him Dad) and had my sister (we'll call her ""my sister"") in 1983. In another spectacular move, they had me (we'll call her ""me"") in 1985. 

Unexpected Tragedy (not paranormal section yet.):

Here's where I come in. Nine days after my 3rd birthday in September 1988, I was sitting at a round table near the front door at my parents' house playing in a manner that weird 3 year olds do. My sister was just 11 days shy of her 5th birthday. I'm sure she was doing something equally weird, because kids are weird. I don't remember Mom picking up the phone. I barely remember her running out the door that afternoon to go up to Grandma and Grandpa's house. She went there every day, since it was just across our small town. It wasn't out of the ordinary. In fact, I think she just returned from their house. I can't personally remember what transpired after that. A few years later, I was told details about that afternoon. 

Grandpa was mowing the front lawn and collapsed. A neighbor ran to the house and told Grandma that Grandpa was laying on the ground in the front yard. In the first few seconds of this information, Grandma thought he must be napping or goofing off. He was relatively healthy and only 62, so there shouldn't be anything wrong. She couldn't believe what was happening. Quickly, neighbors ran to Grandpa, including a doctor that lived a few houses down. They began life saving measures, including CPR, until paramedics arrived. Thank God their neighborhood was so close-knit and had several people home at the time. There was nothing that could be done for Grandpa, but at least Grandma wasn't alone before Mom arrived. Mom arrived while they were still trying to save him. Grandpa died of a heart attack in the front yard of the house he built for Grandma. The man she left her family, friends and country for years ago was gone. A month later, Grandma's mother died in Germany. 

Grandpa Still Loves Grandma (Paranormal Section. Thanks for waiting.) 

Mom stayed with Grandma the night Grandpa died. They were both upstairs in their bedrooms. At some point in the night, they both heard footsteps walking through the downstairs. The footsteps were loud enough to wake Grandma. Mom can't remember if she was reading or sleeping when the footsteps started. They listened to the footsteps for several minutes as they moved through the downstairs. I heard this story several times; the foyer, informal dining area, and kitchen were always specifically mentioned, probably because they don't have carpet to dampen the sound. 

Being brave women, they made their way downstairs, probably with Grandma's secret weapon hammer or another household item perfect for bludgeoning. (These women are tiny animals. Mom is 4'11"" and Grandma was ~5'1"", so this scene was probably funnier than it should have been.) They checked the entire downstairs and basement. No one. They both agreed the footsteps sounded like Grandpa's. I would think he was taking a last look around the house he built for his family, but he definitely stayed around a little longer than that night.

Within a week or so, Grandma began getting phone calls in the middle of the night. They were anywhere between 2:30-3:30 am. There was always a man on the other end of the call asking for Grandpa. It sounded like a party going on in the background. The man always asked where Grandpa was. Grandma would tell him that he isn't here and that he died. But the man would ask when Grandpa was coming. I assume Grandma hung up on him. The same 2:30-3:30 am call happened several times. I'm not sure if it was the same guy asking for Grandpa, but there was always a party going on in the background. It was 1989, so unfortunately there was no caller ID available. Grandma and Grandpa never received late night calls like that before. I wonder if it was deceased family or friends asking where Grandpa was, because he was still staying around the house for Grandma instead of crossing over.

I didn't find out about this story until I was about 32 years old. My birthday happens at the beginning of September and my sister's birthday is a few weeks later. I got lots of birthday attention when I turned 3 (before Grandpa died), and my sister was unsatisfied with this situation. Because she was upset, my Grandpa assured her that he'd make sure she'd have a great 5th birthday. Grandpa passed away before her birthday. 

Fast forward a few weeks. Grandma, my parents, my sister, my dad's parents, and I were all hanging around the family room (the room with the TV) on my sister's 5th birthday. Almost 3 decades later, this is what my dad's mom said happened: Everyone was laughing about something and looking down at the kids. I probably did something super cute, but maybe my sister did something agreeable. My dad's mom was seated so she faced into the house looking through the family room, open informal dining room, and kitchen. Standing in the doorway from the informal dining room to the little hallway (with the bathroom and pantry) was Grandpa. He was pleasantly laughing like everyone else as he leaned against the door frame. My dad's mom remembers that he was wearing his checkered golf shorts and had his hand in his pocket. There was no mistaking it. It was Grandpa. My dad's mom isn't really open to paranormal discussion, so this was a complete surprise to hear. I think he was making sure my sister's birthday went well, because he promised her. Being an amazing family man, he was definitely going to keep that promise.

My next story will feature more current events that I experienced along with other members of my family.

I'd also like to say that I'm so glad to have found this wonderful site and community. I've been reading stories for years on here, but only commenting within the last few months. My comments are always meant to be respectful and helpful, and I hope that's how they've been received so far."
"Bonanza","North Dakota","Family / Friends Visits","This happened in 2014. I had finally decided to try out a DVR, since it was included with the satellite dish package I purchased. 

 Mind you I never really learned how the thing worked, so I never got much use out of it. However one day, I noticed that it had recorded something on it's own. I found it strange because I had never really sat down and figured out how to operate it.

 Naturally I was curious as to WHAT it had recorded, so I pushed play and to my surprise it was a recording of an old show called ' Bonanza '. The only time I had ever heard of this show was from my Dad when I was a kid. But here it was. Even more peculiar was that it only recorded part of an episode. I was taken a back by the whole thing and decided to just leave it for a few days.

 During those few days I kept thinking about it and wondering HOW this could even be, WHAT it was all about.

 My Dad had passed away about a year prior to this and I began thinking that maybe he was trying to tell me something. So I finally sat down to watch the recording. In this partial episode it involved a Dad and his sick daughter. She was bed ridden and the father was grieving at her bed side.

 The father seemed so concerned for his daughter, and wanted to help her but could not. He sat there and tried comforting her with his words, as she lay dying. Then the recording ended.

 I knew that up until this point I had already dealt with several health issues and surgeries, while he was alive and he had been there for me. So I couldn't help but wonder if my Dad could now forsee some new health concerns, since he was no longer living. Was he trying to warn me? 

 Not too long after this I began having new health problems and am still having issues that I am currently seeking help for. And I've had to have more surgeries too. 

 I honestly feel like my Dad was trying to tell me of these health issues and that perhaps he wanted to be here for me, but could not."
"Serenading Guitar","California","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","It was the summer of '72 on a hot summer night. I was rather lonely that night because I couldn't find my friends that I usually hang out with. It was dark outside and I was laying on my bed reading a book. I lost track of the time and began to get sleepy, so I put my book away and turned off the light for sleep.

As soon as I laid my head down on the pillow I couldn't move?! I felt a cool tingling sensation come over my body, I got goose bumps. I could hear some kind of wrapper being rolled up and tossed. I lay there trying to move, it was very quiet. All of a sudden there was someone standing there at the side of my bed wearing cowboy boots. I couldn't look up or in any other direction. Then I heard a guitar begin to play. It was soft and so lovely, music I had never heard before. It went on for some time and I felt this sadness as if the guitar player was telling me something through the music. It touched me to my soul. I remember I just wanted to cry, but I couldn't.

I lay there in my room listening until the guitar player stopped. All of a sudden I could move, I sat up in bed as fast as I could but no one was there?! I even looked for the wrapper I heard being crumpled up and tossed on the floor, nothing. I just sat there with the lights on trying to process what had just happened, was it a dream? I just knew it wasn't. I finally calmed down and turned off the lights to go to sleep. As soon as my head was on the pillow the whole episode started all over again?! I couldn't move and my body had this weird kind of tingling sensation. I've never heard the melody before or since. But I could feel those guitar cords being played all the way to my soul. It was so beautiful, sad and sweet at the same time. I still remember this happening from time to time, and wonder..."
"Gretel And Moe","Georgia","Pets / Animals","I have read many stories on this site where people have said that their departed pets have returned to comfort them.

Eleven years ago both of my cats, Gretel and Moe, were killed by my sister's dog. I was staying with her while I was moving into a new house.

A long time passed during which I was inconsolable.

I felt like it was my fault and I should have never left the house. I kept reliving my sister's words to me. 

She said they found Moe with a broken neck under some knocked over boxes in the laundry room floor. Somehow Gretel had climbed her way up an empty wall to a high shelf and was balled up and they thought she was just terrified. They brought her down and blood was coming from her mouth. She died on the way to the vet. They waited until I got there to tell me because they didn't want me to get in a wreck driving home. I'll never forget the word she used. Surreal. She said that the lock on the dog door had been broken in and that the dog in question was sleeping on the floor nearby. Nobody is as protective over your pets as you are.

All hours of the day I would hear cat activity going on around me. I would hear their jingle ball toys even though I had them put up in a drawer. I heard something going at the scratching post sometimes and it was put away in the closet. At least half of the times I would open a door I would feel a little cat rush past my ankles on it's way out the door. All of these things happened in the new house that my cats had never been in.

This went on for long enough that I visited a psychiatrist. It troubled me to the point where I couldn't sleep. 

The psychiatrist told me that what I was experiencing was like my mind playing tricks and that when someone is used to certain things happening after specific triggers then their mind can have them relive it. I don't remember his exact wording but be assured that it was infinitely better than mine. He also said that my feeling of guilt plays a role. Then he let me know that I hadn't lost my mind.

All of that sounds good but I worked in a busy pharmacy then and I work in another one now. I experience a tremendous amount of persistent and repetitive events every day. I have bad dreams that I have to explain to people that their insurance won't cover their medication and it costs a million dollars. I don't relive any of that when I'm away from it.

Furthermore, his parting words to me that day were: ""Cats only live about fifteen years, anyway.""

I laughed out of awkwardness and said that was a little insensitive. He must not be an animal lover.

Later that week I went to a craft store and bought some oven-bake clay, made two cat figurines and painted them exactly how they looked. I even made Gretel slightly overweight and I made Moe look aerodynamic. Then I apologized to them and I put them on my bed's headboard. I felt better.

One thing my sister said to me was that the whole event went down about ten paces from where my infant niece was sleeping in her rocker. Later on that thought returned to me and it occured to me that maybe it's possible that they died in her place. Had they not been the first thing the dog met when it broke in something bad might have happened to my sister's baby. The notion that maybe they saved her life was a help to me.

A long time passed and I no longer believe the dog would have attacked my niece. My cats were new animals in it's territory and it hated cats. Not necessarily small creatures in general. 

I do think it was my cats visiting me when I was heartbroken. Wishing to make me feel better and stop beating myself up."
"Grandma's Visit?","Ohio","Family / Friends Visits","It has been a while since I last posted on here, and as bad as I feel about that, I haven't had many experiences lately. However, I did have a visit not long ago.

My grandmother, who was more like a mother, passed away in May. This is a woman who was open to the paranormal, and if something was too upsetting, would have me cleanse the house to rid of the energy.

We were always close, sharing treats, secrets, interests. And 2 months after her passing, I was sleeping in (no work that day). While I don't remember most of her visit, as I was waking up I heard her say ""Time to go.""

I wasn't ready to leave, and replied with a ""Don't you dare!"" Which she didn't listen to (she never did haha) I then woke up crying not out of sadness and loss, but out of loneliness. Now I have no one here in my home that believes on this stuff.

But at the same time she is also pestering my uncle, by constantly resetting the microwave when he uses it (which is something he would have done to her. They enjoyed pranking each other.) 

So, I'm also a practicing pagan, so in an effort to stay in tune with my grandmother, I was speaking to her while out for a walk. Now the plan before was to move away from my uncle (he is a toxic person) once she passed, and I was feeling unsure at this point because of her passing. So (and there were not many butterflies around at the time) I asked her o send a butterfly as a response. I asked if moving out was still in the plans. Right as I asked a beautiful black and orange butterfly went past. So now I'm trying to save to move out of this highly toxic environment.

So those are my latest ones, thanks for reading. Have a good morning/day/evening"
"Something Demonic","North Dakota","Haunted Places","As I've said before, I have always dealt with unusual & paranormal things. I've become use to all of it. However in the current house I'm living in that we are buying, there have been some things that I feel are out of the usual hauntings I have dealt with.

 They say that demons and such are known to work with the number 3, in order to mock the trinity. This is why I believe that perhaps this time around I may be dealing with something of that nature & to be honest it worries me!

 In the 2 years that we have lived here, I have heard a number of disturbances, my dogs have started growling and barking at nothing. They also refuse to go in the back yard at night. I have felt the blanket on my bed move, and on a few occasions my kids and I have heard someone knock on the door 3 times, only to find no one there.

 Normally when there are spirits or energy in a place, I can usually pick up on it and I felt a bit of relief when we bought this house because I didn't feel anything attached to it. 

 So I am a bit confused as to why there is something here, but I didn't feel it when we moved in.

 The first thing that happened, was this: My son and I were in the kitchen cooking some sort of snack and he had gone into the pantry towards the back of the house. I was standing at the stove tending to our snack and thought that he had returned from the pantry, because I saw a shadow out of the corner of my eye walk up near me. When I turned to him, the shadow quickly moved away and vanished.

 On several occasions I will be sitting with my dogs late at night and will hear a bump or something of that nature in the kitchen area and the dogs will be looking over in the direction the sound came from. At other times randomly my dogs will start growling and barking at nothing. At night they act frightened to go to the back yard to potty.

 My husband works nights and so I sleep alone, and there have been times I felt the blankets move slightly or as if something caressed my side. My bed frame is iron and a few times it sounded like something banged on it. 

 On a few different occasions, my kids and I were sitting in the living room and heard 3 knocks upon the door. We found it odd because of what time of night it was, when we would check to see who it was there was no one there. Furthermore the door that had been knocked on was not the front door, but the door that led to the living room that was attached to the mudroom.

 When we first moved in and hadn't put up the fence yet and my husband had some of his tools laying outside; just outside the mudroom, I was sitting in the mudroom late one evening next to the window; which I had open because I was smoking. I was caught off guard by the sounds of someone or something just outside the window going through my husbands tools. I was amazed that someone would have the nerve to do that when clearly people were home, so I gave a cough as to let them know I was there and aware that they were on my property. They immediately stopped rummaging through our things, but after a few moments began again. Then I heard them leaving and saying something. Not sure what that was or if it was even anything paranormal, but pretty unsettling nonetheless. The following day I decided to go and see what the thief had taken, but to my surprise nothing was gone.

 Several months ago, I decided to invest into a spirit box in hopes of communicating with my deceased father. Although I was getting a pretty decent amount of input, I never did hear from my Dad. I became convinced that what I am dealing with here is not a spirit and may wish me harm. I was sitting in the mudroom, late at night and with only a candle for my light. It seemed to draw them closer to me and I would hear lots of chatter through the box. The voices were warning me of danger and then they went silent. A little while later I started hearing low growls emanating from the box. It freaked me out so I turned it off. I turned the lights back on and was just sitting there sort of alarmed at what I had heard, when I hear 3 scratches on the wall just outside my window. I felt it would be in my better interest if I quit messing with the spirit box for a little while and put it away.

 Several months went by and I had a craving to pull out the box once again. So that's what I did. The box was pretty silent, but then I heard a voice tell me 'yours' and that the door was locked. 

 I found it creepy because I was sitting by the back door, which I had open and had the screen door shut and locked. The voice said harm you and then let out a growl. Needless to say I shut the box off. Since that night I have gotten rid of the box. But every night while I'm sitting out in the mudroom, with the door open and screen door shut; I always hear the stairs shift and something hook it's claws into the lip on the metal of the screen door.

 I am not about to move out, this is our home. But I am afraid of having something evil here! Any suggestions as to what I could do to rid our home of this problem would be greatly appreciated."
"The Child Not Really There","Louisiana","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I started this over a year ago (I write these in a doc and then cut and paste when I feel ready), and today I decided I would make an effort to put it into words because over time I return to this story a lot in my mind. I have hinted at experiences I had at a home I where I lived in Louisiana, and here is one. When this happened to me, it didn't scare me, but I have to admit that now it actually does scare me a little because I don't understand what happened. I don't have answers, and can't explain it to myself even.

 We lived in Louisiana because my husband was military. We had lived on the base for 18 months. It was not a happy place to live, and when I finally learned that we were going to be stuck there for a while, I decided I wanted a house. We looked at 3 houses that were for sale, and settled on one. It was a little fixer upper, but I loved that little house. Now for fixer upper, it didn't need a lot of work. It needed paint, some new flooring, and a few new appliances - mostly cosmetic. It was all of 1,200 square feet. It had 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. Coming from base housing it was a huge upgrade as we only had 900 square feet and 2 bedrooms, and 1 bathroom for our small family. 

 We had two small girls at the time. Both are grown and teens at this time. I have written about one of them who I call Jacey. This story probably relates to her. In fact, it might relate to her ""friends."" If you don't know about her friends, it's not a bad idea to go back and visit that story, or take a look at it after this one if you prefer.

 This happened at night. My husband has always been very big about not having the kids sleep with us. He's kind of a big guy. He worried if a kid was in the bed he might squish them. I was always the one that if a kid woke up, they would wake me up and I'd usher them back to bed. I have always thought of myself as a heavy sleeper, but always woke when the kids came in the room. Nothing bothers my hubby when he sleeps. I remember it was 3:00 or 3:30 in the morning. I was woken by a kid standing by the bed. I thought it was Jacey. There was a window next to my side of the bed, but she was standing just outside the light of the window in the shadows. She was holding her blanket (both of the kids had blankets they were very attached to). I remember sitting up, standing and saying, ""Jacey, let's go back to bed. Come on."" Now, I was NOT asleep, and this was not a dream. I am one of those people when I am woken at night, I am very awake and can struggle to go back to sleep. I got out of bed and walked the 3 or maybe 4 steps toward Jacey thinking that she was very ""black"" and was surprised not more light was coming in the window as there was quite a bit of light that came in that window (one of the reasons I liked my spot in the bedroom). As soon as I was maybe a step from her, I realized this was not Jacey. It didn't feel like Jacey (feel as in feeling a person's presence), it is too small to be Jacey, it looks wrong, and it is not responding to me. ""Jacey"" suddenly blew apart. The blackness exploded, and it reminded me of black glitter as she rained down and the black glitter just disappeared to nothing. 

 I remember I ran out of my bedroom across the hall to Jacey's room. Jacey was in bed sleeping. I went back to my bedroom and stood there. I went back to Jacey's room and I got very close to her. I thought maybe she was pretending to sleep. How did she make it back to her room and get to sleep so fast? Was she playing with me? I realized she was sleeping and the emotions/feelings I had knowing that what I saw was not Jacey came flooding back to me. I left Jacey's room, checked on our other daughter who was also sleeping soundly and I went back to bed. I considered waking up my husband, but didn't know what I'd tell him. It took me a long time to go to sleep after that. I was up for close to an hour and did one of my tours of the house where I would walk all through the house a few times over. 

 I didn't feel any malice or threat coming from whatever it was. For all I know it could have been a child looking for a ""mom."" I encountered something just like it one more time, and I will save that for another story. I also had one more experience with the ""black"" exploding, but will save that as well, but it again happened in my room at night and woke me from sleep."
"The House With The Unfortunate Past","Idaho","Haunted Places","Let me begin by filling you in on my first house. The year was 1996 and I was pregnant with my first child, my ex husband and I had been living with his parents far too long and with a baby on the way we knew we simply had to get a place of our own. It had seemed that with the monthly income we made, this would be an almost impossible goal. That is until we were made aware of an old house that his grandmother had owned, that had just been sitting and unoccupied since the incident. 

 Story goes, my ex husband's grandma, uncle & aunt had purchased an older home inside the city limits; after the state had bought their home on the range in order to lay down the interstate and place a rest area back in the 1950's. So with their new lump of money, the three of them relocated to their new home. 

 All I was told was that, Ilene (the Aunt) had been attacked and sexually assaulted by three men one evening in the alleyway behind the house. This unfortunate event took a toll on her and she quickly lost her mind, being forced by the state to be placed into the local insane asylum. Basically her last days were spent in the house. Shortly after being admitted she took her own life.

 Some time later the grandmother took a fall down the front steps and required around the clock nursing care, and so she was also admitted into a nursing home. Shortly after her admittance, she passed away.

 In the end the only one left in the house was the uncle, who reportedly was already mentally unstable and I imagine that all of this was too much for him to bare; apparently he attempted to take his own life in this house by slashing his wrists. He was not successful and was also admitted into a facility for his own safety.

 So here sat this house, with it's tragic history all shut up for years. When we (my ex husband & I) decided to try and talk the uncle into letting us live there dirt cheap. He seemed all to happy to have visitors and almost excited that someone wanted to live in his home, that at one point had meant so much to him and his family.

 As I've said before, I have a rich past of dealing with the paranormal and unexplainable, so the history of the house didn't really affect my decision. I just knew that I was having a baby and desired to have my own place.

 I felt the place just needed some sprucing up and thought that by having some young people and the arrival of a new baby inhabiting it, would be just what the house needed.

 My ex husband worked the night shift at a local restaurant around that time, and would sleep during the days; which wouldn't leave much time to get the place ready for moving in. I figured that while he was at work, in order to kill two birds with one stone I would go and clean it up and give a fresh coat of paint. The first & last night I decided to head over there and paint, I remember there being a very unwelcoming feeling about the place when I pulled up. I didn't let it stop me and grabbed my gear and headed inside. 

 Once inside, I begin to wonder if we had made a bad decision about moving into the house. But I have always believed that once you start something you should finish it and stick it out, no matter what! So I took a couple of deep breaths, cleared my mind and started in on the painting.

 I knew I was not alone, and that was fine. I kept hearing odd noises in different parts of the house. I was determined to get the painting done and wasn't going to let it deter me. That is until I begin to hear voices and hissing of sorts. I began to feel uneasy with that, but still I held true to the task. I was in the living room and on the other side of the wall was the bathroom, which still had one of those metal chairs in the shower used for people who cannot stand up and take a shower on their own. I heard some scuffling in the bathroom and then what sounded like the metal chair being sat in abruptly or moved, so I stop painting and listen some more. I hear the bathroom door shut and some more hissing. 

 Standing there not moving, still facing the wall with paint roller in hand I'm just kind of waiting to see what comes next. I refused to look away from the wall in fear of maybe seeing something, I would rather not see. I knew in that moment that the spirit or whatever was in the room with me, very near me. At that point I figured that if I showed no fear, it would not do much. The next thing I knew right next to my ear I hear a whisper saying ' Dawnelle '. It knew my name! I dropped that roller right in the paint pan and left that place as quick as I could; all the lights still on, doors unlocked and radio playing! 

 You would think I would have decided to revoke the decision to move in at that point, but the situation at my in laws was less than desirable and I was getting ready to have my first kid, I felt it just had to happen. Besides would could REALLY happen, how bad could it truly get?! On a comparative scale, I decided that dealing with this ' spirit's would be a cake walk compared to dealing with the whole situation at the in laws house, so I decided it would be best NOT to tell my ex husband of what had happened that night.

 I simply told him that the pregnancy had me feeling exhausted and that I thought it would be best if we finished painting the house on his days off.

 We lived a total of three years in the house with only a handful of occurrences. 

 One evening while my husband was at work, I was up late and very pregnant feeling the need to do some deep cleaning as the due date of the baby was very near. Us mothers refer to this as the nesting instinct. There I was standing in the kitchen, when I heard voices coming from the basement. It sounded strange; like that of a radio station that wasn't well tuned. But it just kept on talking and then stopped. I walked over to the door that led to the basement and locked it. I decided that it would be a good idea to just keep that door locked at all times. I would hear the voices in the basement often, but that was about it. I never mentioned it to my ex husband.

 One morning while lying in bed I happened to notice a set of faint handprints on the ceiling above me.

I just thought huh, that's an odd spot for handprints; considering that the ceilings were so tall. But didn't think too much about it.

 On another occasion we were heading to bed and had made it to the bedroom when the television turned on all by itself. My ex husband and I just looked at eachother and he walked over and shut it off.

 One night I was awakened by yelling coming from the living room. As I laid there listening, it was obvious to me that the television had once again turned itself on and seemed like the volume was all the way up.

 I found myself once again laying in bed and staring at the ceiling and happened to notice that there were now a few sets of handprints. It seemed like, each time I would look at that ceiling there would always be more sets of handprints. 

 In the dining room, there was always this big stain that no matter what I did, what company I hired to clean the carpet; the stain would always reappear. I found it rather peculiar. So I went and asked the uncle where exactly in the house did he cut his wrists and he told me the dining room. After repeated attempts at getting rid of the stain, it became apparent that the sting was there to stay. I placed a throw rug over it as a solution to the problem.

 Voices in the basement, the television randomly turning on by itself and unexplainable handprints; were all that we had to deal with. Not so intolerable, right. 

 Well some time after our first child was born, the Uncle in the middle of the night called me up desperately asking me to get him out of the nursing home was in. So he came to live with us in his house. We had been living there for over a year at that point. The paranormal activity, seemed to cease once he was living with us.

 I became pregnant with our second child when our first born was a year old. The pregnancy went accordingly, but around the time I was 7 months along I had an accident.

 It was winter time and the front steps were covered in ice. I had pleaded with my ex husband to make the stairs ice free several times, but he neglected to do so. We were going somewhere and I was heading down the stairs, when suddenly my feet slipped! In hopes of protecting the baby I grabbed a hold of the stair rail and sort of aimed my body in a way to land on my back. Mind you these were the very stairs that his grandmother had met her demise. I was rushed to the hospital and the baby and I were placed on 24 hour observation. Thankfully we were alright, according to the ER doctors. However the remainder of my pregnancy became extremely difficult. I had planned a natural birth, but turned out as an emergency C- section.

 When our second baby was merely 2 months old, my ex husband's Uncle decided to kick us out and take everything from us. We ended up moving out of that house then and never returned. However when my second child was about 10 months old, I started getting very sick; not being able to hold down any food or any liquids and a very drawn out sickness that no one could pinpoint engulfed my life. After the whole run around with numerous visits to the ER, specialists and painful suffering; 2 years later the problem was finally found. Turned out that when I fell on those stairs during my second pregnancy, the jolt of the baby's body had crammed my spleen up against my pancreas and up against my spine; in results killed my spleen, 60% of my pancreas and severely damaged my spine. I nearly died because of that one fall and it has ultimately stole my physical health since I was 22 years of age, it caused a sort of spiral affect and since then I have known nothing other than surgeries and great physical pain. Looking back I wish that I would just stayed at my in laws instead of moving into that house, at least I would still have had my health."
"Horrible, No-good, Very Bad Schoolhouse","Utah","Haunted Places","Even though I may be tough, I am often scared of what I can feel, so I take my cues for response from people around me. I also have such a wild imagination that I am fully capable of freaking myself out, which I have owned up to in other posts. What happened here scared the holy crap out of me, but I did not ""allow"" myself to acknowledge out loud whatever it was, at the moment. I very strongly believe in intention and try not to give in to negative energy. Sort of the awake version of putting one's head under the covers, hoping ""It"" goes away when a monster crawls out from under the bed. Thank you for taking your time to read this.

Unlike most of the stories I have shared with you, my fellow YGS readers, this is not one that has anything I can ""prove"" to myself by what other people ""saw"" or experienced with me, but it terrifies me the worst to this day. I could not sleep last night, thinking of it, still scared. Please forgive the length of this post.

The location and names I will keep for privacy. I hope I make sense explaining it to you. I was already grown up when my parents moved to a tiny desert ""base"" town in Utah. This story is embarrassing because I was too scared to act or respond.

My mom was the school librarian for 23 years at the little public school, built in the 50/60's (?) The main building was a kind of an H layout, with some outside ""modular"" classrooms. The admin office, staff WC/lounge, gym and cafeteria were all by the front, South entrance hall on the center ""bar"" of the H. My Mom's library was a couple doors down, on the ""outer"" side of the lower ""leg"" or Southeast wing of the H. There were self-locking ""exit only"" fire doors at the end of each hall, which can be used, but not held open, without setting off the alarms. The entire campus was demolished, the year after my mom retired. I do not know if the new school got built there.

As a visitor, I always went in through the front doors to the office. I may have been in the cafeteria once, but I never really went past the hall where you go from the office around the corner to my Mom's library. I had entered a few of the classrooms on that wing and the teacher's lounge during daylight hours.

 I had only visited my Mom a few times during school, in her little library. It had a ""reading dragon"" and a ""life sized"" statue of a beloved fictional character. I was not personally fond of this odd, adorable statue, but my mom talked to it and dressed it for holidays. The little kids loved it, too, of course. I always felt overgrown and out of place, even in her library. One time I was there to see my sister in law dressed up as Clifford the Big Red Dog for the book fair. Happy thoughts, happy thoughts...

I chalked up my general dislike for the building to the fact that it always stunk like grubby little children and rotted wood. Sorry to those who love kids; they do leave a stink. I disliked how the school felt, but shrugged it away. Many public schools out west are flat, plain, painted cinder block buildings, with upper inside windows along the halls. The open layout makes it so you can see into most hallways and classrooms from outside or the opposite wings. All my elementary schools had looked, dismally, more or less, the same. Many of them also had given me the same used, unpleasantly familiar, crowded but empty, ""old"" feeling when I was young. So no biggie: some schools I'd visited were much larger, older and creepier in the poor rural regions of my childhood. (I am looking at you, Middleton JHS.) However, I had never been to any of them alone after dark. 

When my mom retired I came from the West Coast to help her clean her library and trim the collection. She struggled with tossing anything. I flew to help close her deadline to clear out. I love my mom, and I also hoard books, but I pushed her pretty hard to save what she could and damn the rest. I have worked in Used Books so I am accustomed to the heartache of ""Discards"". We filled many boxes of donations. Piles of books lined the halls outside. We also had to pile up the trash there, as we'd be locked out trying to get to the dumpsters. The custodian was on vacation. My mom was worried about how he would react to all the piles of trash bags and recycling in the hall when he got back.

Anyway, on previous visits, I had found the teeny tiny stalls and tinier toilets in the student bathrooms were way too little for my large person to use. So I had avoided going in there since, and I had never been on the ""Boy's"" side until I needed garbage bags to help my mom clean that summer day. The custodian supply room was just inside past the doorway to the boy's side bathroom. Because I have worked as a janitor I have a habit of announcing my femme self when entering a Men's room. These restrooms had no doors, and were side by side, where the entrance hall met my mom's wing, opposite the staff lounge.

When I first went in on the boy's side, I felt what could be the normal, elementary school transgressiveness of being in the (gasp) wrong bathroom, even though we were, for sure, the only ones there. Alas, I have spent way too much time cleaning bathrooms for there to be much novelty in that. With each trip into the ""closet"" for supplies my feelings grew to a more specific and very VERY unwelcome menacing absolute of something bad watching me and lurking close by. Eventually I just grabbed up a bunch of stuff and decided not to be in there again. This was on my first day of the trip. I felt like a ninny for being scared, even though it was a strong, involuntary, physical response.

That first night we stayed until seven or so, before it was dark. Mom said she wanted to be out by nine and I assumed it was district policy.

The next day was Friday, we barely had time to meet the deadline. Once again, after 3 or 4 pm we were the only people in the whole school. I was a little out of patience with my loving mother when I discovered that, in addition to the treasures of her library, we also needed to clear out two large storage spaces. These unused areas were located across the hall from the bathrooms, between the teachers lounge and office area. Leaving my mom to tearfully catalog a stack of stragglers, I set out to basically toss or recycle twenty years worth of holiday and book fair decorations. 

That whole time I was very much aware that I was NOT alone and I worked as fast and as quietly as possible. I did not want to be there in the hall or those storage cubbies after dark, no sir. The lurking feeling got stronger and more ominous, it seemed to seethe down the hall, up to the doorway of the library, coming from the bathrooms. I felt cornered in, followed, and watched in the small storage areas. It was all I could do not to run away back to my mom. After a stern lecture to my coward heart, I gave up on sorting the mess, and just shoveled it all into trash bags. Thus I quickly finished the storage areas. 

My mom was tired, and sad to leave her school. We still had a very steep amount of cleaning and at least three sections of shelves to trim. We were up to our eyeballs in dust and books, working until it was dark and only the ""emergency"" lights lit the halls. She had turned on the real lights right in our part of the hall, though. The evil feeling was still there, but worse. My mom also locked us in, once it was dark, without saying anything. I felt safe enough with her, in the library, even if I felt like something was lurking near us in the empty hall. I felt very much like we were cornered by some angry, vengeful watcher.

Eventually Mom said she wanted to go home. I looked at my watch. It was only 8 pm, we still had an hour; so I said we should grind on. The end of our task was in sight. We powered through and managed to catalog or trim all the relevant materials. All that was left was to load some personal things and donations to take them away. We decided to do it the next day, because the car was full. At least the district's to-do list was complete in time for her to turn in her keys. 

I do remember forcing myself not to look back as I walked to the end of the hall and the lights of the fire exit. I waited, arms full, while Mom locked her classroom door. Mom went around the corner to drop her keys to the office, then hit the hall lights off. I have never in my adult life been more afraid of the dark than in those few moments it took for my mom to come back down that very short hallway. I have huge goosebumps now trying to write this. The dark shadows from the rest of the school seemed rushing to eat us both alive. I mean to say that I could feel with every inch of my being that some thing or many things was angry and present. Like ""the predator is actually right beside you about to gobble your ass-NOW RUN"" type of physical, animal certainty. My mom moved slow and tired toward me. I tried to be cool and not scream. There was nothing to be seen or heard. I felt like if I showed an inch of fear or acknowledgement, my mom and I would both be done for.

My mom is a tough cookie, but her retirement and gutting her collection had her in an emotional state. I had also further upset her by throwing stuff away, which she had just found around the corner. (Note: I am not much of an actor and a worse liar.) So I did not say anything or run screaming outside. 

We left, checked the door behind us, and crammed into the car. Since I was also tired, and I watch way too many movies, I just shook off the horrorshow feeling. Honestly, everywhere I go in Utah has some level of scary crappy energy. I did not want to complain or to scare my mother. I was just very glad to be done. Also I did not want to admit what a chicken I am.

My mom said something about how she hoped any restaurants might be still open, and I realized my watch was on Pacific time. So we had left the school around eleven thirty, not nine-thirty like I thought.

The next morning we went back to fetch the remaining items. School started that next week. Many of the staff were prepping their classrooms. One of them waved and sent his teenage kid to open the fire door for us, the one we had exited the night before. Everything was too sunny and loudly fine. My mom went into his classroom and after introductions, the kid politely offered to help me carry things to the car. My mom stayed to chat with her colleague.

The boy says casually, as we walked up the hall ""So, you were here late last night-did you hear ghosts?""

Trying to be cool, I was all, ""Noooo...has that happened to you?"" 

Then this young kid tells me, all nonchalant, how he has heard ghostly children voices. That people had seen ghost figures, or heard footsteps across empty halls and the empty roof of that wing, for many years. How no one ever stays at the school alone or after dark, even the janitors. I tried not to barf or cry. He sort of smiled kindly at the look on my face and said ""it scares my dad too"" and that his dad, ""won't be here anymore alone or at night"" since the one night ""he and another teacher chased some voices that also slammed doors but no one was here."" I felt like someone was pouring ice into my guts. Even the dusty sunlight seemed scary. I could tell he was trying to be nice by changing the subject of conversation. I did not tell him what happened or how scared I was, but he seemed to feel bad for bringing it up.

Needless to say, I packed up fast and with his help made just that one last trip.

Once we were both safe in the car again I brought up what the kid had said. I told my mom how scared I was in the bathroom, and the night before, and just then in broad daylight with other people. In response she just casually threw out how the staff had ""all heard and seen creepy stuff FOR YEARS,"" especially in the tunnels (WHAT?!) which go from that boys bathroom, under the school, to the other side of the gym. She calmly said that is why ""she tries to be out by nine, because she knows she cannot fight whatever 'It' is, alone or after dark, since she wouldn't let 'It' into her library."" At this point nothing on this Earth could have got me back in that school.

She is very religious so her matter-of-fact reaction surprised me. Three cheers to my mom, the brave little librarian who apparently educated several generations of kids while terrible lurking nasties crept around their school. (Her beloved fictional character's statue got moved to the office for that last year. I like to think he helped guard my mom, and then that very last class of students after she left.) I had no idea if Mom coped with that same level of hateful, lurking, carnivorous evil energy for twenty something years, day after day, but DAMN.

I did not know what to say sitting there in the bright summer sun. I just cried. It was a terrible, no-good, very bad weekend. I really hate to visit Utah."
"The Fate Of A Beautiful Soul","Kansas","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","Been some time since I have posted something here. But a heartbreaking incident happened a couple of months ago. I lost my mother after she battled with pancreatic cancer for over a couple of years. To see the amount of pain she went through, I almost wished her a painless death everyday. While God answered my prayers in part, the best aspect here was I got to spend a whole 3 months with my mum and she peacefully breathed her last in my lap. 

I quit my job to stay with my mother and my wife took care of the kids. All of us lived together. Before I proceed to the story, a bit of philosophy to all the lovely souls here, please spend a lot of time with your parents. They become kids towards the last stages of life and crave for our attention. Please do not alienate them at any cost. After all, they put up with our tantrums when we were young and we should return the favor. Please. There is no point in regretting later.

Now, going back to the story, like I mentioned earlier, I spent 3 whole months with my mum. I caught up for all the lost time, only for her. She was very happy and I gladly did everything for her. We used to talk for hours together and my mum would go on and on about everything that has happened in our life ever since I was born. During one such day, she felt emotional and told me how I used to cry non stop as a kid asking for my dad (my dad passed away when I was young). Then she paused. Looked skywards and said ""only if he had listened to me"". That shook me off balance. And I asked her what happened. She hesitated and told me that she had kept this a secret all through her life. 

Story from my mum on the first day of our discussion - 

My mom and dad lived a very short happy life together. I am the result of their happiness. As per my mom, dad always made fun of my mum for believing in paranormal and her reading through tarot cards. I cannot blame my dad, because as far as I know, he is a very religious person and believed that fate is to be faced than predicted. My dad has always been a busy person at work and used to work long hours. My mum could feel my dad being depressed, but when checked with him he refuted the claim and said he was fine. After her tarot readings, my mum asked my dad if he has been disturbed by anything. My dad refused to answer and said he does not want to discuss it. Then one fine day, my dad opened up, saying he senses death soon. He felt that he is going to leave his family soon. My mum comforted him saying everything is going to be alright. The next day when she woke up, mum noticed that dad was still sleeping. She has never seen him like that as dad used to leave for work early every day. Mum let him sleep for some more time and by the time dad woke up, he was very late for work. After his shower, mum asked him why he woke up late to check on him if he was feeling alright. Dad mentioned that he had a dream as if he was burning to death with people watching and not able to help him, and that left him very disturbed. Mum, being herself, took her tarot card kit, did her reading and told him not to leave for work in the morning as the signs are not in favor towards his health. Dad refused to listen and left for work. He never returned. 

He met with an accident when a young driver jumped a STOP sign and hit my dad's car from the left side. Dad's car was crushed between a sidewall and the other car and was burned alive as he was stuck. 

Mum told this story and looked at me without shedding a tear. She said ""I did not tell you this story because I never wanted you to feel bad about your dad. Your dad was a great man and so are you. He would be proud that I brought you up as a gentleman"". I was uncontrollable. I fell on my mother's foot and was crying. What a strong woman she was. The amount of pain, the young lady went through 35 years back was unimaginable. She never married again, because of the fear of me not getting enough attention. She is the angel of my life. 

Love you, ma! 

After a couple of days went by, I asked my mom. So, where did dad get this feeling all of a sudden? Why was he scared and depressed? How would someone get that feeling for no reason?

Mum looked a bit anxious when I asked her these questions. She said dad had a very tough childhood and was deviating from my question. I stopped her and asked her sternly. WHAT HAPPENED? 

Complete story on day two - 

Then she opened up. Dad is a very religious person. He always believed that there is an energy watching over us and that will guide us. And that was the reason he never believed in tarot predictions as fate will find its own way to reach you. 

A month and a half before his death, dad was coming back from work on a rainy night. It was quite late in the night and he saw a lady standing near an overpass. It was quite late for someone to be standing there so he stopped and asked her if she needs to be dropped somewhere. Dad asked her if he needs to call someone, she said she is lost after her walk and would like to get dropped at the hospital closeby. Dad took her in and dropped her at the hospital. During the drive to the hospital, she had mentioned to dad that she has had a very rough childhood and she ended up here because of her parents as they used to abuse her. She said her parents died of drug overdose and she was left with nothing. Since my dad had a rough childhood too, he empathized with her and said he will come and meet her often with his family and she will not feel alienated. 

Dad went home and narrated the ordeal to my mother and both of them decided to go check on the girl over the weekend. The next weekend, when they went to the hospital to check on her, they found out that the girl had died 3 weeks earlier by electrocuting herself. Dad was shocked as he met the girl a few days earlier. A confused dad, walked back with my mum to the car and out of the facility. On the way back, dad stopped near the overpass and told mum this is where he met the girl a couple of days back and was just getting extremely paranoid. Mum was trying to understand the situation, when, he turned back to my mum who was near the car door and was frozen for a few seconds. My mom was puzzled. When asked, he said that he saw the girl right next to my mum and then she disappeared. My mom felt very worried for my dad and never left him alone for the next few days. 

Dad was never the same after this incident. He used to wake up suddenly from the sleep sweating and gasping for breath. He said the girl follows him everywhere. My mum felt that dad has attracted an entity and whenever mum tried to help him, dad never cooperated. After many failed attempts to convince my dad, mum gave up and started praying for my dad's health. And everytime she did that, she said, she will never be able to complete the prayers as there will be some distraction.

Mum felt dad was attracting more negative energy with his behavior and the failed prayer attempts were of no help as well. Before she could figure out a way to help dad, he passed away. 

I felt so heavy that day. I don't know what to comprehend. My mom cried as well, so I did not bother her with more questions. The only thing she said was, ""I have helped so many people in these situations, but I couldn't help your dad"". 

I have more questions than normal. The reason being, why would a spirit randomly follow someone and disturb their peace. My dad meant no harm to the girl or the spirit, he just stopped and helped like any person would. So is that seen as a sign of acceptance to let the spirit follow you? Maybe dad's accident was just coincidental, but why should he meet such a fate after being so sincere his whole life.

Life can be cruel sometimes. All I infer is, Dad was right. You can predict anything but you need to face your fate, be it good or bad. And his fate, was to meet his end in a fatal accident. 

P.S - I will definitely reply to the comments but with some delay as I will be shifting to a new place next week!"
"Bachelors Grove Truly Haunted And Cursed","Illinois","Haunted Places","So a few reasons why I will never return to Bachelors Grove...

I used to go there all the time with my friends and we would get the creepy feeling now and again but no concrete evidence to report. Afterwards odd stuff and some minor bad luck would happen to me for example car trouble, cat got a urinary tract infection (very healthy before hand), breakups - things that I did not associate with the cemetery as a source of this bad luck.

 One time I took my boyfriend and his friend there and it was the first time I had seen a shadow figure crawl up a tree around 3:30 in the morning. My boyfriend had scared the crap out of me as I was staring at the tree intensely and he came up behind me and grabbed me and I started whipping him with my flashlight. This almost ended our relationship that night. My boyfriend didn't see the figure but his friend did out of the corner of his eye so they both kind of thought I was losing my marbles. So that night ended and about a week later our dog got sprayed by a skunk and a month later our cat died from unknown causes. We had spent thousands and thousands of dollars trying to figure out what went wrong but he ended up having kidney failure so had no choice but to put him down. Still wasn't convinced this place was the cause of it.

 A few months later in September I took my cousin and video taped everything and we caught an orb going right through her and I had my evp recorder going but turns out it was all silence nothing got recorded. After this adventure I would get sick a lot with the flu or head colds and my cousin felt like something came back home with her. Her cat would hiss at her home at nothing. Eventually it stopped.

 Then I took my family there about a year later on October 17th 2015, and that was an eventful night. I took pictures but didn't catch anything but I had my evp recording the whole time and we caught some stuff. We heard ""get out"" ""leave"" some laughter. My aunt was super fatigued and dead weight during all this to the point my dad at to carry her out. She was telling everybody ""let's go I'm not feeling good"", and my cousin is arguing with her and then a voice on the recording that said ""Die!"" I replayed this over and over with my family and everyone was creeped out.

 A few months go by and my mothers health starts to decline, she suffers a couple minor heart attacks, 7 strokes and her life ended exactly one year later on October 17th 2016. And still I didn't put the puzzle pieces together and went back there a couple more times. My husband and I had gotten pregnant in August of 2017, I didn't know it at the time, when I'd gone to the cemetery but a couple weeks later I had a miscarriage.

 The final time I went back to Bachelors Grove was in October around my mom's death anniversary. I became suicidal and ended up in the hospital on psych hold. When I returned home, I went back to my evp recording and seen the date of October 17 2015 and every single hair in my body stood up and I felt cold as ice. This all makes sense now and f*** that place. Beware, it is not worth it. Leave those poor souls alone. And I'd like to also mention, everytime I visited that place I was respectful and I always put something on the infant daughter's grave."
"A Haunting","California","Haunted Places","One day I bought a 3 bedroom house for my son and myself to live in. I was divorced and raising my son alone. At the time my son was about 8 years old. The house was nice with a pool. I used one bedroom for my office. It had a hall and 2 bathrooms. After about a month or so, I started hearing the toilet flush. It would do it quite often. I thought that's weird since no one else was in the house but me. My son was at school. So one day when it flushed, I looked in the toilet and the water wasn't moving. It happened every day. There was just the sound of the toilet flushing, that's all. I called a plumber and asked him if it is possible for a toilet to make a flushing sound. He said not unless you live in an apartment. 

 One day I was doing my chores when I heard a 'clicking' sound. Like a light switch being turned on and off. It would go click-click. The sound came from my kitchen. So I went to my kitchen. Then the clicking sound went into the hall. I ran to the hall. Then the sound went into my living room. I ran into my living room. Then the sound came from my kitchen again. I ran into the kitchen. This 'thing' had me running all over the place. It went click-click. Just then my phone rang. I answered the phone and I noticed that the 'thing' just 'clicked' in the hall while I was on the phone. It didn't move around. All the time I was on the phone it just kept 'clicking'. But it got louder. It kept clicking louder and louder. When I ignored it, it went 'click-click' real loud. Then nothing. It was silent. I knew then that I had been playing with a Spirit. I was scared. 

 I had the house just about 6 months and I decided to sell it. That was quite an experience. I had never lived in a haunted house before. But I will never forget it. I talked to a minister about it and he said it had been a Demon. Scary stuff."
"1 Last Cut","Missouri","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I was in beauty school spring of 2015. It was normal day, when a client walks in the door they sign in, and the receptionists brings a slip back with the client's name on it and what service was needed. I get my slip, I walk to the seating area and I hollar out ""Larry"". A little old man gets up and walks to my station, basic haircut. He never said 1 word to me. I finished his haircut he got up laid my tip on my counter and left.

 Next day I was off of school I'm sitting at home reading the news paper. I turn the page and there is LARRY. It broke my heart, I yelled at my boyfriend ""awww babe I cut this guys hair yesterday and he died."" My boyfriend just brushes it off like ""o'well""

I started reading the obituary and it said HE died 2 Days before I cut his hair. I was in tears like with just happened moment. Then I started thinking maybe they got the days mixed up which doesn't happen a lot. But maybe it did this time. I was so confused. I couldn't explain it. I literally was at a loss for words.

I cut it out the paper and took it to school the next day asking everybody if they remember him, no one paid enough attention. So I go to my school owner and have her pull the school's sign in sheet and what do you know, there it is, the name LARRY no last name. Just Larry. I was so shook I even made my teacher cry when I told her what was going on.

I physically touched this man. Not to mention at this time I lived in a town 15 miles north of Larry's hometown and had to drive through his town to get to school. I am going to assume he just needed 1 last cut before his holiday in the sky. What do y'all think?"
"Silent Playmates","North Carolina","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I was just a little girl in the first grade when this experience happened. I was laying in bed trying to fall asleep. My mom didn't turn the night light on for me like she usually does, but there was enough light that I could see through the crack of the door. I could see a tiny blue light in the hallway on the wall at the top of the ceiling. I didn't understand why it was there?

All of a sudden I saw a little girl around my age and a little black dog?! I was so scared, they were just a few feet from the side of my bed. She was just skipping or dancing around back and forth on the side of my bed as her little dog followed, jumping up on her legs. I kept starring with the blankets up to my chin. It was too warm and I was sweating.

I was struck by how you couldn't hear one sound as she jumped around with her dog following after her. There was just enough light in the room that I could see she looked so happy, she was smiling, but I was still so afraid, I couldn't understand WHY she was there?

I don't remember falling asleep, but when I woke up I told my mother all about it at breakfast. She told me it was just a dream. Then I remembered the small blue light in the hallway up at the ceiling. I walked over to take another look, but nothing at all was there. I just went on to school having an ordinary day.

It was night time again and I was in bed ready to go to sleep. All of a sudden there was that little girl with her black dog again! The whole thing just repeated itself same as the night before. I didn't say a word to anyone about it the next day. The tiny blue light in the hallway was there again too. On the third night she didn't return, I never saw her or the little dog and the blue light ever again."
"1750s Horror Home In Historic Massachusetts","Massachusetts","Haunted Places","NOTE ON CHRONOLOGY: I refer to everyone in this story as what they are to me now: stepdad, and stepbrother, even though at the time they were family friends. It makes it much easier to tell the story. 

My mom and my stepdad married just one year ago, but we have known him for many years, since I was 5. When we met him, he had just moved into our town with his now ex-wife and son, and purchased an old home located in a remote part of town. It was one of the oldest homes in the area, having been built in the 1700s by a sea captain, had been passed down through that family for the next 200 years. When my stepdad purchased it, it had been deserted for many years and was in poor condition. Yet, with significant renovations, it looked good as new.

The house was L-shaped, with the main part of the home being the original two-story construction, and then a separate one-floor addition on the back of the house which contained the living room, kitchen, and back office room and bathroom was added in the 1800s. The first time I visited the house, my stepdad took us on a tour. The newly-remodeled living room and kitchen were beautiful, with new wooden floors and a large fireplace. This part of the home had a distinctly warm ambiance. That atmosphere instantly changed when we entered the oldest part of the home, toward the front. I cannot explain what was different or why I felt anxious, and I cannot point to anything tangibly distinct about that part of the house that justified that feeling. Still, a feeling of anxiousness originated deep inside of me and every hair on my body stood on end, especially in the upstairs hallway and near the staircase which was narrow, claustrophobic, and with a very low ceiling. And the whole front and upstairs of the house just felt... Dark. Even with many windows around, it felt shrouded in darkness. The floors were a very dark wood, and most of the walls were painted either blue or crimson. At the time, I wrote it off as my nerves getting the better of me and having read too many ghost stories in my spare time. 

Still, there was something inexplicably creepy about parts of the house. Everywhere I went, I felt that there were entities I could not see staring me down with a menacing gaze. I was afraid to open any doors because of the innate feeling there would be something right behind them waiting to jump out at me. I felt exactly the same way turning corners into other rooms, and I felt as if I was going to be grabbed from behind by something unseen. It was like I just KNEW there was something there, and it was aware of, and anticipating, my presence. Everywhere I went in the front part of the house, I felt I was being followed or chased. If I was in the front part of the house with another person and they left to go into the back of the house, the only area where there was any relief from this sensation, I would run as fast as I could after them. Being left alone in that part of the house felt like I was exposed and in danger. 

I visited the home probably once a week as a child, as my stepdad was then a good family friend. My now stepbrother is the same age as me, so we often played around the house and in the backyard. He never seemed to be afraid of the house, and always wanted to venture off into parts of it that I was uncomfortable going into. I remember specifically one time we were playing hide-and-seek, and he must have figured I would not feel comfortable searching upstairs. I searched the entire downstairs hoping to find him, hoping that I would not need to even go upstairs. Finally, I heard a rustling sound from the closet located under the stairs. I opened the door and shouted ""Found you!"" but to my shock and horror, there was no one there. The closet was almost empty, with the exception of one or two jackets. I knew for a fact I had heard noise coming from there! Too shaken to venture upstairs by myself, I asked my stepdad to come upstairs with me and search for his son. As we were climbing the stairs, I heard a noise from the upstairs hallway, as if someone had bumped into the wall. I ran around the corner expecting to see my stepbrother, but he was not there... All that was there was an old rocking chair, which was slowly rocking back and forth on its own, with the sound of someone humming to themselves. There was no window nor draft and no one sitting in the chair. I suddenly felt short of breath and felt as if there was someone right beside me breathing down my neck. I KNEW there was something there that I could not see. I remember flailing my arms in all directions as if trying to swat whatever it was away, but there was no physical manifestation of this presence and that horrified me. I screamed and ran downstairs, and bumped right into my stepbrother, who came out from hiding under the sofa in the downstairs back room. As I clearly had not been able to find him, he got sick of waiting and ended the game. This was the VERY last time I went upstairs by myself, for many years. 

About a year later, due to my antisocial tendencies as a child, my mother insisted I sleep over the house so I could learn to make better friends with my stepbrother. The thought of staying overnight in the house petrified me, especially given that at the time my stepbrother's room was upstairs. The entire night leading up to bedtime, there was no otherworldly activity. They made me a nice dinner, we watched TV and music videos in the back of the house, and I felt content and at peace. This feeling, nice as it was, was short-lived. I begged them to let me sleep on the sofa in the back living room, even though it would have meant I would be alone in that part of the house, but they insisted I sleep upstairs because all the bedrooms were upstairs and it would make it easier to check on us if we needed anything. Also, there were two twin-sized beds in the room, so it made the most sense in terms of sleeping arrangements. I protested and protested, but with no success. I begrudgingly accepted that I would have a night of terror. As I was being put to bed I remember seeing my stepdad's ex wife shut the door to the upstairs bedroom, right at the top of the stairs, and turn out the light. 

Surprisingly, I fell asleep quickly, but did not stay asleep. I woke up in the middle of the night and immediately noticed the room was much darker than it should have been. Usually, even at night, once your eyes begin to adjust you can see what is around you and sense the light coming in from the moon outside. My eyes just could not adjust and the darkness was overwhelming. I immediately could sense that there was something in the room with me that I could not see, and I could hear deep breathing sounds emanating from the darkness. I turned and looked over to my stepbrother's bed and he was not there, which meant I was ACTUALLY alone and he wasn't the one making the noises. I heard footsteps in the upstairs hallway, and assumed that my stepbrother had gotten up to use the bathroom and would be right back. What felt like an eternity passed, and he did not return to the room. I hid my head under the covers trying to hide from whatever unseen entity was there, but eventually I got so scared that I got out of bed and darted down the stairs at full speed, in the dark, trying to get away from whatever was there. I distinctly could tell I was being followed as I heard thump, thump, thump down the stairs behind me, as if there was someone following closely behind me and breathing right down my neck. I ran through the downstairs hallway, through the old dining room, and was ready to cross into the back of the house and slam the door behind me and turn on all the lights when I ran right into the door. That door was NEVER kept closed, so I was not expecting it to be shut and I could barely see it was there! The sound immediately woke up my stepdad, who turned on all the lights and ran to me in a panic checking to see if I was injured. I was hyperventilating and panicking, shouting that there was someone in the house who was following me and chasing me. I could barely get the words out. He assumed I meant an intruder, and checked every corner of the house top to bottom and found no one. Still, seeing how panicked I was, he allowed me to sleep on the downstairs sofa for the rest of the night. 

As I got older, I became less afraid of the house, but I still refused to be alone upstairs and the feeling of there being people or entities surrounding, following, and watching me never subsided. Other times I heard sounds coming from other parts of the house even when no one was there... Music playing that had no source and sounded like it was from a past era, voices calling out my and other people's names, footsteps, and items being banged around and knocked off tables. I never investigated the sounds and whenever I would point them out to another person, they would stop. Everyone was convinced it was all in my head and I was the only person hearing the noises. 

They moved out of the house when I was about 12, and the owners that bought it next lived there until 2016. When the house was on the market in 2016, the realtor had an ""open house"" and anyone could come by and walk through it. I walked through the entire house. It had been remodeled, and the walls were now all painted white, and the windows had been replaced and were now much larger and more modern. Somehow, these modifications made the home feel much less menacing. I could still sense a presence, but it did not feel as menacing. I wandered away from the tour group and stood upstairs in the hallway, held out my arms, and said aloud ""If there is anyone here, reveal yourselves to me."" Nothing appeared, and I didn't honestly expect it to, but I felt a slight breeze whisk by my face, down the hallway, causing the curtain on one of the windows to rustle, and it was gone as quickly as it came. In the moment, I felt as if whatever presence was there had recognized me from childhood and was affirming to me, finally, that it was not going to harm me. It felt like closure. 

After a recent conversation with my stepbrother, he admitted that he felt the same things I did when in the upstairs of the house but that he had tried to pretend to be brave and never made his experiences known, but that eventually the presence felt too strong and menacing that he moved his bedroom to the downstairs back office. My stepdad's ex-wife also moved her room downstairs, both due to the feeling of a sinister presence upstairs and the dissolution of her marriage. My step dad claims he had no experiences in the house, but he said he felt a ""chilling"" feeling upstairs, where hairs stood on end. He attributes it, though, to social conditioning, and the expectation that a house of that age would have spirits. He is not a believer and refuses to reconsider his stance. It was incredibly validating to hear that I was not the only one experiencing this, because for years everyone had pretended I was, and no one believed me. It turns out that they experienced many of the same things I did, but did not want to tell me at the time because they did not want to scare me.

We still communicate with my step dad's ex wife, she is a good friend to this day. She confided some of her own experiences. One time, she was downstairs late at night and heard the sound of someone, or something, tumbling down the stairs. She ran in a panic assuming my stepbrother had fallen, but when she got to the stairs, there was nothing there. She says this was, by far, the most unnerving experience she had in the house. Another time, after she had moved her bedroom downstairs, she heard footsteps coming into her room from the front hallway and the sound of a marble rolling across the floor. The sounds were right in front of her, but she could not see anything there. In the morning she had searched for anything that could have made the rolling sound on the floor but there was nothing. No marble, pen, pencil, or coin. These experiences stay with her even to this day. 

There is legend that about 150 years ago, a woman was murdered by her husband on the staircase, who came from around the corner and pushed her down the stairs in the middle of a heated argument. This story has neither been confirmed nor denied."
"Creepy Floaty Faced Thing","Idaho","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","This is another incident where I am reaching out in trust to my fellow YGS readers for your insight or speculation as to what in actual heck happened. Likewise, it probably is not scary to read, but it was bizarre and frightening when it happened. I have shared one other incident, which happened here. I will set the scene, in case you haven't read it.

When I was 18 I shared a flat in Boise's historic Warm Springs neighborhood with two of my younger brothers. The house we lived in was old for the area, divided into our upstairs apartment and our neighbor's below. We were smack dab between a hospital, the old Idaho State Penitentiary, and the Old Fort Boise cemetary, a few blocks or so from what is left of historic downtown Boise and the tunnels where Asian immigrants were forced to trade. Plenty of history roaming about. 

We all loved that house even though it's odd division mean that our ""living room"" was formerly an upstairs porch, complete with a front door and windows which opened into the main house. The porch had been closed off with more windows all along the 3 outer walls. We rallied some milk crates, a boom box, a hideous pink rescue couch, and a posh, velvety, spinning, 1970's, thrift store rocker/recliner. We tacked up a few yards of gauze as curtains and considered ourselves smartly furnished. 

 The only way the couch really fit into the narrow room was along a shorter wall, facing the length of the room and three walls of windows. The rocker we put in the middle just even with the door, beneath the front set of windows. It was humble, but homey, in the way only a grubby punk bachelor pad can be.

One warm autumn day, I came home from work to find my brother's girlfriend K waiting for him. She was sitting on the couch, so I plopped in the rocker and chucked off my shoes. It was sunny and hot and we did not say much. Just listening to music and smoking cigs. We did not know each other real well, either, so we were just kind of both awkwardly waiting for the guys to come back. 

Lazy and sweaty from biking home... I was shoving the rocker slowly side to side, back and forth, pushing with my stocking feet on the windowsills. Several times as I came around the ""back"" side I imagined that I saw a grumpy little wrinkly face staring into the sunny upstairs window. As that is impossible, I assumed tricks of contrast or reflection and just kept rocking back around.

Then I had to stop and stare out the window. Floating away from the window and turning to my left was a clear or pale, very skinny, small, wizened figure with the face of a grumpy old person. It had like a ruffle nightcap, like Little House on the Prairie. The figure was very small, maybe two feet. It glided with its arms drawn up stiffly, gnarled fists at at chest level. It sort of clouded and trailed off at the waist. I could not even believe what I was seeing. It stared straight ahead, unhappy, so I turned away with a childish hope that it had not ""seen"" me. I had goosebumps all over, sitting in the sun.

I sort of mentally chastised my wild imagination and just kept sitting there quietly with K. The last thing I wanted was to make things more awkward. Then out of the blue she's like ""did you just now see that banshee behind you in the window?"" It had looked sort of like the banshee in Darby O Gill. She had been watching it float outside behind me.

Freaking out, we both described seeing basically the same thing as one another. She was in tears. We went downstairs and sat outside until my brothers came home. K was still very upset, and one of our friends (army medic) treated her for shock. As far as I know, neither of us has ""the sight"" but she was young and troubled. I did not know then, that that age can be sort of a magnet for weird energy.

Other weird, unrelated things happened at that house. Before and after, my brothers heard footsteps in the empty kitchen on the other end of the house. They did not tell me until years later, or that at our neighbors house one could sometimes hear laughing or a party-the house had been a brothel. I don't think what K and I saw was an actual banshee, but I cannot say if it was a ghost, or what. It was so small. Wouldn't a person ghost be person sized? It did not seem like it was trying to get in or be seen."
"He Hears And Sees Us","Oregon","Misc","This past Sunday I was watching TV when the 700 Club came on.

It's a Christian broadcasting network that I never watch really, but I was busy around the house and just left it on that channel.

During the show they will ask people if they would like to join in Prayer for other people and yourself if you have a specific 

Problem. Everyone was told to put their hands on the part of the body that is causing them pain and we will all pray together. I DO have an issue with my neck which I've had surgery on. 

So I just stopped what I was doing, closed my eyes and put my 

Hands on the back of my neck. I asked God first to please help

Ll the hurting people in the world, then asked Him to please help me with the shooting pains that I get in my neck.

 When it's over the man on the show starts telling people what they prayed about, and the first prayer he mentioned was ""the lady with the shooting pains in her neck!? God has heard your prayer and you are healed!""

I just stood there staring at the TV and could hardly believe my ears... That was the first prayer he mentioned! He said not to 

Dwell on it anymore, not to worry, so from now on I won't. 

I don't go to church anymore and am not a religious fanatic, but I DO believe there is something out there watching out for the good of us all so I still pray. I still believe in the power of prayer!

I wrote this story last summer and am still amazed each time I read it. The host of that show said the lady with shooting pain is going to be alright. I'm not by any means trying to push religion. But it's just too far fetched also for me to ever believe it was a coincidence."
"Boot Steps","California","Haunted Places","Christmas 1993, I went to stay with my then best friend; Teri. She and her parents had been given a place to stay for a bit. It was a house down the old highway in Nevada City California. This house still had everything from its previous tenants, even a fridge that had been unplugged for who knows how long that still had some food in it. 

 Teris' parents were bikers involved with the Hells Angels and would rarely make an appearance at home. Being 16 having that sort of a set up seemed really ideal at that time. We got to come and go as we pleased. Sure we starved most of the time, but hey, we had the life (not really).

 I became curious as to what had happened to the previous occupants and so I asked her if she knew. The story was that there had been a family in the house and a violent fight broke out between the man of the house and some other guy. The two ended up out on the porch and the other guy shot the family man dead. I didn't believe her and to prove it she took me out to the porch (which was a wrap around) To show me where the bullet had exited the man's body and took a chunk off the swing gate of the porch. Sure enough there was a chunk in the gate. I immediately felt freaked out by the whole thing. But it certainly explained why everything was still in place and how her parents came in possession of the house.

 Teri decided to take it even further, by telling me that people had claimed to hear the man's boots walking the porch and he had even been seen a couple times.

 I felt extremely uncomfortable staying there after knowing all this, so we would do our best to stay gone from there. We slept there only twice, showered once, ate ramen only once and decided to get into the christmas spirit during that duration. There was a bunch of stacked up boxes in the living room, left from the unfortunate family. In those boxes there was some Christmas decorations. Being that time of year and with having no one around to get the place feeling festive, we decided that we would put up some of them ourselves. When we finished we took a seat on the couch. While we were sitting there we started talking about the ghost and wondering whether or not we would get to hear his boots, that's when the living room light began to dim. It dimmed a little and then a little more, until the room was dark. I became a little scared by this and we sat there in the dark silently listening. Then we heard it, the boot steps out on the porch. They paced down the porch a ways and then stopped. Teri jumped up and ran to the light switch, turning it on. We thought it would be best to call it a night and headed to the bedroom.

 We were laying there discussing the boot steps we had heard, then we hear something crawling around in the attic above us. We told ourselves it was mice, but it had to have been some BIG mice to make such loud sounds.

 The following day, we decided to leave the house. Before doing so I thought it would be a good idea to shower and eat. Turned out not being the case. The entire time I was in the shower I felt like someone was watching me, an overwhelming feeling of danger sunk through me. I took a very quick shower. Afterwards I decided to cook some ramen on the stove, since I hadn't eaten in a little while. In this kitchen, covering all the counters, were random dishes stacked and next to the stove was a round table also stacked with dishes. I was standing there cooking the noodles when I heard a little ping, ping sound. The type of sound that you might hear if a water drop hit a dish. So I look around to see the source of this mysterious noise. I see nothing, so I go back to staring at the noodles on the stove. Again I hear it; ping, ping and more pings. Until there was a non stop of pinging. When I look to my right in the direction of the table against the stove, I see the source of the sound. It appeared to be maggots falling from the ceiling. But there was no way they could be falling from there as there was no hole or anything, but here they were rapidly falling into the stacked dishes. I ran out out into the living room to grab Teri to show her what was happening, and when we got back into the kitchen there was nothing there. We ended up leaving the ramen sitting there and vacating that house for a couple of days. 

 After that I returned home and Teri and her family had relocated once again."
"Jensen Street","Idaho","Haunted Places","The house we raised our kids in was built in 1907 and so I'm sure it had a rich history. But it's old charm is what drew us to it in the first place. 

 We knew we were not alone after one of our first nights in the house. Sitting at the breakfast table, the kids asked us why were were running up and down the stairs all night.

 We lived in the house for a duration of seven years and so there were a lot of strange things that took place.

 I had been all too familiar with these sort of things and so it didn't concern me one bit, and I certainly didn't want to feed into the kids fears. I would simply play it off as it being an old house and such.

 We hadn't been living there very long when my husband and I got our first taste of our 'roommate '.

 It was late at night and the kids had all been tucked in, and we were settling in for the night ourselves, when we hear a very loud thump just outside our door in the living room. Assuming it was one of the kids misbehaving, my husband quickly popped the door open. We were shocked to see that the house was still pitch black and there were no kids to be seen. When he went downstairs to check on them, they were all sound asleep.

 Sometime later I had a friend over and she and I had gone into my bedroom, I noticed right away that the door to the master bath was shut and found it odd because the only people who used that bathroom were my husband and myself. When I attempted to open the door I found it had been locked. Thinking that someone was obviously in there I called out. There was no answer, so I called out again; still no answer. I then heard what sounded like the shower curtain being moved. 

 I decided I would go and grab the key to see who was in there, so I walked over to the closet and by the time I walked back to the bathroom door it was cracked open. I threw the door open and taunted whatever was in there by saying "" get out of my bathroom "".

 On another occasion while my husband and I were watching television, we heard the back door open and slam shut. We assumed it was one of our kids just coming in as they always did, so we yelled out "" don't slam the door "". There wasn't a response. My husband went down to confront them, only no one was there.

 One night in bed, husband snoring logs as usual. And I laying there not being able to go to sleep, I suddenly felt as if we were not alone. I distinctly heard shuffling in the carpet. I tried nudging him, but he wasn't waking. I quickly turned on my side and pulled the blankets just below my eyes. I was facing the window and it was winter time and this window always had a draft. I could feel the icy cold air from the window on my face, and I could hear the shuffling travel to my side of the bed. Again I tried nudging my husband, but he was out. Then I heard the sound of lips smacking or being licked repeatedly, right next to my face and then a very hot type of wind on my forehead.

 We had decided to remodel the down stairs and during the renovation, the frame began to leak. While my husband was outside repairing the leak and the downstairs was gutted, we told the kids not to go downstairs. I had been doing laundry this particular day, going back and forth from the laundry room that was down in the basement to the upstairs. 

 I noticed every time I was returning back to switch a load one of the bedroom lights in the basement was on, so I would turn it off. It kept happening, so naturally I got upset and went outside to tell everyone to stay out of the basement and to turn off the lights when they're done. The kids had gone down to the playground to play and my husband hadn't gone into the basement.

 We had to complete a course in order to get our house refinanced, and were mailed certificates for doing so. I had a spot where I kept all the mail and important papers, and I stuck those certificates in that very spot. I know I did and I saw them daily, right where I put them. There they remained for a couple weeks, until we needed to present them to finalize our refinance. Husband asked me to grab them, and so I went to do that and they were not there!

 I couldn't figure it out, I know where they were and they were just not there anymore. Doubting myself I began to think that perhaps for some reason I moved them, I began to tear the house apart searching for them. They were nowhere to be seen and I felt like I was losing my mind. But deep down inside I know where they had been.

 We gave them up for lost and ordered another set. It took a week or so to get the new certificates. Just like before I set them right where I set all the mail. When it came time to present the certificates, just like the time before they were gone!

 Now I really began to feel nuts, once again I tore the house apart looking for the second set. Not finding them.

 I sit down in a chair in the office, ready to give up. I looked over at a mirror leaning against the wall and could see an envelope poking out from behind it. Sure enough it was the certificates, only it was the originals I had first lost. The new ones were still missing.

 I can't tell you how badly that whole thing made me feel, I knew that something was playing a prank on me. A little while later I found the second set of certificates just sitting on a shelf out in the open. 

 Those were probably the most eventful things that took place in that house. Not much really, just thought I would share anyway."
"My California Ghost Stories","California","A Haunted Life","Story 1

When my sister was about 9 years old, she was alone in my room praying her rosary. Suddenly, she heard the sound of books from my bookcase falling to the floor although none actually did and the room turned red. She ran out of my room and unfortunately, that was the last time she ever prayed the rosary. I believe it was the devil scaring her commitment to her faith out of her. 😢

Story 2

Within a couple of hours after he died and the night before I even found out, I was watching a movie and felt my ex-BF's presence watching me from the window next to me. It was an eerie but strong feeling that I couldn't shake. Suddenly, his spirit flew along the outside of that side of my house, knocking loudly along the walls and windows before flying off. I didn't know what to attribute it all to until the next day when I found out that he had died while I was having dinner before the movie. I believe that it was him saying goodbye.

Story 3

Not long after my cat died, I was on the couch watching TV when I heard and felt the distinct sound of a cat jumping from the couch back to the cushion next to me. I thought it was my other cat but she was asleep on top of the couch. I believe that it was my Dusty saying goodbye.

Story 4

I was in the shower when I heard 3 hard knocks on the bathroom door. I was home alone.

Story 5

We had just moved in the day before and were sitting on our bed. The closet door was open. Suddenly, my dog stood up, stared into the closet and started shaking, growling while breathing in as well as out, and her hackles went up. She seemed scared. 

Story 6

I was at work with just one coworker in the room and I heard two voices whispering right next to me and one of them said my name. It was not my coworker.

Story 7

The basement of my workplace was rumored to be haunted by voices and sure enough, when I was down there alone, I heard voices next to me.

Story 8

At work, a coworker told me that he saw me go into the restroom. He then turned around and saw ""me"" coming down the stairs and said, ""Wait! Didn't I just see you going into the restroom?"" He said that ""I"" smiled slyly at him and said, ""Maybe."" He didn't tell me about that until a few years later when we worked at another place together again and we were having a relaxing moment with other coworkers, hanging out after hours before leaving. We were talking about the supernatural and I asked him if he'd had any experiences. He thought a moment and said, ""Yes! It was about YOU!"" My blood ran cold just then and as he told me what happened! We believe that he saw my doppleganger. 😨"
"More Than A Coincidence","California","Family / Friends Visits","I've often wondered about coincidences... Are they really? Someone once told me there are no accidents or coincidences. This made me reflect on past memories. One my mind keeps going back to is of my aunt. We were only 9 years apart so she insisted that I call her by her first name. She was so much fun with a witty sense of humor. She was my favorite aunt out of the 3 that I had.

When I left North Carolina with my grandmother for California she's who we stayed with. She had left the south and joined the army and was living there at the time. It really was a culture shock for me because now I was in a big city and I was just a small town country girl. My aunt took me everywhere. We went to Disneyland and I never wanted to leave, I loved it. She took me to the Anaheim baseball stadium and many Roller Derby games. She was really in to that. With her help I was able to settle in to city life. All was going well.

Then the phone call came, my aunt was dead from a brain aneurysm at the age of 28. My world crashed, she was the main adult in my life that ever took me places and showed she cared about me except for grandma. Her death left a void in my life that no one could ever fill. No one told jokes like her or could make me laugh so hard, I missed her so much!

Which brings me to coincidences. A year after her death some friends wanted to go hang out at this apartment building. I didn't know who the people there were but went along. I was stunned when we pulled in the parking lot. It was the apartment building my aunt lived in when I had left the south to stay with her! Memories came flooding back as I got out of the car and slowly started walking up the stairs. I couldn't believe we were also walking into the same apartment as well. What are the odds of that?! I don't remember a thing said or who we met that day, in my mind I was reliving some of the happiest times I ever had with my aunt. I could feel her presence there and got goosebumps.

Fast forward ten years later. I was in this city I didn't know well. My car broke down and there were no phone booths around, just a bus stop so I went and sat on the bench. No one had cell phones that I knew of in the 70's. I figured I go to my cousins house, he'd help me with the car. I must have sat there well over an hour before I realized no bus was ever going to come. I got really depressed and didn't know what to do. As I got up from the bench and turned around I realized I was at Rose Hills Memorial Park where my aunt had been buried?! I didn't recognize it when I sat at the bus stop. It has a huge brick wall around it. 

I walked through the gate and up to my aunt's grave and began to cry. I told her I was so lonely without her, and that I was stranded and didn't know what to do. I apologized for not having any flowers for her. I touched all the letters on her grave and told her how much I loved her and hoped to see her again someday. Then a calmness came over me as I got up to leave. I just started walking down the road to where I didn't know. I turned a few corners without thinking about where I was going and there was a phone booth! I was so happy to have stumbled on it, what a coincidence... Or was it? I like to think my aunt showed me where the phone booth was and she was at the old apartment building we once shared. It was meant for me to go with my friends that day so I'd know she was thinking of me too. I'm convinced there are no accidents or coincidences after all."
"Demonic? Principalities? And A Lost Cc - A Year Later","Nebraska","Pets / Animals","I know it's been a year and I vanished suddenly, but I have a very good reason. If you all remember I'd picked up/was under attack by, a very malevolent entity. My mentor, a man sent to me by my brother, instructed and assisted me to free myself. The rituals/prayers/cleansing were very intense, every night and every morning. They lasted just over a year. Another of his instructions was to avoid anything that might give the entity the ability to draw energy from me and the people around me. He asked what I might be doing to draw the being to me and feed it. This forum was one of the things I mentioned. He said to avoid it until such a time as the creature was completely gone, as remembering and putting things that put pain or fear into the forefront of my mind might embolden or strengthen it. That is why I vanished suddenly. I made other changes in my life, and cultivated a simpler, more organic lifestyle.

I am happy to say the entity is finally gone. I believe I am free of that entity and if something similar comes calling I know I have the strength to deal with it. 

However, I am devastated by the final cost of my freedom. Everything has a price, that's what they say. But price rarely measure true cost.

About six weeks ago I could feel 'it' was almost gone. It was angry and desperate, and after several months of quiet, there was a waiting, gathering feeling of power, anger, rage around me. On that night, I was on my bed, reciting prayers and shivering because of the malevolence around me, when Leia, my 11 year old Basset Hound, leapt up on me and started growling and baring fangs at the air at the foot of my bed. Normally she whimpers and hides behind me when I have 'guests.' 

Not this time. She stood covering my body, tail in my face Feet on my thighs, and she was in full 'I will eat you' mode. Her jowls were drawn up, her teeth bared, and her whole body was tight, as if ready to spring into attack. The only movement in her was the vibration of a growl that would terrify any right thinking creature.

I should mention that although 11 years old, the normal life expectancy of a Bassett, she was in great shape. She ran up and down stairs like a pup, she frolicked in the yard, chasing (and catching) birds, squirrels, and rabbits.

The feeling of 'it' exploded. I felt like the air had suddenly been sucked out of my lungs. Leia screamed and reared up, froze for a second, then dropped to me, screaming. If you've ever heard a Bassett scream, you know it is horrifying. If you haven't - pray you never do.

From that moment on, I could not feel 'it' any longer. It was gone... But Leia, my beautiful Leia... After hours and hours of screaming unabated... We brought her to the vet as soon as he opened. The vet said she had fluid in her heart and lungs and that she was painfully dying from it. He said there was nothing we could do, and she was going to die very soon. We made the hard choice to have her sedated until she passed.

We know this wasn't an existing condition. We'd brought her in for a dental cleaning and checkup less than two weeks prior. No I firmly believe she took the attack meant for me. 

Since her passing I've looked for her, listened and felt for her. Not a hint. I hope that means she's at rest and out of pain. It feels done but the cost was very steep and I'll pay for a very long time.

I continue to listen for a snuffle-whine or maybe a far off bay as she chases bunnies somewhere beyond. My greatest fear is that she somehow traded herself for me and is now in pain being gripped by 'it.'

I ask the creator every day to look after all of my precious lost ones. I hope he's listening as hard as I listen for my dear ones.

"Unplugged Fan","Oregon","Haunted Items","Out of the blue we started hearing this strange noise when we'd go in the garage, the attic is out there too. At first I never thought much of it because it seemed far away. Maybe it was a weed eater or leaf blower. We never heard it before, it wasn't loud enough to be a chain saw which we do hear around here from time to time. We just stopped trying to guess and ignored it.

Then one day I needed something from the attic, so I pulled the rope to the wooden stair case that drops down to the floor and climbed up there. Once my head cleared the opening to the attic I stopped in my tracks frozen on the steps. That noise we've been hearing for weeks is coming from an old fan up there. Only thing is the fan doesn't work and never has since we've lived here. It's just dangling from an old rope and isn't even plugged in!? The fan was making this noise you would hear from an older fan, this one is metal and it was just whirling away but nothing was moving?! I just stood there staring at it for the longest time. Then all of a sudden it stopped. No more noise... Just dead silence. 

When my boyfriend came home from work I told him I had found the source of the noise. He asked me what it was? When I told him it was the broken fan in the attic his face turned white as a ghost. Stranger still is now that we know where the noise was coming from we have never heard it again.

I've been having ""happenings"" since I was a little girl. I just never know what to expect next. I often wonder if it's someone that I know who has crossed over and is trying to contact me. I hope some day to understand."
"Paranormal And Pregnant","North Dakota","Misc","So up until today I have wrote off all this as a coincidence. I am in my second trimester of pregnancy. We tried for years to get pregnant and lost multiple babies along the way. Since becoming pregnant, there have been a lot of weird things that make me think paranormal activity is happening. After today I have no doubt. So let me get into it.

Coincidence 1: My husband was super close to his grandmother growing up. Her name was Elizabeth and she tragically passed away of cancer before him and I ever met. I believe she has been the one making contact. I say this because we are expecting a little girl finally after years of struggling and her due date is my husbands grandma's birthday. Also I found out I was pregnant when I went in to be tested as I had abnormal cells that looked cancerous. This is not paranormal but definitely is a weird coincidence, especially since he prayed to her about it a lot having another child.

Coincidence two: Since being pregnant I have had multiple instances where out of the corner of my eye I see a little white haired person, but then I look and no one is there. This happens on the daily. I told my hubby about it and he said maybe it's grandma which I had never even considered because why would she appear to me and not my husband. I never knew her.

Final Coincidence: Me and my husband already chose a name for our little girl and everyone in our family knows this. Well today my father in law sent me a text that just said: ""Elizabeth middle name Last name."" I texted him back and reminded him we already have a name for the baby. To which he replied: ""what are you talking about."" I then sent him a screenshot showing that he had texted me that name. He sent back a screenshot of his screen and it appears he never sent a message on his phone. 

 I am convinced my late grandmother in law wants us to name the baby after her and is sending messages. I don't want to name the baby after her, but I am scared to anger her. 

Side note: She has found ways to reach us from beyond the grave in the past. For instance, she arranged for a letter to be read at my husbands wedding which occurred 15 years after she passed. He never knew about it until it was read at our wedding. Also the circumstances to which we were brought together were very strange and the birth of our first born is nothing more than divine intervention. Our first born defied many odds and came when we did not know we needed him. In many ways he saved us.

Anyways what are your thoughts? What could all this mean? Do you think she just wants us to know she's present?"
"The Bold Ghost","Pennsylvania","Non Human Entities","I should start by saying, this was not my first ghost experience, however, it was my most profound and definitive.

 My story starts in the summer of 2005. I had just turned 18 and graduated from high school. At the time my days consisted of working my job at the pizza place and spending almost all my free time with friends, as most kids do at that age. So when my boyfriend at the time, Dave suggested I moved in with him I couldn't of been more excited. It would mean independence for me.

 The apartment was SMALL. One bedroom, a bathroom and a kitchen/living room area. My boyfriend had gotten a great deal on the place 300$ a month, as our friends father owned the building and we would be living there during construction. I'm not really sure what the history of the building was before, but my friend's father guessed it was somewhere from 80-100 years old or so. Ours was one of only a few units in the structure which was more like a house.

 Flash forward to a few weeks in and we were having some friends over, having a little bit of booze and enjoying our freedom, but nothing too out of hand. There were four of us, myself, my friend Jackie, Dave, and his friend James. We had played some cards and walked around showing our friends the unfinished ""creepier"" parts of the building.

 I can recall the basement feeling odd when we went downstairs and my friend Jackie also commenting something along the lines of feeling watched. We sort of shrugged it off and went upstairs to my apartment and put on a movie in the bedroom.

 Jackie was laying on a couch I had in my room and James was on the floor on a blow up mattress, with Dave and I on the bed. We were all fairly tired at this point so the room had gone quiet. I was just starting to close my eyes when I noticed a dark shape out of the corner of my eye in the left, upper corner of the room. I focused in on it, straining to see what it was in the now dark room. At first I assumed that it was shadows being thrown from the television, but it still rattled me enough that I reached behind me and flipped on the light switch. When I turned on the light the dark shape was gone so I assumed that I had been right. But before shutting the light off I started to ask aloud ""does anyone else..."" I couldn't even finish before Jackie blurted out "" See that sh*t on the ceiling?!"" 

Feeling even more frightened now that someone else in the room acknowledged this, I waited about 15 minutes before shutting the light off. Another 10 minutes or so went by and just as before I was just beginning to let myself fall asleep, when I felt the overwhelming feeling of being watched. My eyes immediately shot to the corner where I had seen the shape, and sure enough, there in the corner was a dark, what now appeared to be moving, black mass. I shot up out of bed and flicked the light on. And to my shock and horror this time, the mass stayed.

 Now with all the lights on the shape was clearly visible to me. It was what I can only describe as a black swirling cloud with small tendrils like smoke coming off of all sides of it, round-ish if I could even call it a shape at all. It seemed to move and swell like the way water or smoke moves and almost had a vibration around it. It was was a hazy black mist although its center appeared solid. At this point every single one of us was seeing the same thing exclaiming our fear out loud. 

It was then that the figure started to slowly move along the top of the wall, picking up speed and going from corner to corner. I have never been so scared in my life. We all ran to the center of the room and huddled together, petrified by what was happening. 

 I began saying a prayer because it was the only thing I could think in the moment. So I said the Lord's prayer and as I was it seemed to get faster and faster, it moved so quickly now you could barely keep up with it. This went on for just about three minutes. Then just as mysteriously as it appeared, it traveled around the room one last time and sucked up into the crack above the closet door and disappeared. Needless to say we were all shaken to the core and did not sleep that night or turn off the light. 

 I am now 32 years old. Jackie and I are still friends and we still talk about this experience everytime we see one another. I also had other experiences after this initial experience and will probably submit more of my stories with this apartment. Not one single day goes by that I don't think about this spirit and what happened to me there. It has profoundly affected me. Whatever had presented itself to us that night was a bad energy. You could feel it, and my other experiences would prove it further down the line.

 Later, while fixing the bathroom wall (the wall shared with our bedroom) paper crosses were found stuffed inside the wall. Still not sure why, but most likely some kind of protection? Had this happened before? I eventually moved, and me and my boyfriend at the time went our separate ways. I never spent another day in that place by myself ever again. Anyways, thanks for reading my story if anyone has a similar experience feel free to reach out! Stay spooky and peace and love!

"Feeling Of Dread In The Middle Of Nowhere","Utah","Misc","Not sure if this qualifies as a ghost story...

In September 2013 me and a friend traveled to the US, to go on a road trip. I'd say about a good week into our trip, we had visited Zion National Park and were staying in a hotel close to the park, in Springdale. On our last day there, the weather was quite bad, definitely not fun to go hiking in. So we decided to drive to St. George to go shopping instead. My friend, being a guy, wasn't too thrilled about it, but he agreed there wasn't much else to do.

After spending the day shopping, we had dinner and then headed back to our hotel. It was about an hour's drive and it was dark already. I don't remember where exactly we were driving, but the road was deserted and the area was dotted with patches of mist here and there. It wasn't foggy though, visibility was still good. All of a sudden I got this feeling of dread and unease. I just felt like we needed to keep driving and get out of there as fast as we could. I never had such an overwhelming feeling that there was something wrong with that area. I just wanted to curl up in the fetal position and hide from the world. My friend was driving and I decided not to say anything, maybe it was all in my head?

The feeling lasted for a good 10 minutes and slowly disappeared as we got further away. As we got to the hotel I casually mentioned that that particular area freaked me out. To my surprise he said he had felt it too! He said: ""I don't know what it was but I felt so uncomfortable, like something evil would suddenly jump out at us. All I wanted was to get out of there as soon as we could.""

I was relieved it wasn't my imagination, but it did make me curious. I wish I had written down what exact road we were on, so I could do some research on the area. It's a long shot, but if anybody knows anything about the history this area between Springdale and St. George that could explain that feeling of dread, any feedback would be welcomed."
"Light Man","Louisiana","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I'm submitting this story on behalf of myself and older brother. The events described took place in Louisiana, rural Acadia parish. I was four years old, my brother not quite six years old. What transpired was real, not imagined, not a dream. It absolutely was not of this world.

I saw a man of pure white light. My brother saw a man of pure white light. I will refer to him as Light Man. We saw this man on separate occasions outside a window of the bedroom we shared. We don't know who saw Light Man first or how much time elapsed between the sightings. We do know that the sightings took place in late summer, August or September, 1960.

First, my sighting. I was asleep in my bed which was situated sideways against an open window. There was no screen on this window. I woke up, my head lying against the window sill. I don't know if something awakened me. My eyes briefly gazed up at the stars before I caught a glimpse of a man made of white light standing just to the right of the window. I was terrified. I pulled back slightly and stared at him for several seconds. His features were very well defined. Slender face, small nose, short hair. Average size eyes and ears. He was wearing a suit, i.e., shirt, tie, coat and pants. Everything was white light, but I could clearly distinguish between clothing and body. 

I attempted to scream for my mother, but I was so terrified that no words came out of my mouth. Then Light Man slowly began moving to the left, across my window. His head was tilted slightly backwards, chin slightly elevated. He stared straight ahead. I pulled even further backwards, away from the window, intently watching him. As soon as he slid past the window, I stuck my head out and watched him march towards the corner of the house. I use the word march because that's what he was doing. The legs of his stiff frame were goosestepping while his arms hung straight down, motionless. He marched until he reached the corner, then he made a crisp left turn and vanished.

At this point, I was finally able to scream for my mother. She came running, and I told her there was a man outside the window. She immediately assumed I'd been dreaming, but I adamantly insisted that this wasn't a dream. She suddenly became concerned that maybe someone had been at the window and took me by the hand, grabbed something like a rod or stick from the kitchen (I don't recall exactly what it was), and took me into the backyard, tightly clenching my hand.

We cautiously walked across the yard. And saw nothing. I told her Light Man had walked around the corner of the house. We did likewise and again saw nothing. At this point, she relaxed and insisted I'd been dreaming. We re-entered the house and she took me back to my bed. I begged her to let me sleep with her, but she refused because my 2 1/2 year old brother was already in her bed. I was hysterical but she didn't relent. She did close the window before walking off. I got in my bed, shaking, and pulled as far away from the window as possible. I lay there trembling until I fell asleep.

Now, my brother's sighting. He was asleep in the same room, also near a window. There was a screen on the window. He woke up one night and saw Light Man standing slightly to the left of the window. He watched as Light Man slowly walked past the window, head tilted back, chin elevated until he was out of sight. He didn't see the same level of facial detail, but it was the same left-facing profile, same mannerisms, same right to left movement that I'd witnessed. For some reason, he felt no fear and went back to sleep.

We had no air conditioning in our home, hence we slept with open windows. The house was in a very isolated location, with one neighbor about 1/2 mile away. There were no other neighbors for at least a couple of miles.

We never discussed what happened until it came up more than 20 years later while having pizza at a local restaurant. He had never breathed a word of what happened to anyone. I carried my secret for approximately 17 years before sharing it with the woman who eventually became my wife. My brother decided to share what he'd experienced with us. Before he finished his story, my jaw dropped as chills shot through my body. My wife and I stared at one another in disbelief. I then told my story and watched my brother's stunned reaction. We spent the reminder of the evening comparing notes and pinpointing the timeframe of the sightings.

For decades, we have shared our story with others, hoping to gain some understanding of what we saw and why it happened to us. We've learned nothing. Now, both in our 60s, we'd like more than ever to discover if anyone else has had a similar experience, or if someone can offer insight about these truly remarkable events. 

This story has been told exactly as it happened with no embellishment whatsoever."
"The Angry Red Man","Florida","A Haunted Life","I have some concerns... But to understand I should start at the beginning... 

When I was about 3-4 years old, my grandmother was messing with an ouija board around me. At one point there was a knock on the door and when grandmother checked outside nobody was there. I told her, ""there is someone. It's a man and he wants you to let him in."" My grandmother said no, quickly shutting and locking the door. The house suddenly felt like there was earthquake. She took the ouija board and burned it. I then start becoming sensitive to people's emotions and places of deep emotions / history. This happened in Dallas, Texas 1994

Fast forward to age 9. I was taken in by my other grandparents (parents were divorced and not taking proper care of me & younger sister) I was in my room, very upset as I didn't like the way everyone was treating me. A black mass in the shape of a dog of some sorts appeared. It told me it would be my friend, my strength, and the only thing I had to do was let it be a part of me. Well, kid me just assumed I had made an imaginary friend so I agreed. I continously saw an unknown figure throughout the house. That was between 1998-2008 Marietta, Georgia.

Since then I have had a strong connection with spirits / places, like I had become a magnet. But only one is really strong and has been attached to me. My exes and now husband have all claimed to see him in some sort of way. (2006-2009) 1st ex swore one time he saw a man of red hugging me and it caused my eyes to turn red themselves. (2009-2011) 2nd ex swore he saw the man of red several times in the house and he always seemed angry towards him. (2014) My now husband has dreamed of him, saying the man was standing outside of the house looking at him angrily. I never spoke of the man to any of them until they mentioned the encounters.

There are times I don't quite feel like myself, like I'm in a trance or in a dream. I have been told I talk in strange and different voice in my sleep. I had many strange and vivid dreams, especially after having my 1st child. The spirit doesn't seem interested in the children, but to my partners.

Can anyone give me any advice or suggestions?"
"The Green Light In The Room","Colorado","Orbs / Lights / Mists","This happened on August 18, 2019 at exactly 1:04am. As I am fully awake right now, at 2:04 am-exactly 1 hour after my green light experience. I was startled beyond belief as to what I saw an hour ago. Now I am calm as a bug in a rug. My mind and eyes fixated on the disappearing green light I just saw.

 3 hours before I saw the green light, I got ready for bed after my full shift at work. Tired and worn-out, I fell fast asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow. My Husband was already asleep beside me. Checking the clock on our nightstand it read,""10:02"". The next thing I remember, I awoke to a bright green light above my bed on the ceiling. My eyes automatically opened. It had a weird pattern of a green snowflake but very round in circumference. Feeling shocked by what I was seeing on the ceiling, I blinked my eyes to see if I was imagining this. The green light was still there for 5 seconds and it disappears before my eyes. No cars passing by at this ungodly hour. My curtains are fully closed and absolutely no light coming in. Laying still for 5 minutes, I gather my thoughts, get up and turn on the lights in our bedroom. My Husband wakes up and I try telling him what I just saw. He mumbles something incoherently and goes back to sleep.

 I am standing in the middle of our bedroom staring at the ceiling, wondering in awe of what I have just seen. Calmness fills my whole body. Was this my guardian angel visiting me? Perhaps so. I caught a glimpse of the Green light of my Angel. I prayed and thanked God for my beautiful green light. Amen."
"Busted Headstone","Idaho","Haunted Places","Most of my life I have experienced a lot of paranormal activity, just small little things that you notice but just accept. Because we do after all have to coexist with one another. However there are 5 particular incidents that took place, that I personally feel are note worthy. This is my # 4. 

 The year was 1994 and I was 17 years of age at the time.

 I was living in Pocatello Idaho with my ex husband's parents. The house was an older unfinished two story, that was situated on a dead end street. It was one among four others. My ex husband, whom was my fiance at this time, had gotten into some trouble with the law and was sent away for eight months. Because of my abusive situation at home, I had no other choice but to stay at my fiance's parents house. Honestly I would have rather stayed somewhere else, but my options were very slim.

 Around the fall of that year, one of the local cemeteries had been vandalized by a couple of teenagers. Several tombstones had been destroyed, including my ex husband's Grandfather's. To try and save a buck, my ex husbands father brought the pieces of the gravestone to his house and attempted to fix it. 

 It must of been a difficult task for him, because I recall seeing it sort pieced together in a makeshift wooden box just sitting in the basement in his work area.

 That was around the time I had my first encounter with what I'm assuming was my ex husband's Grandfather's ghost. It was late at night and one of the other teenagers that lived there had to go to bed for school in the morning and as they were leaving my room asked me if I wanted him to turn out the light on his way out. Not thinking much about it, I said it would be fine and with that he exited my room and the light went out. Here I was just sitting on my bed kind of letting my eyes adjust to the darkness and getting ready to climb into bed, when I hear a heavy thud at the other end of the room. I fixed my eyes in that direction to see what could have made that noise and was completely horrified to see a shadowy figure just standing in the moonlight. I wanted to run away, but was afraid it might lunge at me as I had to run right past it to get out of the room. It didn't have any facial features, but I just know it was looking at me.

 It didn't move or anything, it just stood there. I got the silly idea that perhaps if I simply slid into bed and turned my back to it, then it would go away. I was wrong! As soon as I did this, I could hear footsteps scurrying across the room and stop right next to the bed where I was laying. I could feel my heart begin to race. In a panic I pulled the blanket up over my head. I then heard it walk to the foot of the bed. I was absolutely terrified at this point and didn't know what to do. My heart was beating so fast and so hard I thought it might burst. In that moment I got yet another silly thought that if I was asleep, then this being would lose interest and go away. So I began to make snoring sounds. It didn't seem to be working because it was still there, I could hear it move it's feet at the end of the bed. But I persisted with the snoring sounds. I then felt the bed next to me sink in as if someone had climbed into bed with me. I remained under that blanket making snoring sounds, unsure of what was to come. I must of eventually fell asleep because I awoke the next morning and the thing was gone.

 At that point I was terrified to sleep alone in the room. It just so happened there was another girl also staying in the house that came to me and asked if she could stay in my room. This worked out perfectly for me. 

 I explained to her what had happened the night before and she became creeped out. We made a pact that if either of us ever had to use the bathroom in the middle of the night we would go together. She learned quickly that I was not making up my ghostly encounter on one of our nightly ventures downstairs to use the bathroom. She had gone into the bathroom and as I sat out in the living room waiting for her to return, I heard the door to the stairs leading to the basement open and close. I sat there listening and hoping for a sign that it was just my fiance's Mom making sure the house was secured or something of that nature. His Mom's room was down the hall from the door. So there I sat waiting to hear her footsteps, which would have been followed by the sound of her bedroom door closing. To my surprise, I heard neither. A few moments later the girl came back into the living room and asked me if I had shut that door to the basement. 

 As I was trying to tell her that I had thought it was her Grandma, we heard the door open and close once more. Followed by footsteps running down the hall and then stop right where we standing. Which happened to be an unfinished open staircase. We looked at eachother and took off running up the stairs, sort of pushing eachother out of the way. When we made it back into my room, we decided that we would try to hold our pee all night from now on. For the most part we were able to do this. 

 During the eight months that my fiance was away, I learned that his Mother had also been hearing things. Since I had that girl bunking with me and we would no longer venture downstairs at night things were pretty uneventful.

 There was another occasion when I had a friend stay over and my usual bunky was gone on this particular night, my friend had asked for something to drink and I didn't want to deny her a drink. We headed down to the kitchen and made some juice. I was standing there at the cutting board stirring the juice when we heard a low very deep groaning coming from the hallway. We look at each other and listen, and just like before, we hear the door to the basement open and close. I dropped the spoon right in the juice pitcher and begin to run for the stairs, my friend followed. Once we were in my room I told her all about the visitor I had before. For the remainder of the eight months nothing else really happened. My ex husband was released from prison and we got a place of our own.

 Ten years later, we were moving from Missouri to Boise and found ourselves passing through Pocatello very late at night and needing a place to stay. Naturally we ended up at his parents. It was an extremely long drive from Missouri to Idaho and we were exhausted. We took the room at the top of the stairs and put our kids in the room next to ours. 

 We were just about to settle into bed when we hear very loud, very slow footsteps ascending the stairs. We knew it wouldn't and couldn't have been either of his parents because they were older now and not as mobile as they once were. I thought it was our oldest boy returning from the bathroom and maybe stomping on his way back upstairs. So I asked my ex husband to pop the door open to tell him to be quiet, but when he opened the door there was nobody there. I had him go check on the boys and he told me they were fast asleep. We shut our bedroom door and once again the footsteps began. So he popped the door open once more and still no sign of anyone, but the footsteps were unmistakable. He shut the door one more time. Within moments the footsteps started up again, until they reached the landing outside our door. We sat there just listening and there was silence. Suddenly there was a faint tapping on the door, to me sounded like a kid's fingers. Convinced it was somehow our oldest boy we quickly popped the door open and again there was no one there. When he checked on the kids for a second time, they were still fast asleep. I was starting to feel uneasy and being reminded of the visitor I had when I was 17. My ex husband was just standing there with the door in his hand with a puzzled look on his face and I said "" SHUT THE DOOR!"" As he was shutting the door I watched the door be pushed in the opposite direction and out of his hand. He quickly grabbed hold of the door and shut it.

 That's when we could hear something running up and down the hallway hitting the walls as it went. We were tired, we needed sleep and we didn't have the money for a hotel room. So our only choice was to try and get some rest before we finished the drive to our destination. With the obnoxious noises just outside the door we proceeded to get into bed, when I started to smell a very rancid smell. It was awful, smelled like something rotten. I asked my ex husband if he could smell it, he could not. I certainly could. It seemed like the more I complained about it the stronger it became. Determined that it was a dead mouse we tore that room apart in hopes stop find the carcass. Never did find anything, but the smell persisted all night. When we woke up the next day, we drove out of there never to return again. Since then his parents have passed and the family replaced the Grandfather's headstone. I wonder if the new tenants have ever had a visitor?"
"More Things About My Late Husband","Georgia","Family / Friends Visits","I posted here about my experience with some old VCR tapes that I thought were doing some strange things, but neglected to mention all of the other things that have led me to believe, over the last 25 years, that my late husband, Scott, likes to communicate with me. First, he was a young Marine Corps aviator and was diagnosed with a brain tumor at age 27. We discovered we were expecting our first baby on the same day he had his biopsy, not a great day. But he had a lot to live for, so we didn't waste time being sad. In the five years he was sick, we had some great times despite his illness. We were not going to let it stop us from experiencing all the life we possibly could, even though sometimes it was very bittersweet. Yes, it's weird. There were a couple movies made about similar things way back in the 90s, but I swear I did not see them (as from the trailers they seemed to be putting my life on the screen, and yuck, I could never watch it!). We had our baby girl, and then had another about 17 months later, some might say an oopsie, but I say a gift from God. Scott had been doing great until the second girl was about ten months old, then had a recurrance of his cancer. He died when the girls were 2 and 4.

When they were babies and toddlers, the news was full of stories about how babies were being accidentally strangled by cords from mini blinds. Scott was always concerned about this as we had a brand new house with brand new blinds. He was always tying the cords up into his fancy Boy Scout knot (that you could pull on once and it would just fall out). I even have video of him tying up some blind cords during our daughter's first birthday party. 

After he died, the girls and I went about living our lives the best we could. I don't know exactly when I started noticing that the cords on our mini-blinds would sometimes be tied into the Boy Scout knots, but it probably was years later. It's like once I realized about these knots, I would discover them around the house all the time. I knew it wasn't me doing it, and immediately felt it had something to do with him! We've moved into three other homes since then, and it never failed, I would find the knotted blinds from the kitchen to the laundry room and even this last time I went to paint our garage walls (I know, who paints their garage, right?!) I discovered the old blinds in the garage window had the knots. It got to the point that I would untie them and start watching, and it seems like just as I would forget about it, there they would be for me to notice!

I remained single for 12 years, but after 9-11 an old friend of Scott's from the Marines was headed over seas and traveled through our town's airport on his way, calling me on a lark. We ended up dating (sort of long distance) and then planned a weekend together for when my daughters would be at camp. I was so excited, I was crazy about this guy. He had been Scott's boss at one point, and my husband had really respected and cared about him, though I had only met him a few times. Anyway, I'm getting my shower the Friday afternoon before he was scheduled to come into town for our first weekend together. As I walked out of the bathroom, I stepped on a sharp object and looked down to find my late husband's tiny aviator wings (that I kept in my jewelry box in the closet) impaled into the bottom of my foot. How had they gotten onto my carpeted floor?! I knew I hadn't gotten them out and the kids were out of town! I pulled them out of my foot and probably talked out loud to Scott! It was just like something he would joke about! Then, I realized I hadn't had a tetnus shot in years, so had to go get that shot the same day, just before my big date! Well, you know how tetnus shots make you feel... RUINED my romantic weekend! We joked that Scott was trying to tell us something, but we were only really half joking. Then, after a few months of dating, we were on the phone one night and my new guy told me he loved me. Just as I was answering the same, this tin flower holder -- think cute wall hanging -- that hung on my kitchen wall came crashing down onto the Mexican tile floor in the next room. It had never fallen before, and hasn't since. I just knew it was Scott, the timing was too amazing! 

Let me go back a minute... I forgot about the cemetery. When Scott and I first started dating, he was going to leave his truck with me while he went overseas, but I needed a refresher on driving a stick shift. We went to the cemetery to practice on the little roads there, and on this one hill, I jerked the truck and he spilled his coffee on his trousers, which we both laughed at. One day after his death, I was sitting by his grave and realized I had picked the gravesite directly adjacent to the place his coffee had spilled, without realizing it!

Then there were the rainbows. The scar on his head was an arch, and our oldest daughter used to call it ""Daddy's rainbow."" The day of his funeral, as we were driving home from my parents' house back to our little house, a double rainbow was in the sky and the first thing our girls said was, ""Look Mama, Daddy sent us a rainbow from heaven!"" I've been interested over the years to read of others who've lost people who saw rainbows on the day they died, especially plane crash victims. And oh yeah, for the next two years on the anniversary of his funeral, we saw rainbows!

Back to my second husband. We both believe that our being together was meant to be. I dated throughout my 30s and never met anyone at all that I even had a second date with. We both believe we were meant to be together and Scott had something to do with it. We think he approves. My new husband and I had two children together, and the youngest daughter, when she was about ten, had a dream in which Scott appeared just in time with a ""bunch of other military guys"" to save her from some ""bad man"" who was chasing her. As she recalled the dream to me, a man who looked like her older sisters' daddy (we still have photos of Scott, and she knows his story) helped her, then looked at her and said, ""You don't know me, but I know all about you!"" before getting in his ""big truck"" and driving away. When I heard this, it really struck me. Maybe it's because I want to think he does know about us all and what a happy ending we've had, and I also want to think he is a protector. If God has warriors in heaven, he's one of them!

Finally, about the night my mom died. This could be its own story, but I'll tell it here. We were very close to Mom, she was a fabulous mom and mother in law. She died after a very brief illness and we were all shocked at how fast she went down hill. The night she passed away, after only a week of her being sick, I was with her. She was heavily sedated, and I was just in that pre-sleep state across the room on a small sofa, but all of a sudden I felt someone wake me up, like a hug and then gone. I jumped up and ran to call my brother who was upstairs. I have to insert something strange, and I debated about leaving it out, but I'll tell you. I had gone through menapause a couple years earlier, for absolute sure, yet as I ran up the stairs to get my brother I realized I had gotten my period RIGHT at that moment! WHAT? I called my brother and he came down just in time for her last breath. Then, almost in that moment my phone rang. This was at 2 a.m. It was my new husband calling to tell me some other old Marine friend had JUST called our house, asking about Scott and insisting that he talk to me about Scott. I told my husband that Mom had passed almost at the same moment, and we both concurred that somehow it was a message that Scott was there for Mom, and he somehow used his other friend to let me know. When I finally talked to the other friend, whom we hadn't spoken to in years, he related how he'd been up with his own baby in the night and felt compelled to call me to check on things. He said he couldn't get Scott out of his mind. I realized after this that he was the one, during all the years I was single, who always knew to call me somehow to check on things when I was the lonliest. And he would say things like, ""We should get those girls into private school."" Which was confusing to me. Why would he say that? We weren't dating, just friends. But it makes sense to me now... Maybe that friend is somehow sensitive and Scott figured out how to somehow communicate through him? It sounds a little crazy. By the way, I told my doc about the period part and he was shocked. He feels it was a spiritual thing (and I applaud him for admitting that to me). Haven't had it since, by the way (apologies for TMI!) Anyway, these days, I feel that Mom and Scott are both around sometimes. In my heart, I hope it's like they can visit for special occasions, such as our daughters' weddings (I related a story about that somewhere else) but want them to be happily in heaven drinking martinis with everyone else! When they aren't keeping my little ones safe from ""bad guys"" in her dreams, that is! Thank you for letting me share here. This has been ongoing for the last 25 years. It's all good."
"Watching Us Sleep","Pennsylvania","Shadow People","I moved in with my boyfriend 1 1/2 years ago. We have been together 5 years now and are expecting our first child. He moved into this apartment before I joined him, after I relocated from Ohio. I was never really a fan of this place and he only chose it because during that time in his life he didn't have a car or many options- it was in a close proximity to where he was staying at that time in his life so it was easy for him to move here. The apartment needs a lot of repairs, is tiny and barely has storage. When he moved in there was still a bed from the previous tenant, as well as medications with Chinese writing and other items in the kitchen cabinets. 

I am a very sensitive person in general. Though I have never been plagued by hauntings I can be extremely empathetic and affected by energies. I have to spend a lot of time alone to re-center myself. When I first moved in here I was depressed but I write that off to relocating from a life where I was very independent and lived alone. This was something to get used to. I felt some bad vibes after a week of living here. After a few days of just being really bummed out I decided to throw away the remaining items from the previous tenant (luckily the furniture was removed before I even arrived,) and I decided to sage the entire apartment. After that, I kind of settled in. 

Fast forward, the only thing strange that really happened since moving in was I went through this short phase, at the end of last year, of waking up in the middle of the night because I have always had trouble sleeping. I would wake up between 12am-4am and go to the living room and fall asleep on the couch. One of these nights, I think it was 3/4am, as I was falling asleep on the couch the room smelled like my grandmother's perfume. My grandmother passed away in 2009. When I think back on it, I think it was around the time my son was conceived so I feel like that was her ""checking in"" because I had gotten pregnant. I hadn't had anything happen like that since. 

This brings me to a few weeks ago: My boyfriend had gone to use the bathroom and when he came out he said he was startled because he saw the shadow of a person at the end of the hallway, which leads to the living room. This was in the middle of the day. That kind of creeped us both out. 

A week later (two weeks prior to me posting this,) we were in bed. My boyfriend fell asleep before me and I noticed he was talking in his sleep, which he has done before but not in quite a long time. I eventually was able to fall asleep but a couple hours later I was woken up, suddenly, to the sound of him talking. We were laying down facing each other in the middle of the bed, when I opened my eyes and saw the shadow of a person right behind him. It was just the upper portion of a person. I saw a head, shoulders, chest, arms and hands that were resting on my boyfriend's side. No details. It looked like it was looking down on us sleeping. 

Since I have a hard time sleeping, and I was actually tired that night, I didn't want to acknowledge this thing and make a deal about it because I tend to freak myself out before bed when I read ghost stories from YGS. Haha. So, I asked my boyfriend ""are you okay?"" for some reason. I wasn't scared and I didn't feel any bad energy coming from this shadow. My boyfriend mumbled something in his sleep and I laid my head back down and dozed off again.

I haven't experienced anything like this before or since but two nights ago when he was working a second job, between 10pm-3am, I was trying to sleep. I was woken up to the feeling of being pushed. I looked at my cat and she was sleeping at my feet, undisturbed. I managed to doze off but I was woken up, again, to a much stronger push. After that I just turned Hulu on my phone and waited for my boyfriend to get home. I told him about what happened and he said that I tend to jerk when I first fall asleep sometimes. I just thought it was weird because that has never happened to me. I have never jerked myself awake like that. It felt like someone was shoving me from behind."
"The Happenings On 28th St","North Dakota","Haunted Places","As you may or may not know I have a few other stories I have shared with this site and also enjoy reading the many stories posted here as well. Throughout my life seems like since I was 12 and beginning puberty, spirits and the unexplainable have been the norm for me. I cannot seem to get away from some sort of activity taking place. This particular occurrence pales in comparison to my previous posts, but still worth a share I suppose.

 We were living on the west side of town a couple years ago in a subdivision. The area was nice, and the house we were living in was decent enough. However it was one of the few originals built in the area in the 1970's, so I'm sure it had its own little bit of history.

 We rented the place for a little over a year and had actually been offered to buy the home. We really did enjoy living there and were considering settling down there. But after the few episodes took place, we changed our minds.

 I recall the first incident being a voice, I was coming up from downstairs and I hear a Male voice right next to me say, "" hello "". I stop, caught off guard and respond hello back. There was no response. So I shrug my shoulders and go about my business. Some time went by before another occurrence took place. However my son whom lived in one of the downstairs bedrooms, often complained that he would hear walking on the floor above him whenever we were gone. Trying not to spook him, I would try to convince him that it was simply the house adjusting and such. He wasn't buying it.

 The second incident took place one night while my daughter and I were asleep in my room. Up until this night I would sleep with my bedroom window open, since it was located on the second floor of this two story house. She and I were facing said window and I had my arm around her, when I suddenly awoke and opened my eyes to what seemed like someone or something leaning over the edge of the roof looking in at us. When I fully realised what I was seeing I sort of jumped and the thing quickly leaned back onto the roof. Naturally I was startled by this and immediately shut the window and drew the blinds and from that night on I always kept the window shut & locked.

 I started telling my family of the occurrences and my husband being a skeptic made jokes on the matter. But still I began to feel as though something wanted our attention or wanted us to move. 

 The winters here get extremely cold and I'm a smoker, so I would go into the garage to have my smoke. The garage was actually a little creepy to be honest, it wasn't completely finished and showed the signs of the properties age. I didn't particularly like going in there, but I wasn't about to freeze either. I noticed that while I would sit in there an undeniable feeling of being watched engulfed me and I could hear what sounded like something walking on the roof above my head, sometimes I would even hear thumps and thuds. It was when my oldest son came to stay with us and he too would join me in the garage that I knew I wasn't imagining the noises. He would always say, 'hurry up I don't like being in here.'

 The 3rd occurrence happened around Christmas time, it was nothing major just some strange lights. I was walking into my bedroom, phone in hand getting ready to make a call, and was looking down at my phone walking into the room in the dark when I happened to notice a kind of patch of little green lights sort of hovering in front of a shelf on the other side of my room. My first thought was that somehow it was a reflection from a nearby christmas light, so I turned around to look behind me to see what was causing it, but there wasn't anything that could cause it and we didn't own any green lights. When I turned back to look at the weird floating lights, they were still there and moving to the right very slowly. When I realized it wasn't anything logical it made me jump and then it disappeared. I went running into the kitchen kind of spooked.

 Again I told my husband what had happened and once again he made a joke about it. But I know what I saw. I started feeling a bit uneasy by now and no longer felt at home in this house. 

 The final occurrence that took place and pushed me to vacate the premises was this. My husband works nights and so I sleep alone most nights, he gets home very early in the mornings but is typically quiet so as to not wake everyone up. But this particular morning he had come into our bedroom and was digging through the stuff laying on the top of my jewelry armoire. He had been moving the stuff long enough to wake me and I laid there aware that he was in fact making a bunch of noise, naturally I became a little agitated with this because he just wouldn't stop and it was very early. So without opening my eyes I say to him, what are you looking for. He doesn't say anything and stops digging through the stuff for a few moments and I wait for his response, still nothing and he begins shuffling the things again. At this point I become a bit angry wondering why he's acting like that, so I open my eyes and start to say ""did you hear me "" when I notice he had turned the bedroom light on. I was really upset and caught off guard by the whole thing and decided I was going to get up and confront him. The digging had stopped and so I laid there waiting for him to shut the light out as I assumed he had found whatever he was searching for. When the light remained on I became furious, I couldn't believe he would be so inconsiderate, it was so unlike him. 

 I sat up in bed and stared out into the hall way wondering what in the world he was doing. I even heard movement out in the kitchen, which really convinced me it was in fact my husband. I was livid and jumped out of bed to go and ask him what he was doing and why he would wake me up like that. Imagine my surprise when I made my way into the kitchen and living room area and the house was completely dark and my husband had not made it home yet. For the week to follow I slept with my bedroom door locked. Which didn't work out so well for me because I had to get up each morning to unlock the door for my husband to get into bed. 

 It wasn't too long after that we decided to move. The landlords seemed very confused about our sudden change of heart."
"Faceless Gray Creature","Maine","Non Human Entities","One night my family and I were eating dinner and my back was to the kitchen. It sounded like a cutting board fell out of the cabinet behind me, and I didn't think much of it. However my mom looked over and screamed, so I turned to look, and hunched on all fours between the island counter and the counter I saw a very thin gray creature. It looked as if it's tight ashen skin was covering the features of its face, including its large mouth. It looked like it had arms but was standing on all fours. All the skin on its body was tight and gray. When I think back to it I don't recall feeling senses of evil, I just feel curious. When I saw the creature I screamed and jumped over the table and got ready to throw my glass at it but when I looked back it was gone.

 When my mom asked why I jumped over the table I told her what I saw. She seemed a little concerned and she told me she screamed because she saw a mouse. Along with everyone else at the table. I don't know why I was the only one who saw what I saw and I don't know why it didn't stay. 

I haven't ever seen this again, but I have seen shadows and people in my house along with abnormal smells and footsteps. I have always felt watched in my house although it doesn't scare me it just feels like someone or something is watching from the corners of the ceiling. My mom and I both can sense things that my sisters can't, because of this my mom does smudged the house every few years. If anyone has any idea what this could have been please let me know. I would love to hear your ideas anything would help me to get some closer to my experience."
"Odd Gifts And Vanishing Items","Illinois","Haunted Places","Like many of you, I'm the victim of the ""ok where did it go?"" and ""Where did that come from?"" syndrom. This seems to be a favorite game of ghosties world wide. Of course sometimes you can find a mundane reason something has wandered off; forgetfulness, pets, another human agent, but now and then you just have to scratch your head and say, ""Huh..."" 

Mostly it's the 'gifts', for a lack of a better word, that make me frown with puzzlement. These did not happen all at once, but have taken place in this apartment over the years;

* thin lines of sand appearing on tables and other flat surfaces. No beach or sandboxes anywhere around.

* money just showing up out of no where, never a lot but just 'enough'.

* an old fashioned nail - the kind with flat sides, and a square head just appeared in the middle of my bedroom floor. It was rusted and bent.

Not like my bedroom is a main thoroughfare - so no idea how that got there.

* screws, staples, odd pieces of coloured glass just found scattered about different rooms at different times. 

These are some examples, but the weirdest by far happened very recently, back in March. I had been doing hand wash in the bathtub, because I have a cat I always shake out the items before adding them to the soap water - wet pet hair is almost impossible to remove. Into the water they go, let them soak a bit, then scrub them one at a time. Drain the water, moving and pressing down on the items to get as much of the soap water out as possible, then refill to rinse. These happened to be white items, and after draining the rinse water, I decided they weren't very white, so I'd bleach them. Another refill with bleach and more soap, and a nice long soak. By now, that tub has been filled then drained 5 times, and is filled with very hot water. I'm draining out the bleach water, and in the bottom of the tub sits of all things a carrot coin! Crisp and very fresh looking. But... We haven't had carrots fresh, canned, or frozen in months. 

 In the same time frame as finding the carrot coin, other things of a non-paranormal nature took place. It had been discovered by the people in the downstairs apartment, that a homeless 'friend' of my roommate's was staying in the basement, which is completely illegal. Long story short, things got a bit heated, when I told this guy he had to go the first time. The second time, I said police would be called if he was even seen anywhere on the property. Think Charles Manson - that is the type of red flags my brain was urgently waving when I handed him his back pack and said he could not stay. Every fiber of my being screamed this was NOT a nice guy, down on his luck. Definitely not someone I wanted in my home or anywhere near me. Later, I would find out, that though not exactly Manson caliber this really was not a nice guy, he had prison time for violence and drugs, both taking and dealing, as well as assorted other crimes.

Late April I discovered my small silver jewel box was missing. I thought I half remembered moving it, but for the life of me could not find it anywhere. I looked high and low multiple times. In things, under, and behind. I even evoked the powers of OCD cleaning. That wee box was nowhere to be seen, and I was heart broken. Not only because it had sentimental value for me, but so did it's contents, the main 2 being my mom's twin ruby ring from the 40s, and a small cameo pendant that is around 90 years old. You just can't replace those sort of things.

I grilled my roomate on if his 'friend' or anyone else had been in our apartment, to which he said no. 

June came, and I had started to think, maybe the flatmate wasn't being totally honest, as this little escaped of his 'friend' crashing in the basement had caused some friction. But, I still kept looking, even in the most illogical places for it to be (under the sink, the freezer, and even down in the basement.) 

One night I was talking with a friend, and she asked about the box. I sighed and said, ""Guess my last hope is with the ghosties - maybe they could find it."" And that's when things got Weird, with a capitol W. 

The next day, I was overcome by the urge to look again in the foyer closet. I had cleaned this closet inside out - twice in my search. Up on the shelf (which is above my head) sits a cardboard 'catch all' box. I'd been though it a few times already, but what the heck. With difficulty I brought it down, and peering in, there sat an old, wooden cigar box, I had NEVER seen before. Flatmate claimed the same. Inside that box was not only my silver box (with all it's contents!) but things that had been missing for months or years! Gotta say, I was so excited I was practically doing the pee-pee dance. There were my best scissors (gone 2 months), a ring the roomie lost 6 years ago, assorted change, a couple of old receipts from like 2013 and 1997 for groceries, and a few odds and ends. My best guess, is who ever was listening, took compassion on me and brought back every thing they could, plus a bit. But, I do wonder, if somewhere someone is saying, ""Where did my cigar box go?"""
"Cross Necklace","Maryland","Haunted Items","I have this cross necklace that I wore since my high school days. I started wearing this necklace when something happened to me every night at exactly 3am where I will wake up for no particular reason at all and I get a kind of feeling of being watched. It happened for 3 consecutive days and on the third day I had a very bad dream. It was about Jesus Christ but his face changed into something sinister and scary. That got me scared so much I couldn't sleep well for days.

To tell you the truth, those experiences may or may not be related when my friends and I practiced witchcraft at a nearby sea shore. We have this public place with hotel and restaurant place that is near the sea and some parts of it are somewhat covered with tall grass and trees away from the main hotel itself. This is in the Philippines. 

Now ever since that time we played around about witchcraft, I had these feeling of overwhelming negative energy all the time around me. I am sensitive to energies especially emotions and just the feeling of it. So that's the reason I got this cross necklace which was blessed and given to me by a friend.

This cross necklace of mine is weird but it did help me feel secured and protected somehow. I have this mantra or I keep praying inside my mind that this cross necklace will stay with me to protect me from something bad always but if ever I am not worthy of it, like if I did something horrible I will lose this necklace.

I don't know if that mindset of mine made a difference but for the next few years I noticed that if I lose that necklace somewhere it will always come back to me. For example:

One time I was driving my mom off to her work to the hospital back in Maryland. I knew something was off because I immediately noticed I wasn't wearing my cross necklace. I really thought I misplaced it somewhere. So when I got back to the house I checked my room, my bed, everywhere, nothing. I went outside in our yard just in case maybe it fell on our front lawn but nothing. I gave up and went back to my room and I was shocked the cross necklace was there on top of my pillow, laying flat in the middle of it like it was neatly placed for it to be noticed. I didn't mind on how bizarre that is but I am happy I got my cross necklace back.

Another time I felt the cross necklace fell on our front lawn. It slid down on my chest into the grass, it did really happen so I bent down and looked for it. You would think that you will find it fast because you knew where it fell but nope, I searched and searched all over the lawn and even back track my steps just to make sure and I didn't find it. It was so weird and frustrating because I could've sworn it fell on the spot where I was standing on that lawn. I was disappointed to not find it but determined to look for it no matter what. It took me about 20-30 minutes searching all over the grass when I decided to back to the house and to my room to get away from the scorching heat of the sun when I saw my cross necklace placed on top of my pillow, exactly like the last time I found it when it got lost. That was weird but I was just happy I found it again.

Now this next thing that happened is the weirdest of all. This cross necklace I gave it to my boyfriend back then and now my husband back in 2013. I gave it to him because I knew that cross necklace was special and deep in my heart and mind it really is magical. I prayed to God that my boyfriend then will always be protected from harm as long as he has that cross necklace with him. I did made a vow that I will only give that necklace to someone special that I know I will spend my whole life with forever.

Not to make it cheesy and all so he has this necklace. I was in Maryland that time, I was either using skype or some app that I can talk to him that time. I told him that there is a typhoon coming that will hit our hometown (which means where he lives that time) in the Philippines. He said yes he knows about it and they are staying in and not evacuating as opposed to what the officials had urged the people on their place. My husband's house is situated near the sea. So in about an hour when the super typhoon struck our hometown I lost connection to him, I couldn't contact him, nothing at all. 24 hours passed I got very worried. I remember I was on the computer all the time monitoring the news about the typhoon and our place. There was this one news televised right after the typhoon aftermath and I distinctly remember it was already early morning around 5am on Maryland when the first news was able to air. I was shocked that the devastation was so severe they didn't anticipated the storm surge that washed away our hometown. Thousands died and the place where my husband lives was hit the hardest because he lives near the sea. 

I remembered I cried and I told my mom I'm going home to the Philippines. There were lots of bodies that are not recovered and although my chances are slim I prayed to God that he was ok and his family are ok. I remember we went to church first before my flight back to the Philippines and I prayed hard that everyone I knew and love is ok.

Now right about before my flight I received a sms message from one of my close friends in the Philippines that was somewhat connected to my husbands family. She said everyone was fine and alright. If only I can describe the feelings I had that time. I was shocked, happy, and grateful to God.

Apparently they did stay in their house but they were able to survive the 6-7 feet storm surge when they went to the roof. What was sad was the ones who went to the evacuation centers especially on the ground level died but my husband's family survived by staying on their house. If they went to the evacuation center, something different might have happened.

The cross necklace was with my husband but he said it fell into the waters. I was just glad he was ok. Fast forward to a month when I was in the Philippines with my husband's family in the Northern part. We were swimming on the swimming pool and guess what, we found the necklace on the bottom of the swimming pool. The brother of my husband said he saw it and looked familiar as it was what my husband's necklace during the typhoon. How weird that we found the same cross necklace a thousand miles from where it got lost on the waters and debris during the typhoon and now in the swimming pool.

My husband returned back the necklace to me when we got married 2014 in Baltimore. We moved to Texas 5 years ago and when I was stepping out from my work, I felt it fall down my chest and on the parking lot. I searched and looked for it until I gave up. Until now that necklace is still missing and I haven't seen it ever again. Something I remembered though about my necklace is that I once said that if ever I did something bad I will lose that necklace. I don't know if I did something really horrible but I just feel and hope that maybe it will show up for me like last time.

Thank you for reading my long post but I just wanted to share something that is so special to me."
"The Lady At The Santa Barbara Mission","California","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I grew up in California, and as a young child I was told by my Grandmother I had the gift. I was not quite sure what she meant being about 7 years old at the time. Some background on my grandmother she was 50% Cherokee and into what we would call white magic. We might also say a medicine woman. She also seemed to be able to communicate with animals even wild ones. Growing up I remember she had a pet Blue Jay and a pet crow with one leg named Hoppy. 

 My father would often comment that I had such an imagination when I would mention things that I saw or smelled. She could see that this made me feel bad so one day she sat me down, and she told me that when you smell scents no one else smells and see things no one else sees its not your imagination. This made me feel better, she also said to ignore my father's negative comments because he cannot see.

 At the age of 10 my father took the family to Santa Barbara Mission for a picnic and exploring. After lunch my parents wanted to go look at the flower garden but my brother and I had no interest in this so we went into the church area. We liked all the statues and old paintings, but the place was a little spooky. Next we went out the side door into a back area of the church which is also another beautiful garden but also had many graves. My brother and I were wandering around and I heard a voice from behind me say ""I know you."" I turned around and saw a Hispanic or native American looking woman. I noticed she had the strong smell of freshly cut roses. Again I heard ""I know you"", the funny thing was her mouth did not move. Next she pointed to an area with a short brick wall, next to the back wall of the church building. I turned and asked what she was pointing at but she was gone.

 I went to look in this area behind the short brick wall. I found a grave with the name Tomasa Burton. You wouldn't notice it unless you had been told where to look, it is almost hidden. I thought to myself ""that is strange she has the same last name as me"". It was then my brother said,""who were you talking to?""

 I said ""the lady"", and he asked ""what lady? I have been here the whole time and didn't see anyone.""

 I could still smell the strong aroma of roses."
"My Parent's House","South Carolina","Haunted Places","The house my parents and I currently live in was the house I grew up in. We moved there when I was 5. I moved out in my early 20s, but moved back a couple of years ago in a mutual agreement in which they get rent and highspeed internet and I get a place to sleep that didn't have a hole in the roof or outlets that threatened to burn the place down if I tried to charge more than one item at a time.

First a discription of the layout: the house is a single story three bedroom with a decent sized living room, one and a half bathrooms and a kitchen/dining room. We have a front door that faces the road, but we hardly use it. Instead we use the side door that enters into the dining room. When you come in the side door the small kitchen is on the right and the dining room table directly in front. Straight past the table is the hall leading to the living room, bathroom and bedrooms. The first doorway on the right of the hall is a short hall to the front door and living room. On the left is the main bathroom. The second door on the right is my brother's old room, currently my dad's music room. At the end of the hall is my parents room/half bath and off to the right of their doorway is a small offshoot to my room. We have an attic, but it's little more than a crawl space and half of it is inaccessible, the other half is used for storing Christmas decorations.

Now for the weirdness:

When we first moved in almost every night I would hear what sounded like a group of people walking around on the roof, complete with heavy footsteps and the wood creaking with every step. It sounded like one or more people were slowly pacing back and forth. It was always directly over my room. My parents didn't believe me when I told them, saying it was squirrels or the wind, but I knew what I heard.

We would go out for a family night every so often, usually out to eat and then to somewhere like Walmart, which for me and my brother at that time was a big treat. Every time we went out we would turn out all the lights in the house because my parents didn't want to waste electricity on an empty house, but whenever we got home there was always one light on, either in the kitchen or the living room. Even then I was a bit skeptical and blamed my parents for leaving the lights on to try and scare us because they were the ones who would always mention ghosts every time it happened, but they swore it wasn't them.

My room seems to be especially active. Even today I feel like someone is looking over my shoulder or is standing directly behind me when I'm on my computer. I would constantly have vivid, recurring dreams about waking up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom. It would be pitch black and really quiet, which isn't unusual for our neighborhood, but I would get out of bed and go down the hall to the bathroom. Nothing would seem out of the ordinary, until I tried to turn on the bathroom light. Either the light would come on really dim or not at all. At first this would start making me nervous as the darkness would start feeling heavy and oppressive, but before anything could happen I would wake up. Other times I would just get frustrated at the lack of light and even tried to change the bulbs a few times before waking up. After a while it got to the point where, once I realized the light wasn't coming on I knew I was dreaming and woke myself up. I've only had one really terrifying vivid dream when I was around 9. I remember the dream, but not the events after. In the dream I was on my bed, but it was floating on a sea of arms that were reaching up trying to grab me. They were all around my bed. My parents claim that they had to come in there because I was screaming and hitting the edge of my bed with a baseball bat, but I don't remember that part. 

I also used to love rearranging my furniture every so often when I was a kid. One night, after a rearranging, I was laying on my bed, which I had moved to where I could sort of see out into the hall, I saw the shadow of a young boy move down the hall from my brother's room. Thinking it was him I waited a few seconds and got up to check and possibly scare him, but when I got halfway down the hall I realized nobody was there. There are some times, even to this day, that I don't like going down the hall late at night.

As I got older and after my brother moved out the events seemed to just stop. Either that or I just wasn't paying much attention due to the usual young adult drama. After moving back in there have been a few incidents.

One night in particular was pretty bad. Not long after I moved back in I bought an old, large metal desk for a computer desk. A couple nights after I was trying to sleep and something just felt off. I kept hearing the metal of the desk ping and pop like it was flexing, only to immediately have my dresser creak like the wood was settling, which it's never done before. This continued back and forth all night, from my desk to the dresser and back and I didn't get to sleep until around 4 am.

 There were two other incidences that really made me pause for a good while and think about them: The first happened in January two years ago. My parents went up to Ohio for two weeks to see my mom's family, but I couldn't go because they sprung it on me last minute and I couldn't get time off work. My mom asked me if I would put the Christmas decorations back in the attic while they were gone. Two days after they left I decided to get it over with and pulled down the attic door and folded down the steps. After getting the first few boxes ready to go up, I turned to the steps and right as I put my hand on the steps to start to climb up an image flashed through my mind. If you've ever seen the American version of the movie ""The Grudge"" there's a scene where a girl peeks into the attic only to be grabbed by the spirit and killed. That entire scene went through my head instantly and in full detail. I hadn't seen or even thought about that movie for years at that time so having that thought, that clear, bothered me. It was enough to make me sit down in the living room for about 30 minutes because my follow up thought immediately after that scene was ""this is how I die"". Fortunately the perks of being 6' is that afterwards I just stood on the bottom step and pushed the boxes up through the opening without ever having to stick my head up there.

The other event happened a couple months after. Even though I work night shift I would typically stay up during the day and sleep at night on my days off. I woke up really early one morning around 6:30-7 and saw what looked like someone with a pale white face, wearing all black sitting in my computer chair beside my bed watching me. I jumped awake only to find a pile of laundry in the chair, my black jacket hanging on the back and my black hoodie with a round, white logo hanging on the closet door behind that. I will admit that it was still fairly dark and I was half asleep at that time, but every time I run the layout through my head, none of it adds up. The hoodie with the white logo, which could have been the face, was partially blocked from my view by my computer tower at the angle I was laying. That and the fact that it was hanging too high for the logo to be where the 'person's' head was. The back of the chair with the jacket on it was also too narrow and low down to be where the shoulders were. I've accepted my explanation as-is, because it freaks me out too much to think of someone sitting in my computer chair while I'm asleep since it's less than a foot away from the edge of my bed at all times.

Those are all my experiences so far that I can remember. I asked my mom not too long ago if she had any experiences. She didn't tell me about any of her's, but she did say that my dad has seen figures go up and down the hall late at night when he's sitting in the living room alone. I'm not very close to my brother and I wish I could ask him if he ever had anything happen."
"Phantom Bat","New York","Pets / Animals","This event happened in one of my childhood homes in the town of Newburgh, NY. I was about 10-12 years old so it was the early 2000's. 

One night I was having trouble sleeping, as I often did. My twin sized bed was up against the wall and I had a wooden dresser next to the bed, at the foot of it. I was trying hard to fall asleep, alternating between closing and opening my eyes. My eyes scanned the room and rested on a dark corner behind the dresser. As my vision adjusted and settled I noticed a black spot on the dresser. I was hoping it was just my vision playing tricks on me but after staring at it for a minute it seemed to move. My adrenaline started waking me up more as I observed it to be in the shape of a large moth. As I realized all of this, it flew at me! It looked like a bat. I don't recall it making any noise. No flapping of wings, it didn't scratch my dresser as it moved and made no noise as it soared towards me. 

I ran out of my bedroom and into the living room that was right next to it, closing the door behind me. I barely slept all night. I can't remember if I had woken my mom to search the room but nothing was found. The next day I slowly searched my room, hoping it was just a bird that mysteriously got in there. I didn't find any evidence that there was something in my room that night. The window wasn't open and there were no other ways to get in there other than the bedroom door connected to the living room. All week I was nervous about finding a dead bat somewhere in my room and luckily I never did. I hadn't had any experiences like that since."
"Walking In The Dark","Georgia","Misc","This is my first post here but I've been a reader here for many years.

It's 3:30 in the morning. About an hour ago I woke up from a dream. My Grandfather was in it. I walked into a church and I saw him talking with a group of people near the altar so I approached him and he was happy to see me. After he hugged me he suddenly got tired and older looking and even liver spots started showing up and his skin turned gray. I helped him to sit down. Then I woke up.

It bothered me and I couldn't sleep so I went outside to look at the stars. Lately you've been able to see Jupiter and Saturn but by this hour they were already gone. While I was looking up I heard clear footsteps walking a circle around me in the grass. Then they stepped onto the pavement and I saw a shape of a person out of the corner of my eye. I turned and nothing was there to be seen but they were still walking a circle that seemed to be five feet away from me. When the steps came down on the pavement they made a clicking noise in the way that dress shoes or steel toed boots do.

I heard the train in the distance and then I quickly walked back inside and locked the door.

My maternal grandfather has been dead for seven years and we were never close. He and my Grandmother were divorced in the late 1960's and I was much closer to her second husband who I considered to be my ""Grandpa"".

I can't imagine that he would be whatever is behind the footsteps.

We didn't even know each other.

Besides, I had the feeling that it was something else.

I had been awake for over an hour before I decided to go outside so I am reasonably certain that it wasn't imaginary. I live in the country in South Georgia, near Valdosta. There was enough light from the porch so I know it wasn't a deer. 

It may not be interesting and there isn't much on the supernatural side of it but I think I'm done looking at the stars for the time being."
"Soldier Ghost","Maryland","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","This happened around 2009 when my family moved in to this old house that was built in the 60s. It was a two storey house with 4 bedrooms, 2 on the 2nd floor where my room is and my little brother has also. The Master's bedroom is on the first floor and another room for my older brother. It has a basement as well which we rarely go to unless necessary. 

It is always cold down in the basement even in summer and I always felt like there is someone downstairs with us that we don't see. I've always been sensitive to the energies around me. I don't know how to describe it but it's like tingling sensations you experience at the back of your head or sometimes on my arms depending on where that energy is concentrated from. With that sensation I kind of feel some sort of weird emotions. That's why it's easy for me to tell if like I'm entering a house or place I get overwhelmed with strong emotions of sadness or hate I don't know it's just comes natural to me. 

Now whenever I go to this basement of ours I always feel like I get overwhelmed with sadness, like you want to cry but you couldn't. 

I shrugged it off as possibly my weird imagination or maybe I was just that sad that time even though I don't have a reason to be.

So a few nights living in that house something happened that kind of freaked me out. My room was on the 2nd floor and I remember that night I was sound asleep and then there was this overwhelming presence in my room that makes me think I wasn't alone. I woke up because I felt so uneasy like someone was trying to wake me up by just staring at me. I know it's weird but it's hard to explain. I just woke up because I felt I was being stared at with intense gaze, that's the best I could describe it.

My room was dark with slight dim light from my window coming from the street lights outside. When I was fully conscious I immediately looked at the middle of my bedroom and I saw this African American guy in a soldier's uniform. The uniform looks neat, there's no blood on it whatsoever. It's the same when you guys see on tvs when military guys go formal attire, it is like that. It was color green, neatly pressed with some medals or something on his chest I don't know. 

Now by that time I knew already that what I was seeing is not a live person because how the heck will a military person standing in front of me in the middle of my room where no one even broke in our house. 

He was just standing there looking at me. It was unnerving but he seems like he wasn't bad. He was just there, staring. 

So before I get even more scared, I offered a little prayer in my mind. I was like saying ""uhm can you go now? I'm kind of scared."" And I prayed the Lord's prayer. After a few moments of that, he just disappeared, vanished into thin air.

And that feeling I got, like the sadness and heavy emotions, it was also gone. 

After that night I never felt anything odd in that house anymore. We lived there for almost 6 years. 

By the way my older brother who was deaf mute told me in sign language that he always see a soldier coming out of a huge tree in our backyard. I don't know if that is the same person I saw but it shocked me because he described it as a soldier also. Weird I know."
"My Volleyball & The Closet","Indiana","Haunted Places","Background: I had never experienced anything paranormal, or even thought of the idea. I was a kid, and anything involving ghosts would keep me up at night. I never had paranormal experiences until a couple years after my grandmother passed away. I think she's connected to it somehow, but I know none of these experiences were her. 

 My first paranormal experience was when I was about eleven years old. My cousin and I were outside playing with my new volleyball on my trampoline. It was a sunny, cloudless day and we were just being kids. We hit the volleyball too high, and it flew up and over the net surrounding the trampoline. I was laying on my back, sideways, staring out the net at the falling volleyball. Instead of hitting the ground, the volleyball stopped moving at about the height we were sitting on the trampoline (about four feet above the ground). It was like someone had caught the volleyball, yet there was no one. For a split second I thought I saw a black figure standing in the yard holding the ball, but it may have been my eyes playing tricks on me because of the position I was laying in. Anyway, the volleyball threw itself back over the net and onto the trampoline, like someone had thrown it back to us. My cousin and I were so freaked out that neither of us would touch the volleyball. We left it there for the entire day. 

 My parents eventually made me bring the volleyball back inside. I didn't want to see it, so I hid it in my closet. Over the next year I would begin to think my closet was haunted because the door would open and close randomly. My friends and cousin refused to sleep at my house because they had stayed over previously and witnessed it open or close at night. At that point I was labeled the girl who lived in the haunted house."
"I Think I Have A Demonic Attachment","South Carolina","A Haunted Life","I think it all started when I was about 6 or 7 years old and it attached itself. Me and my friend were watching tv and I saw something white in my peripheral vision and when I looked, it was a small ""ghost"" boy. My friend saw it too and it ran into the other room. We looked everywhere but all the lights were off and everyone was asleep. So who or what did we see?

 We moved a couple years later and that's when everything got weird. At the beginning I started hearing footsteps. Then I started hearing things like voices. I heard a little girl laughing when I was home alone and ""she"" ran off with these HEAVY footsteps. Just know little girls do not weigh that much, that's how heavy it sounded and I heard this twice. I also get scratched all the time even today and hear loud bangs on the walls. Another thing is I was NEVER afraid of the dark. Someone exhaled in my ear twice and something pulled my covers. I yanked them back but something pulled back as well. But that's not the reason why I'm so terrified of the dark. 

 One night I was laying on my side and I had this intense feeling of being watched and when I turned my head a little I saw in my peripheral vision half of a body. It was so tall and dark.

 Yesterday, my brother and sister thought it would be cool to play around. We had the door open and my brother heard a growl. Then we heard it and it was very very deep. No animal or man sounds like that. I'm still seeing things and feeling bad energy all the time. I get very bad nightmares too of me being possessed or chased by demonic entities."
"He Wanted To See The New Little Darling","Pennsylvania","Family / Friends Visits","In January 2009 my dad was in a very minor car accident. He aspirated from the shock of a teenager hitting the car from behind. Then he passed out. It lead him to go into a coma. At first, he was in and out for a few days then eventually the coma set in and he didn't wake up. Despite there being no brain activity, the times I came into visit him, when he heard my voice, his eyes started to shed tears. I just felt he was trying to wake up to at least say goodbye but just couldn't. He died Mother's day of 2009. 

By no means did we have a perfect relationship. He worked a lot. He came home exhausted and irritated. He always said, I wish I could have seen my kids grow up instead of work so much. But, I knew he did love me. He called me, Little Darling.

It was sad when he died but I had a family of my own to take care of so I moved forward as best as I could.

My family was growing and I ended up having a baby girl exactly one year later to his death anniversary. It wasn't planned and especially not for that day... But I always thought it was a weird coincidence. Another, Little Darling. I felt he was smiling down on her when I realized the date.

I always felt bad he didn't get to see her but I still felt they had a connection due to the dates in some way. 

A few years later, the last baby of our family was born in 2014. Another girl. After the hubbub of delivery the Doctors left and my family and husband went home. It was a hectic day and I was glad to be alone in peace and quiet. Even the nurses were giving me a much needed break. I was happy to finally grab my last newborn babe and give her a snuggle. Just her and me. 

I looked up and there in front of me was the outline of my father in the reflection of a mirror on the other side of the room facing my hospital bed. He was standing in the mirror. It was his height. His build. His head slightly down. I could tell by the outline of his face he was smiling. I'd know my father anywhere. It was him. His features were all hazy and the interior of his body was hard to see but the external shape and outline of his body was there. I just knew he was there to see the last Little Darling. 

It lasted about 3 minutes then it faded away. The room seemed a little more somber after that. I said out loud, Goodbye Daddy. I didn't feel l would be seeing him again in this life. I gave my new Little Darling a kiss for him."
"Salem Black River Church","South Carolina","Haunted Places","My family first made landfall in North America in the 1730s. They soon settled in Sumter County, South Carolina and very quickly established themselves there. Ever since I was a little girl, I have devoured stories of ancestors' exploits and old stately family estates long lost to time.

 I believe that we walk between the siren songs of two influences in our lives - one from our soul that has seen many lives before and the other from our blood that speaks with the voices of our ancestors. I have always felt a very strong connection to that side of my family even though death and distance have kept me physically apart from practically all but my mother. Their pictures adorn my walls and the stories of their lives adorn my heart and imagination. In ""Coming to Say Goodbye,"" I wrote of a dream I had of a family plantation and the connection it made with me - well, there is one remaining vestige of that long lost manse, the family church. Today it stands as ""Salem Black River Church"" - an imposing neoclassical edifice constructed in 1846. If you are curious, here is a link to an excellent article giving you more details on the structure itself and some lovely pictures inside and out, though none truly capture the imposing impression the building gives to one standing in its shadow (https://www.scpictureproject.org/sumter-county/salem-black-river-church.html/comment-page-1/?unapproved=1281326&moderation-hash=76ff6e0ed9e2123fc5dd775e395b3cf0#comment-1281326).

I first visited with my husband in May of 2016. I was thirty years old and here was my first time finally setting foot on the earth where my family as I know it began. I asked him to wait in the car for ten minutes to give me a few moments alone to see the place for myself. As I exited the car, I can't really explain the feelings that swept over me but to say that they were not entirely my own. We had parked in the small circular drive just before the church and were the only ones there - likely the only people around for several miles. Slowly, I approached the massive white columns of the porch taking it all in as I went. The feeling of being so small but welcome and safe. I knew I didn't have long on my own, so I continued around back to the iron gates of the cemetery - within lay generation after generation of my family. The moment I stepped inside, it felt exactly as though I was walking into a room full of people who suddenly stop talking and look in your direction. For a moment, my vision blurred, then cleared but the feeling did not fade. So I started talking to them. I told them everything I could think of about my life and the people and things that matter to me. I could feel them listening. At last, I found the graves of my great great grandparents. Words left me and all I could do was lay hands on their stones and cry. Not exactly tears of sadness but more of homecoming or reunion. All too soon, my ten minutes were up (I couldn't ask him to sit about for too long) - he joined me in the cemetery and we poured out toasts to each of my ancestors. After exploring the site for as long as our schedule would allow, I finally and reluctantly went on my way. 

This past May (2019), I was able to make a second visit. It was a Sunday so I had hoped to catch a service as I would dearly love to get to know the congregation - likely I have relatives amongst them - but we were not so lucky. Still, it was wonderful to be back again - to feel so close to the spirits of my family. This time, however, when I approached the cemetery, I noticed to my dismay, a large padlocked chain binding the gates. I was crestfallen to have come all this way (it's a long drive from Virginia) only to be turned away. I couldn't bear the thought of leaving without visiting them. So, in a moment of desperation, I circled the old wrought iron fence knowing it was old and bound to have a chink somewhere. Sure enough, I found a place where a small depression in the ground had compromised its footing creating a gap just wide enough for me to squeeze through. Mind you, I DO NOT advocate trespassing in any situation - especially not on sacred ground - but this was an exception in my book and I certainly meant no disrespect. However, the moment I set foot inside the burial ground on the other side of that fence, I was beset by swarms of biting flies. Their numbers were staggering. I had been wearing a wide brimmed hat at the time and had to rip it off as they had gotten up under it and were biting my scalp through my hair. They were in my face, on my arms and legs - everywhere! And they were positively relentless. I was barely able to see to make my way to my great great grandparents stones, press my fingers to my lips to leave a kiss on their markers and a small stone before rushing back out the way I had come without stopping to pay any homage to any other of my relatives. The moment I was on the other side of the fence, the flies were gone. 

It seemed very clear that the swarms were protecting the cemetery though I couldn't fathom why they wished to protect against me. Nor could I understand why their protection was necessary now when it hadn't been before. On my return home, I did a little web searching hoping to find contact information as my husband and I hope to return in the fall to spend some time cleaning gravestones. In my search, I found an article that made my blood boil - it seems that in 2017, a pack of miscreants from the nearby base decided it would be a hoot and a holler to vandalize the church; spray painting satanic symbols all over its graceful white columns and kicking in the ancient doors. (Link to the story: http://www.newsandpress.net/salem-black-river-presbyterian-vandalism/ and with images https://tinyurl.com/y2kulxoo) Fortunately, they were caught and summarily charged. But, suddenly the means both mortal and otherwise to protect the vicinity made sense. 

I found blog entries asserting the site to be haunted by a 'belle' and a 'sad boy.' I certainly saw nothing of the sort on my visits. Though I do feel a certain sense of protectiveness about them - the idea of folks traipsing through there 'hunting' them is uncommonly dismaying to me - for, if they are there, they are my people - their sorrows are their own and not the stuff of spectacle. It has given me a different perspective on ghost hunting in general and, though I have yet to participate in one myself, I likely won't in future."
"Overwhelmed By Sadness","Massachusetts","Misc","This happened late Autumn in Massachusetts. We were living in an apartment building with about nine other families. One night we heard the sound of breaking glass and the smell of smoke. Our apartment was on fire. No one was hurt, but everyone lost all they owned. Later we found out it was arson. 

I went to stay with my Father's Aunt and my Brother and Sisters with our Grandmother. Two weeks later still getting past all that happened with the fire and all we lost. I was grateful that no one lost their lives but I began to feel sad and couldn't seem to get rid of the feeling. 

I wrote about it hoping it would help to get it off my mind, but it didn't help much. I still felt sad and was obsessing over why when the rest of my family had no such problem. I talked to my Mother about it. She understood and said I would get past the sad feeling sooner or later and not to worry.

I tried to heed her advice but weeks later it only seemed to get worse. I found myself in tears for no reason feeling so sad. That night I prayed to God to give me peace to take the feeling away.

That night I went to bed. Later that night I felt something odd and I woke up unsure of what happened. I looked across the room, over at the wall. Above the desk I saw two eyes. For some reason I was not afraid of them. Even though all I saw was the eyes I seem to know she was smiling at me.

I felt at peace and just laid back down and fell asleep instantly. The next day the sad feeling was gone but remembered the event with complete clarity."
"El Tovar Grand Canyon","Florida","Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels","On June 15, 2019 my family foolishly hiked the Grand Canyon in one day. We got to the top of the Grand Canyon at approximately 11:00 pm and we walked into the El Tovar Hotel where we were staying for the night. As soon as we entered through the front doors we walked into the lobby where no one was, not even at the front desk, which we thought was strange. Suddenly we heard a little girl say ""mommy, daddy"", and we looked up to the balcony on the second floor where we saw a young girl in a white nightgown run across.

 I thought it was odd that a little girl was up so late at night so I told my family to wait here while I went upstairs to check on the little girl. When I reached the second floor balcony I did not see the girl so I figured she went back to her room with her parents. I went back down the stairs and told my family I could not find the little girl. Since we were so exhausted from hiking 15 hours we just decided to go to our room and crash. 

While we were all sleeping my wife was awaken by a little girl's voice saying ""mommy, mommy"". She opened her eyes and mistakenly thought it was her daughter since the room was dark. She then proceeded to watch the little girl walk into the bathroom so she got up to follow her to see if she needed any help. When she got to the bathroom no one was there. My wife was confused of where our daughter went so she looked back at the beds and saw her daughter fast asleep. She got scared and jumped back into bed thinking maybe it was just a dream but as she was laying there she heard the little girl's voice again saying ""daddy, daddy"". She stayed up for a little trying to figure out who was speaking but after a while of silence she fell back to sleep.

 The next morning at breakfast we spoke to a staff member about our experience and they said that this hotel is supposedly haunted."
"Jacey's Sight","Utah","Children Who See Spirits","I have been quiet lately as I have been engaged in some deep thoughts. I still come and read through stories. Think about my own stories, but it's been a while since I sat down to put my stories into words again. Today I felt ready to talk again about Jacey. (Again, not her real name.) When we moved from Louisiana to Utah (my husband was military at the time), Jacey had a couple more experiences before whatever she used to see faded. I would say her ability to ""see"" whatever is gone. It seemed to disappear right around second grade. There were a couple small things that I keep thinking about.

First, I would pick her up from school (when she was in first grade and I wasn't working at the time) and she would be frantic that we get home so she could use the bathroom. So we had a discussion about why are you not using the bathroom at school. Being a former teacher myself I knew that bathroom time was something I always gave students. I questioned her on it. She told me that there was a problem with getting to the bathroom. There were people in the hallway. I said there are always people in the hallway, walk around them. I knew where the bathrooms were in the school. She said the problem were the people. She said her friend Sophie (not her real name either) did not see the people. The people were in the hall and they always looked at her. She also told me she couldn't play in the field because they were sometimes in the field too, and they were the same people. She said they were women, and they wore long dresses and had hats on. It made me think of pioneers. I did eventually work at that school for seven years. I went and asked the secretary what was the land used for before it was our school. I found out it used to be farm land. Even more interesting the school wasn't supposed to be built where it was. It was actually intended to be built across the road, and a block down closer to the city building. No one knew why it ended up where it did. I would like to say I didn't have any experiences there but I kind of did. When my grandma passed, I started seeing a dark shadow that I hadn't seen before sometimes move across my room when I was alone. I didn't feel anything coming from it, and I referred to it as grandma because she had been a teacher. She was so proud of me becoming a teacher. So sometimes I talked to it. I would say, ""Grandma I hope you can give me some strength today because it's going to be a hard day..."" I would tell her why it was going to be a hard day. Changing schools, I occasionally saw the shadow in my new room but only when I said a prayer and had included something for grandma.

Back to Jacey - second, we were driving by a cemetery, and this happened more than one time. Jacey from the back of the car says, ""mom why are all those people standing there?"" We were at a stop light at the time and I said, ""People where?"" She says, ""there"" and points to the cemetery. I figured there was a grave side service or people visiting, but saw no one. I told her, ""baby, I don't see anyone but that's a cemetery where people are buried when they die."" She then said, ""Why are they standing by the rocks?"" I don't remember replying to her, but I still saw no one. That wasn't the first time she asked me about people by the rocks when driving by a cemetery. Once she said, ""Most of the people are by that one rock over there."" I never saw anything.

Jacey is older and doesn't seem to see anything anymore. Maybe that's best. I might have one more story about her but have to look through my past stories to see if I have told it before. I do have others as I never did write about my experiences in my Louisiana house."
"I Think My Grandfather's Mad At Me","Washington","Haunted Places","I'm not the type of person to ask for advice online, but at this point, I don't know where else to turn. I've been experiencing some pretty terrible things lately, and a friend recommended me this site, saying that the people were very helpful when he told of his own haunting. So I guess you can call this a cry for help.

I'm fourteen years old, and me and my family have lived in one home all my life. I've never experienced anything I believed was supernatural until three weeks ago, and I never imagined that if I DID have such an experience, it would be in the supposed safety of my own home. I live with my mother and father, and my grandfather as well- until recently.

My grandfather passed away one week before these encounters began (aka four weeks ago.) He went peacefully in his sleep, according to my mother, and he has since been cremated. I took it pretty hard, because my grandfather and I had always been quite close. He was the classic cool grandparent, occasionally undermining my parents' better judgement and always being there to turn to for advice. 

The idea that he passed peacefully brought me some comfort, but it was short lived when my relatives- aunts, uncles, cousins and whatnot- began to take his things over the course of the next week. He hadn't left us with a will, so I suppose my family decided that they'd just each take an item or two. I, however, got my grandfather's prized possession- a music box. I have no idea what the song it plays is called, and neither do my parents. I don't think my grandpa knew either, but then again, I never asked him.

The song was definitely peaceful. I enjoyed listening to the calm melody it played. Unfortunately, by the end of the week, things got... Strange, to say the least.

I began to notice that my room seemed to rearrange during the night. Nothing major, just that sometimes when I woke up, there were books or papers on the floor that I knew weren't there previously. I didn't think much of it, figuring it was probably just my mind playing tricks, and looking back, I envy my old mindset.

By the next week, I was noticing that cupboards, doors and whatnot would violently open and close (I'm the only one home during the day.) I can't even tell you how many times I thought the house was being robbed that week. It didn't happen every now and again, either- it happened constantly. And the scariest part was that the door that opened and closed the most was the door to my grandfather's old room.

It makes me sick to think about even now, but something clicked when I picked up on that detail- was my grandfather the cause of all this unusual activity? My grandfather had never been the type of person to behave this way. He closed doors gently, he never made a mess of anything, and he was in fact very quiet and polite. That's what baffled me. If this was a spirit, it sure wasn't acting like my grandfather. It seemed like too big of a coincidence, but also one that made little sense.

But the worst part is, I'm fairly sure my grandfather is actually unhappy with me in particular. My parents never seem to hear or see any of the things that occur, and my room seems to be paranormal activity central- at least at night. Day by day, the events grew more and more violent. My room was destroyed practically every time I woke up this past week. I figured that maybe my grandfather wanted his music box back. I tried putting it back in his old room, and I got on my hands and knees, begging him to stop, but it was no use. I've been feeling sharp pains in my sides whenever I'm in one spot for too long- sleep is no exception. I've been noticing bruises and scratches all over my body, and it's frightening.

Ever since I put that music box back in his room, I can hear it every now and then, but the music seems a lot less soothing now.

I've tried staying awake all night so I wouldn't have to wake up to a bedroom that looks like a tornado hit it (oddly enough, my room didn't seem to get turned upside down unless I was asleep), but sleep really does catch up to you after a few hours. My sleep schedule is ruined. I have to spend two hours every single morning repairing my bedroom. I've gone to my grandfather's room and pleaded, but things only get worse and worse every day.

I don't know what my options are. I don't know how I feel about banishing my grandfather's spirit from the house, assuming it's him in the first place. I don't know how I'd even go about banishing a spirit anyways. I can't tell my parents, they'd think I'm losing my mind- or they'd get pissed at me, and tell me I should be ashamed of myself for making up such lies about my grandfather. I don't think they believe in ghosts regardless.

This is sort of a last resort. Any advice helps. I don't know where else to turn at this point. Only one of my friends even believes me, and he couldn't provide me with any real help or advice (though he did link me to this website, so I guess I have him to thank for that.) 

I can't keep dealing with this. I never feel alone anymore, and I don't mean that in a good way. My grandfather would never put me through something like this, and I'm just... Confused."
"My Bathroom Is Haunted","Texas","Haunted Places","My parents house was made by my uncle and his assistant thirty years ago, they had a construction company. The land the house sits on had piles of trash that they had to get rid of and old barracks that they had to demolish to build on the site. I believe the barracks are the source of the hauntings that go on in the house. These are a few stories that involve one of the bathrooms, the one I came out of in the story about my mom's doppelganger. These are not long stories so I'm clumping them all together into this one page.

The oldest story I can remember was me sitting on the toilet one afternoon. I'm probably twelve here. My dad, mom, and sister were all in the kitchen so no one was close to the restroom. I'm sitting there and it was completely quiet. I farted and all of a sudden from the shower, five feet from the toilet, I hear a fart. This isn't an echo as an echo has never happened to me before and has never happened to me after this. The shower curtain was open as well so nobody was hiding in there. I believe it was a ghost being playful or making fun of my ""situation"".

This story is probably the most scariest to me. I believe I was thirteen and it was around nine at night. I went in to the bathroom and sat down on the toilet to do my business and everything was normal. I finished my stuff and when I tried to get up, a force prevented me from getting up. I was being held down and I could feel an invisible force putting pressure on my shoulders. I tried to get up with all my strength but couldn't even force myself up an inch. I just sat there for a minute not knowing what to do or what to think and then I tried to get up again, and it was just effortless to get up. I got out of the bathroom but for the rest of the night I could feel a tingly sensation on my shoulders. I should've checked my skin to see if I had any marks but it was too freaky.

This story takes place both inside and outside the bathroom. I'm about fourteen and this takes place early in the morning while getting ready for school so my dad was up too. There's a window in the bathroom and a large pecan tree twenty feet in view from the window. I had taken my clothes off and was getting ready to get in the shower. From outside the house I hear lots of whistling and rustling from inside the tree. My dad hears it and I hear him wake up my mom. They go outside and start praying to drive out whatever these things are. I take a super quick shower and put my clothes on to try to go see what it is but by that time it's gone. They say it was two big black owl looking things, like a lechuza, a half witch half owl creature from Hispanic culture. I'm thinking the whistling was to try to lure me out since I was the only one awake other than my dad and the closest one to a window that they could see from the tree.

I was probably around eighteen for this one and it was early in the morning when this happened. When I get in the shower and the curtain's closed, I usually just stick my hand in the shower and turn it on, I don't pull back the curtain. The shower curtain was closed so I did the same thing. I was going to get in the shower and pulled back the curtain to get in when a woman started screaming, like if I was a stranger that had broken into her house and interrupted her shower. It lasted just a few seconds but it was right in my face and it was super loud. I stood there in disbelief for a few seconds after but still proceeded to cautiously get in the shower. I took a super quick shower and got out as fast as I could.

This last story takes place when I'm older, and at night, when I was about twenty. I had set a towel on the towel rack just outside the shower. I was coming out of the shower and I grabbed the towel. As I had the towel on my head drying my hair, a little boy said hi to me. I pretended like I didn't hear anything but I quickly dried myself off, put my clothes on, and got out of the shower as fast as I could."
"Odd Energy","Massachusetts","Misc","So our story begins 7 months ago. 4 days before Super Bowl Sunday. My husband and I went to bed as we normally do. I had a very quick nightmare about a man in a dark doorway. I was walking towards the door and just as I was going to enter the room. This man yelled ""No, Stop!"" But it was too late. I had stepped into the room and as soon as I did, I felt this strong energy surge through me. I immediately woke up and still felt a strong energy all over my body for a few minutes or so. As I lay there, I calmly tried to fall back to sleep but I had this odd sensation that my blanket was moving. I did not see anything.

 The next morning my husband called and asked how I slept as he always does. I reluctantly told him about my dream and he said ""that is really weird because I could have sworn there was a cat walking on our bed last night"". I think I was silent for a few moments before I said ""oh my god! I felt it too!"". 

Over the last 7 months, this energy not only visits us every night as we sleep but has been tormenting us at work. We work in different cities and we both feel it with us. Sometimes it feels like a light electrical charge on different places on our bodies. Mostly our head or legs.

 I have felt what feels like something wrapping around my legs while sitting at my desk or driving. It has even came with us while on an airplane.

 We have had 2 different physic mediums try to get rid of this energy, each one 2 times with no luck. We had a Shaman try to help as well as an energy reiki expert. Again, no help. I went to my church for help and had a priest bless my house 5 different times with no luck.

 We are feeling hopeless as this energy does not present like anything we have ever seen on tv or read about. We have seen 2 orbs and heard a male and female voice on a recording.

 We have honestly tried EVERYTHING! Sage, holy water, being nice, getting angry and demanding it to leave. I have lived in my home for 19 years without any paranormal activities, then Bam, just like that... It won't leave! We no longer sleep in our room because the energy is stronger in there. This is crazy... Right. My daughter just came home from college and she too is being tormented and came to sleep with us. She said she felt a strong electrical energy all over her legs and felt as if something was tugging at her blankets and she was falling into her bed. This is something we have felt many many times. Some nights are worse than others but it never fails to torment us each and every night and let us know its there every day. We cannot see the blankets moving while we are feeling this energy hovering over our legs. Sometimes it feels as if someone has taken a feather down the side of my face, then arm and again and again.

 I am sitting in the recliner typing this and at this very moment I can feel this energy surrounding me and feels like a cat kneading on my lap, but I cannot see anything. It can be terrifying at times. If anyone has any ideas on what this is or how to get rid of this energy, please help!"
"Grocery Store Ghost?","Georgia","Haunted Places","I'm a regular suburban mom who makes 3-4 trips to the grocery store each week... Usually the same store, and I've been shopping there for over 20 years since it was built. Starting about two years ago, I've had 5-6 experiences with items coming off the shelves near me. The first one I remember well because the store was very quiet that day and a bag of refrigerated bagels about 8 feet in front of me dove off to the floor. It did not just fall down off the shelf, but went out 2-4 feet beyond the refrigerator case onto the floor. It was immediately strange to me. I picked it up and probably mumbled something to myself like, ""Ok, weird."" 

I don't remember what the next couple items/dates were, but I do remember just afterwards once talking to a woman, an older stranger, about the phenom. I think she could see some expression on my face and asked if I was ok, and I told her that every now and then things just fly off shelves near me. She gave me some Bible verse that in her mind explained it perfectly well. She was quite nice and I remember coming home and looking up the verse and it was something... Pertinent (it's fuzzy in my mind though, which over the years I've found with things that seem supernatural...it's as if we are not SUPPOSED to be able to remember them with the clarity we normally have). I do believe God hooks me up with random people every so often for really good reasons, not to be sidetracked... 

The latest time something strange occurred was less than a year ago. I was almost finished shopping and was choosing my bread -- again, the store was quite empty -- when I felt something hit the back of my legs. Well, the bread shelves face the produce area in this store, and when I looked down, there were onions bouncing off the back of my legs, having rolled or flown at least 6-8 feet across the space (this is not a small market, but a spacious suburban one). I looked up to see a woman standing at least 28 feet away at the end of the aisle and she said, ""I saw that, I was looking right at it! Those onions just flew off and hit you!"" We were maybe two of three people in that entire area. I sort of laughed and said to the woman, ""Oh, it's the attack of the onions... But really, did you SEE them? Did they roll? That was weird, right?"" And she stood there sort of stunned, which caused me to laugh it off mostly. But inside I'm thinking, wow, this is starting to be a pattern.

I can think of a couple things of significance that could be related. First, we're in a very historic area with lots of Civil War battlefields and energy. In 1864, there were over 120, 000 Union troops mired in the mud in our specific area, with skirmishes everywhere, including right where our homes are today. Also, once on what would have been my late husband's birthday, I had spoken out loud to him in the car on my way to the store (having just remembered). By the time I walked into the store, I was thinking clearly about my shopping, not my deceased husband, but as I got my basket realized the song playing in the lobby/store was one that I always associated with him (the Janet Jackson song about an angel...don't even know the name, it's from the early 90s... And hardly EVER plays). And finally, this never happened to me before my mom died six years ago. I do have many dead people (I joke) but, my first husband, dad, mom, step dad, some funny aunts and grandparents... There's no telling with me, could be any of them! Have had many other experiences, but the grocery store venue seems so unlikely, just wondered what you all think? It's never malicious-feeling, more like trying to get my attention. Many thanks for your thoughts."
"Late Husband Communicating Through Old Vcr Tapes?","Georgia","Family / Friends Visits","Good evening. I've spent much of my afternoon reading this site with interest and could not resist writing to you all (on this dark and rainy post-holiday evening). I've spent years noting to myself dozens of incidents that seem paranormal, but have only recently been curious enough to look around on the internet, and your site seems really legit -- caring and intelligent. I'm an educated, grounded and stable individual, a Christian and former newspaper columnist, currently teaching and a mom of four great kids. I've lost many loved ones in my almost 60 years, but have always loved my life, felt quite strong and consider myself to be a happy warrior for my ""causes."" Guess what I'm trying to say is, I'm a busy, suburban mom, living near a large southern city but every now and then some compelling things happen and the mysteries of life compel me to seek out those who might know more than I do, on a topic I know little about (except for tv shows and a real appreciation for Dean Koontz novels). 

 A couple months ago I was finishing a basement cleanup that's dragged on for months. We live in a great suburban home, very bright and cheery, incuding the basement, which is more of a terrace level with windows everywhere and not creepy at all. I ran across a small box of VCR tapes that had not been transferred onto DVD and decided to take a look at them. As background, I'll share that my first husband, a Marine aviator, passed away 26 years ago after a lengthy and serious illness, leaving behind two daughters, ages 2 and 3, and me. Over the years, I feel like he's found small ways to let me know he's still with us... Some of them are really fun, but I'll stick with this one thing. So I'm in the basement about 3 in the afternoon. Middle schoolers (with my second husband) won't be home for a couple hours and I'm dying to see these videos from almost 30 years ago, one of which is titled, ""Best Tape for Dad."" I locate my 90s-era small tv with a built in VCR player and set it up on a chair. Sitting on the floor I put in the first tape and it's some great snow day footage of my daughters as toddlers with their Daddy, just charming (they're both grown and married career women now). I pull out my i-phone to take some snips to send to them at work (and to just have on my phone). I start noticing as I'm holding up my phone, taking video of the video, that in the phone camera there is a black line that pops up, not horizontal or vertical, but crossways like a slash through the screen. It's not on the TV or the video tape, just on my phone screen. I didn't think too much of it and kept taking videos of this tape in short segments. Then I started to notice that the black slash only happened at certain moments in the video. Mostly it popped when the camera panned to my late husband, but also during closeups of a precious little face or another tender moment. I notice the black slashes on my phone seem to be appearing at moments of significance, and sometimes more dark black than others a moment later. I know so little about the technology, but I wondered if a spirit was trying to watch with me, whether they could take energy from the pixels or something, which would make the black area. As I watch the tapes, I start talking out loud a little bit, something I've done before at certain moments, and the black lines seemed to almost happen more as I narrate the tape just a bit, sort of remembering. (i.e. ""Oh, here comes the snowball"" as in the video he throws one in my direction). 

 Next thing I know, my middle schoolers were home off the bus, and I was upstairs telling my 8th grade son, a really smart kid about electronics and other things, about this black slash going through my i-phone video. I joked that I thought it might be some ""ghost guy stuff"" which is what we call it (based on my recent interest in Ghost Adventures-type programs, for which I get teased relentlessly by all my kids). So my son was intrigued and wanted to see this black line, and I wanted to show it to him, maybe for validation... Or maybe hoping it would not be there when we went back down. So we did and I turned on the tape (sorry if this is getting boring) and there's the black slash on my i-phone again. How is it not on the tv or VCR tape? We discuss it, how it seems like there's a pattern to the line... Then as the tape is playing I suspect the line is actually popping up in response to my comments. I go way out on a limb and say, ""OK, can you do an SOS?"" (a military thing, haha) After which the black line flashes out _ _ _ __ __ __ _ _ _. (I might actually have that backwards). But we both were a bit amazed to say the least and reacted with big, ""OH WOWs."" The slash DID respond with an SOS! This is when you just blink and think, ""Holy cow, is this SOMEthing? Or am I wishing/imagining/pushing it?""

 Well, that's about it. I've not wanted to try it again since, something about not wanting to mess with things I don't understand. But has anyone ever heard about something like this? Also, when I viewed some of the video snips on my computer, which has a large screen, there were some places in the videos that I feel I could see... My late husband's likeness. And all I can say on that is, I think I've gotten pretty good at seeing ghosts in photos (stories for another day perhaps).

 Thank you for letting me share this. I know about EVPs, so it seems like if you can catch a ghost in a photo, positive imaging, then what I got was some kind of negative imaging... Or a portion of the picture was just not relayed... Maybe this is easily debunked? I'm wide open to all thoughts. I understand I can upload a photo at some point, which I'll do if possible."
"She Has My Face","Texas","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","When I was about 12 or 13 my mother had a cancer scare and had to look at the medical records from my birth. In the records it is shown that there was a still born baby, I was supposed to be a twin. The doctors never told my mother and she never saw it in any ultrasound, they told her what she felt was an extra placenta. Since before then my family has seen a girl with my face.

 When I was a child I slept in my parents bed until I was 6, the last year I slept in there, a girl more like a shadow, would stand at the end of my parents bed and stare at me for what felt like hours and then she would slowly walk into my parent's bathroom. I moved into my sister's room after a year of that and I haven't seen a spirit since then.

 My father has seen her in the bathtub in the master bathroom. He believed it was me and immediately left the bathroom only to see me in the kitchen, when he went back she was gone.

 My older brother that slept in the basement yelled at me for shaking him awake in the middle of the night for a month straight. I never did that. He said a girl that looked exactly like me, he thought it was me, shook him awake saying ""TJ wake up! Please wake up! TJ!"" He was angry of course and yelled at her ""get out of my room!"" He said ""I"" got sad and slowly walked up the stairs but he never heard the door open or close and when he looked no one was there. He started sleeping upstairs on the couch for a while.

 My older sister asked me why I went into her room in the middle of the night and kissed her forehead. I was sound asleep in my parent's room.

 My 4 year old niece insisted I went to a movie with our family and when I told her I was at the mall with my friends she casually said ""ohh so it was the fake Emmy?"" I was shocked I asked her ""who?"" she then explained calmly that ""there's a girl and she has your name and your face with long black hair (my hair is naturally black but I have it dyed dark brown) she was at my birthday party"" I asked her ""what was she doing there?"" She then explained further ""she was wearing a white dress and she knew Charlie's (my younger brother) name, she kept calling him 'Charlie! Charlie!' But he couldn't hear her."" I had no words, no one had ever told her the stories of a second me or that I was supposed to have a twin. She promised she wouldn't talk to her ""when she comes back"" because she knows that it's not the real me.

 My brother in law refuses to stay the night in my parents room because he saw her, wearing a white dress and a cross necklace, standing in my father's closet. I was out of town when this happened.

 Many in my family have the gift to see those on the other side, I am not one of them. What I fear is that one day I might come face to face with her, I am afraid she is not who we assume her to be. I don't know if she is my twin or what I fear most, something evil taking on the shape of the child my mother lost. My house was built in the 1970s no one has died here as far as I know, but things follow and feed off of members of my family and their energy. I once tried to figure out who or what she could be or what they want (there a many spirits in my house) my dad begged me not to, because when you seek something out you might actually find it. What could it be?"
"Glowing Blue Eyes","Texas","Pets / Animals","I experienced a lot of paranormal activities during my teenage years. This one in particular happened to me when my mother's friend was babysitting me. I stayed at their house in the country (Possibly Meridian, Texas if memory serves me right). It was a one story house out in the country, there was plenty of land and they had three sons and two daughters. So I had plenty of kids to play with. It was a three bedroom house so I had to sleep in the living room during the night. It was the first night I had something happen to me.

Their house had a very long and narrow hallway, to the north end off the the left there was the entrance to the kitchen. In the middle of the hallway to the right was a double door entrance to the living room which I was staying. And at the south side of the hallway it split of left and right. The left side lead to the boys room and the right to the bathroom.

I woke up in the middle of the night having to go to the restroom, and I walked out into the hall. As soon as turned my back to the kitchen, I felt the sinking feeling, I started panicking, it was a vibration went through my body, and my mind was screaming at me to turn around. I did and as soon as I did my body acted on it's own, I backed up and melted into the wall, my palms were on the wall and I was frozen solid, but my attention never broke from the kitchen entrance. My breath caught in my throat, and what turned the corner terrified me. 

It was a pair of blue glowing eyes, low to the ground and moving like an animal, or a dog, it felt like a dog. I stared at this entity coming toward me and I was frozen, I wanted to scream but nothing came. 

But the initial fear followed by a alarming sense of calm, I knew that it wasn't here for me, as I had these thoughts it passed right by me and turned left towards the boys room. After it turned the corner it was like I was released. I could move, and by this time I REALLY had to go, so I collected myself and just hoped that nothing would mess with me while I was going to the restroom. I don't even think I washed my hands. 

I've always wondered what this entity could have been, it was one of the more intense encounters I have had in my life."
"He Lost His Head","Missouri","Haunted Places","The year was 1999 and my ex husband and I were living in Missouri then. My boys were just babies then, 3 and 1. We had found a charming old farm house in the country and the rent was very affordable. It was a two bedroom home that was situated at the top of a hill and you had to drive up a long gravel drive way to get to it. On the property were several old farm buildings. One could tell that in it's day it was top of the line. I assumed by the metal awnings over the windows that it was a thriving farm in the 1940s or 50s. But we fell in love with it and settled right in. We didn't live there long, if I had to guess probably no more than 5-6 months.

 In the beginning nothing seemed out of place and we were quite happy there. Although at night I would go and sit in the screened in sun porch that overlooked the old buildings and always felt like I was being watched. You could always hear noises coming from the property at night, but that's to be expected. Needless to say I would make my smoking trips limited. We had moved in around May or June and Halloween was just around the corner.

 My ex husband and I were out in the yard with the kids and looking at the old original well that had been sealed shut and wondered why they quit using it. The owners had dug a new well and put a well house around it. I don't remember why we ended up standing in the well house, but there we were looking down into the well. I made a comment on how creepy it was and wondered how deep it went. As we're looking down into this black hole my ex husband says, ""wait a minute I think I see something."" With that he climbs in just a little and then after a few minutes, comes back out with something wooden. He hands it to me and I look it over. Because it was near Halloween I assumed that one of the previous occupants had made a halloween decoration. I decided it would be perfect out in the front yard and leaned it up against the fence. Not giving another thought. That is when it began.

 I had noticed our oldest boy, who was 3 at the time start to detach from his brother. I would find him in different parts of the house playing by himself and talking to someone. I kindof wondered why he had quit playing with his brother, but didn't think too much about it. This went on for a little over a week's time. 

One afternoon it was lunch time and I had called him into the kitchen to eat, he came in engaged in full conversation with no one. I asked him who he was talking to, now mind you he was 3 and his vocabulary was limited. He answers, my friend. I say oh that's nice buddy, is your friend nice and he replies with a nod. More curious I ask what does he look like, he then shrugs his shoulders and says he has no head. I will admit that I was caught off guard by this. Following this conversation I wouldn't allow him to play alone anymore and he had quit talking to this imaginary friend during the day and once again would play with his brother.

 It went on like that for the next 2 or 3 days and I thought that perhaps whatever was going on had passed, that is until I woke up in the middle of the night to him (the 3 year old) crying and shaking me. I assumed he had a bad dream and carried him back to bed. When I would put him back into his bed he would just sit up and tell me he didn't want me to leave. I would sing him some songs and reassure him that it was only a dream. He would eventually lay back down and go to sleep. This had become a nightly ritual for about a week.

During this week in the day I decided to play a game of hide and seek with my boys as we did all the time. I stood in the hallway and counted to ten. In this hallway there was an odd cupboard that was the length of the hallway but only about 3 feet in height. As I was counting to ten I hear this cupboards doors open and naturally I think that the boys had chosen to hide there. So after reaching 10 I call out ready or not here I come and start heading towards this cupboard, which I noticed one of the doors was cracked open. Completely convinced that my kids were hiding in there I tip toe to it and swing open the doors with a BOO. To my surprise, they were not there! I found it a bit odd, but that is all. When I found the boys they had been hiding in the back of the house in the laundry room.

 That night I awoke to my oldest boy screaming in his room. I rushed down the hall and into his room to find him sitting up in his bed shaking and crying, he seemed very upset. I asked him if he'd had a bad dream and he tells me no. I then ask him, why is he crying. He then points to a set of cupboards in his room. These cupboards went all the way up the wall but near the bottom there was one oddly sized cupboard, it was pretty small. Maybe big enough to fit a couple shoe boxes. The door was open and he was pointing at it. So I walk over and shut it. He still just sits there staring at it and crying. I ask him what's wrong with the cupboard, he tells me that's where his friend stays. I tell him that would be impossible since the cupboard was so small. He tells me his friend won't leave him alone. I ask him what does his friend want. What he said next sent chills down my spine. He tells me that his "" friend "" was searching for something. I ask him what his friend was searching for. He tells me, his head. This was pretty unsettling for me to think that my son was being troubled by such a thing at such a young age. I decided to become kindof aggressive with this friend and asked my son what his friends name was. He says George. So out loud in a very confrontational voice I say,'ok George I know you want to find your head but my son is only 3 and needs sleep, he cannot help you find it and you need to leave him alone or you will have to deal with me.' My son kindof laughed, I guess he thought it was funny watching his Mom yelling like that. I tucked him and told him that if George tried to bother him again to tell him to leave him alone. Which proved to be ineffective. 

The nights to follow I would wake up to my son screaming in his room, only this time when I would enter his room he had hid his under his bed. He would not open his eyes until I picked him up and turned on the light. He claimed that George would not let him sleep and was mad. In order for all of us to get some sleep, I decided that moving the boys into my room was best. That seemed to work for the rest of the time that we lived there.

 On one of the last days that we were there, we were out in the yard and the boys were playing as we had done so many times. I had forgotten about that wooden "" gravestone "" my ex husband had pulled out from the well previously, but here I was sitting on the porch and something urged me to really look at this piece of wood. I could see that there was writing on it that was faded and had noticed it when we found it, but I hadn't truly read the writing before just kind of glanced at it and put it in the yard for Halloween decor. Like I said I was just sitting there staring at it with the most overwhelming urge to go and read the writing, so that's what I did. As I began reading I felt my heart sink. The name carved into the wood was George, along with a last name and birth and death date. At the very bottom there was a passage that was mostly worn away making it impossible to read, however the last few words remained intact and it read;he cannot rest until he finds his head! I had my ex husband put that thing back where we found it.

 We packed up our things, loaded it into the trailer and left that place as quickly as possible. Eventually my oldest boy quit having night terrors and things returned to normal. I had hoped that if it was never brought up he would forget it seeing as he was only 3 when it happened, but years later when he was about 13 or so he brought it up and had some questions. I was stunned that he could remember that.

 About a year ago I wanted to see if anyone was living there so I looked it up on google earth and it is no longer there. I wonder if George ever found his head."
"The Night Gown","California","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I was 16 years old when this happened and living with my Aunt.

 I recall my first encounter with the little girl took place in broad daylight and while conversing with my Aunt. The two of us were standing there looking out the picture window, overlooking the vacant lot and immersed in conversation when I happened to notice a girl around the age of 10 or so just standing there at the edge of this lot staring at us. Normally I wouldn't have paid much attention to this, seeing as she lived in a pretty populated neighborhood; however this child was wearing a nightgown, it was mid afternoon and she was filthy (nightgown was tattered, hair was very matted and her face looked as though she hadn't bathed in some time). I quickly drew my Aunt's attention to this girl and asked her if she could also see her. My Aunt just stood there, mouth agape and stared at her. The only words to come out of her mouth were,""poor kid I wonder if she's lost, I don't recognize her from around here.""

 At that moment my Aunt headed towards the phone to call the police, hoping to help the child get back to her home. As my Aunt picked up the telephone, I watched this girl kind of give a smile and go running into the vacant lot and then vanish. I couldn't believe what I had just saw and stood there for a few moments searching for a sign of her. But she had unmistakably vanished. My Aunt hung up the phone and tried to act as though it never happened. When I questioned her on whether or not she had seen the girl vanish, she simply said... What girl.

 A few days later I was again in the area of the house looking out the same window thinking of the little girl when there she was. Except this time she was standing in the lot just on the other side of the fence, just smiling at me. Her smile made me feel uneasy and after her and I stood there staring at each other for what seemed like an eternity, I decided I would go outside and confront her. 

I made my way to the road and entered the lot, as I approached the child she gave a little giggle and once again took off running. I watched her dart off through the lot and then vanish at a group of bushes. I was determined to get to the bottom of this and so I walked over to these bushes, believing I would find her hiding amongst them. Instead there was nothing, no sign of the girl; however in the middle of this group of bushes was a small clearing and something urged me or rather drove me to pick up a stick and dig at this said clearing. So with stick in hand I began digging away at the soil and after quite a while the stick got stuck into something and I then pulled at whatever it was. When I pulled the object out from the ground, I noticed it was a piece of fabric. It suddenly dawned on me that this scrap of material looked identical to the little girls nightgown. Chills filled my body and I immediately dropped the stick and fabric and went running back into the house.

 I knew that she (the little girl) had been trying to tell us something at this point and probably should have gone to the authorities and reported what I had found, but because of where I was in my life at the time I didn't know how to handle it and decided to let it go (bad decision). It was then that the little girl started tormenting me. My bedroom was adjacent to the area where I discovered a piece of her night gown, it was just on the other side of the fence. The next night I was sitting up late in my bedroom with only a candle for light, doing teenager things and listening to music when I heard giggling. So I turned down the music to get a better listen to the laughter. And I heard it, the same giggle she had let out on my second run in with her. It sounded as though she was right there in the room with me, so I got up and began to look around the room, until I fixed my eyes upon the bedroom window. There she was just staring in at me with that same unsettling grin and giggling away. She must have been floating or something because this bedroom window was a good distance from the ground and she was just a small child. We looked at one another for a short time and I decided that she was not going to get to me, so I pushed a big armoire in front of the window so as to block her from peeking in the window.

 I then proceeded to return back to what I had been doing before she had interrupted me. I sat back down on the floor, still with only the candle as my light and turned the volume to my tunes back up hoping to drown out her giggles. I assume this angered her as the giggles became louder and seemed to echo through the room and from every corner. I tried like hell to just ignore her but it seemed like the more I tried, the more she tried. It was when she began to scratch and tap at the window, that I had had enough and thought that if I went to bed and fell asleep she would give up. Eventually I did pass out with the orchestra of sounds to lull me to sleep. 

I awoke the next morning feeling like I had been through the wringer, especially on my abdominal area. I was and always have been a sound sleeper, so I can sleep through anything (not very safe, I know). When I lifted up my t-shirt I noticed a long and deep scratch, the size of a small fingernail. I knew right then I was in trouble and that she meant me harm. For the remainder of my stay at my Aunt's I began sleeping in the living room and didn't have any more occurrences. I ended up moving out abruptly and never looked back, but to this day I think of the little girl and wonder whether or not she was ever laid to rest."
"The Early American Room Spook","Pennsylvania","Haunted Places","When I was in college in the 1990s I was very interested in being a tour guide for the University of Pittsburgh's Cathedral of Learning. 

On some of the floors they have classrooms that are decorated in ethnic countries designs. These are called The Nationality Rooms. They are classrooms used by the school for classes but they are just a bit special in their decor. Examples: The German Room, The Hungarian Room, The English Room... Typically each room is sponsored by the country it represents by a special ethnic interest group. Items from the country are included in the design or decorations. 

I was given a packet of info, memorized the information and began as a member of, Quo Vadis, the tour guides for The Nationality Rooms. 

I had my favorite room. It was The Early American Room. I just thought it was super cool. It had a small secret door that went to a secret stairwell leading to a second floor only accessible by that door. Upstairs there was a bed, a cradle and a rocking chair. After seeing it, I just loved everything about it and always wanted to include this room in the tour. 

But, the director of our group always tried to downplay this room without much explanation. (She was a little spooked herself of the room it turned out.) If you Google information about this place, you can learn that she had a personal connection to the room as the items had been passed down in her family. I did not know that at the time. She believed the room was haunted. But, I knew nothing about this at the time.

Each Nationality Room had keys to each of the doors. But 9 times out of 10 the key I had to the Early American Room wouldn't open the door. Sometimes this was very embarrassing as I was in charge of large school groups waiting to go inside. I just thought it was me. Dumb me didn't know how to properly use the key. So, I would go and find the director and ask her to open it. Usually, it opened for her. 

Once another tour guide fellow mate got it opened for me and he said, ""Well you know this room is haunted"". I totally thought it was a joke and did not for one second think it true. 

On another occasion, I got the door opened with difficulty. A group of kids maybe around 9 or 10 years old were my charges that day. Only small groups of a few kids each could go up to the second floor at a time. The teachers stayed with the remaining kids. So I gathered my first group to go up. Usually, I go first and they follow but this time, they ran ahead up the secret staircase and got to the top. 

I heard a screaming coming from them. I ran up. The bed was disheveled as someone had just been sleeping there with an imprint in it as if it had been pushed in by the weight of a body. The rocking chair was rocking back and forth. The cradle was rocking also and the blankets inside were messed up. A few of the kids said they saw a woman in the room. An old, mean looking woman in old clothes. I immediately told them that was impossible and it was their imagination. I didn't see anyone. I thought, ehhh, kids imagine stuff. The bed, I explained, was not checked by the janitor the previous night and was *rumpelled by some other kids in a previous tour by another tour guide*. The cradle was rocking but I thought hmmmm ok. The chair I did think was weird that it was rocking but I said it was just from all the commotion of us coming up the stairs. The kids were scared and wanted out so I said, ok well let's go back downstairs. 

When the other kids heard it was scary up there no one else wanted to go up. The teachers also thought it was scary and said, Time to leave! I honestly did not believe it was haunted at all. Everything seemed explained. 

A few days later, I gave a night tour to a group of adults. In the main part of the room there are some display cases of artifacts. A watch I think, not sure what else. Well one lady asks me, "" Is this room haunted?"" I laugh it off and say of course not! But the lady just shakes her head and says ""Yes it is"". She said she could sense a spirit of an old woman and some others too. She calls my attention to the display case and I did have to agree with her that the items inside seemed to be giving off literally cold steam. Ice cold. I never experienced this in any of my other times there so I was very perplexed where the ice steam was coming from. At that moment, the lights started to flick on and off and everyone in the tour got creeped out. They all said, Let's get out of here. I did feel a little creeped out and was confused, but I wasn't sure what to think. 

Not long after, I was asked by the director to stop going into that room. It was closed for awhile.

Years later while randomly reading stuff, I came across articles that talked of the same experiences in that room. I did not know it was reportedly haunted for real. I didn't know I had textbook experiences that others had the same stuff happen to them.

The Nationality Rooms are still open for tours by appointments. But, I'm not sure which are available to see as they do routinely close rooms for repairs. The best time to go is around Christmas when they do costumed tours. 

Just thought I'd share another one of my tales. Hope you enjoyed."
"What Is Up With My New House?","Nebraska","Haunted Places","Let's get a few things out first off, I do not believe in ghosts exactly, although I do agree that the energy that leaves a person at death can't be destroyed and doesn't just disappear. I just don't know where it goes. I also would like to think myself as someone that does not get intimidated easily. I work at a maximum security prison, in the segregation unit and hold my own against unknown threats pretty well. That being said, I'm at a loss in my new home and I am willing to be open minded on how to peacefully exist here.

I moved into this gorgeous home that is recently partially renovated (I'm renting from a friend). By partially renovated I mean they put in new wiring and light fixtures. The hardwood floors, the cabinets in the kitchen, the wood molding even the interior doors are all original to the 115 year old house (and it is beyond beautiful).

The first night there was some odd creaking on the floors, but I blamed it on the foundation ""settling"" as it does need lifted still. After the 5th time a seemingly latching cabinet door in the kitchen swung open loud enough I heard it, I went to my sister's house and picked up my cat who wasn't moving in just yet originally. 

A few days passed with the occasional odd noise, and the occasional cabinet door opening when it usually stays latched but nothing major other than my cat acting agitated out of nowhere (most likely due to the move when the house isn't set up yet). A family member came to visit for a few days about a week after I moved in, and commented about a sliding door that was recently installed on the living room archway constantly being open even after she closed it. I told her it was probably my cat but she insisted he was with her at least one of the times. I blew her off as either the cat or the fan was blowing it open, easily explained. 

That night I was sitting on my couch watching TV with my cat on my lap sound asleep and purring. I suddenly heard heavy footsteps coming from the kitchen and walking towards the living room. I wear boots for work and it sounded like my boots do when I walk around, just really loud. I was trying to figure out why my guest was awake at 2am let alone wearing shoes as I called her name. The steps continued moving about the kitchen and I heard a snort from the bedroom. My guest was sound asleep in bed. Okay creepy, but maybe I'm imagining things or something. 

That day around noon I'm again watching TV my guest is on the couch with me and the cat is in the kitchen using the litter box when a painting I had hung up abruptly ""jumps"" off the wall and smashes. I decided it was a faulty nail and picked up the glass and set it aside to be reframed but my guest decided it was time to leave then. 2 days later I get home from work at 0230 and find every single door in the house wide open when I went through and latched all of them on my way out for work. I ignored it figuring the home owner came to do some work on the house (the next day he stated he had not been over since I moved in as he has been planting his fields) and closed all of the doors again. As I was trying to sleep I kept hearing the squeak of the doors opening and figured I needed to turn the fans down, but when I woke up they were all wide open and my TV was on which I definitely did not turn on and the remote is kept in a drawer.

Weird things like this have been going on almost daily since. Doors opening, cabinets opening, floors sounding like someone is walking on them, things falling off the walls, and strangely enough my Google home will suddenly start asking me to repeat my command when I hadn't said a word in minutes. 

Fed up, I finally looked to see if anyone ever died in this house but the records only go about 50 years back on location of death so there are 65 years unaccounted for.

I was staying happy with explaining it away until about 3 hours ago. I was asleep on my couch, my cat is asleep in his cat bed and my dogs are with my sister at her house. Suddenly my blanket gets ripped off of me and the door to my room (which is off the living room) slams shut hard (I would find out that it slammed shut hard enough it locked). 

While I was trying to figure out WTF happened and was reaching for my bedroom door to open it I hear the creepiest noise coming from my room. It sounded like a mix between an old gas stove roaring to life and a dogs growl. I froze and suddenly felt extremely cold, got goosebumps and kind of panicked for a moment. I got myself together and spent about 30 minutes trying to unlock my door. 

When I got the bedroom door open finally I found my closet door wide open and random items knocked over and my quilt on the floor. I was picking up the mess looking for a wild animal or something when I heard a creepy hiss that made me freeze up again. As soon as I could remember how to move I took my cat and locked the house and went for a late night fast food/comfort food run. I'm now home again refusing to be scared of my house but everything feels super uncomfortable and strange. It's almost like that feeling you get when there is free floating anxiety that you aren't addressing. 

Anyone got any take on what's going on here? This house was built in year 1804 and saw this town grow up around it. I love this house and plan on buying it once my lease ends, but I don't know how to handle this situation. I can't explain tonight away, and I'm at a loss."
"Mirror","Texas","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","My wife placed a large mirror in the corner of our room. It is on my side of the bed at night. Even though I don't look at it I know it reflects me the entire time during all phases of my sleep cycle etc. About a year ago I woke up at around 3AM and my left arm was stiff at a 45 degree position above my body. I attempted to move it and I could not. I was conscious so I thought to myself this must be sleep paralysis and I have just never experienced it, however after that occurred to me as if to refute that I was pulled abruptly and violently towards the mirror in the corner of the room and fell partially out of bed. It scared the shiat out of me.

Fast forward to two nights ago around 4 AM I woke up sexually aroused and looked at my partner. She was of course sound asleep. I thought to myself I must have been dreaming about something erotic,however, a felt a chill on my genitalia it was like really comforting but also the only way I could describe it as otherworldly. Like cold and electrostatic. We have an adjustable bed and it began to move as well just slightly up and down. I then felt a hand stroke my forehead as if to comfort me. Again an additional element to validate... Yes I am here... No this is not a dream... Only this time it was like...don't worry you will be ok I'm just saying hi.

It's not a single event but rather a combination of events over time that cause me to believe in the unseen, possibly a mixture of alternate realities from the paradox a mirror creates, or perhaps an untimely death on the ranch land long before it became a residential area. All I know is I think it's cool but I don't trust it and hope I don't experience these visitations in greater frequency."
"Baphomet Tattoo Gone Wrong/ Otherworldly Entities","Texas","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","About 2.5 years ago I got a tattoo of the baphomet on my arm. I'd always liked the symbolism and subscribed to the meaning of dualism and always took it as the most pure embodiment of the human condition.

A few months later I was diagnosed with kidney cancer and felt into a deep bout of alcoholism. Everything in my life crumbled around me for the most part. A few months after that I developed pretty awful sleep paralysis, very frequent. The more extreme visions were this terrible giant black cat that clawed my face (no real scratches) as well as ""awaking"" to 4 of 5 blacked hooded figures along my side of the bed, each about 4 feet tall. Somewhere around then I had a 3 day spell of horrible visions, images I've never seen in any book, but completely fleshed out gorey and demonic images. On the 3rd day I was harrassed, taunted, and terrified by these pure evil voices for close to 24 hours that no one but myself could hear. During this to I guess prove themselves they lifted my denim jacket straight up off my couch about 3 feet in the air. Just as if it was quickly tossed up and fell back down. I ended up being hospitalized because of my manic state for the torment and ""hallucinations"". Everything was quiet for a few months minus the obvious dread of something happening again.

Then it happened again, this time so very much more intense, this time the auditory terrorizing was coupled with horrific visions that stayed with me the entire time, multiple entities taunting me from within the rooms I was in and blocking exits. Obviously a lot more happened during these that would take ages to go through bit by bit. I ended up being hospitalized again because I completely lost it. I did not harm anyone and fortunately did not try to harm myself even though they told me it was the only way to make it stop.

It's about 6 months now of silence although I often feel weight upon my legs at night in bed. Some nights are harder than others because I feel that they can return at any time and I'm much more paranoid about bumps in the night. I'm not sure why I felt the need to share this now, I've never been able to discuss it with anyone because even I know how absolutely insane it sounds but for what it's worth, it happened. I know what I experienced was as real as looking at my hand in front of my face but sadly I'm forced to keep it inside.

"My Step-mom Says Goodbye","Ohio","Family / Friends Visits","It seems that most of my experiences throughout my life have been with family members and close friends. I honestly can't say why these are the only type of experiences I have. I wish I knew, honestly, because I am very open to the idea of spirits. But I shall get on with my story.

This happened about 22 years ago. My step-mom had been sick for a very long time. She had cancer that had metastasized. At one point we actually thought she was getting better, but she didn't.

My father called me one morning in December and told me I needed to get to the hospital as ""Mom"" wasn't doing well at all. I got there as quickly as I could. I asked her if she knew I was there and she squeezed my hand. After visiting for about 45 my minutes, my father wanted to go home and get cleaned up so I told him I'd drive him.

""Mom"" had told us before she got this bad that she didn't want Dad there at the hospital when she passed. (Now, mind you he'd been at the hospital every moment day and night for the past week since she'd gotten that bad.) I bent down to kiss Mom and whispered that I was taking Dad home for a bit. It didn't seem as though she'd heard me so I said it again and asked if she heard. She squeezed my hand. I kissed her cheek and told her I loved her and took Dad home.

At the house, Dad showered and I sat in the kitchen having a cup of coffee and looking out at the pasture lost in my own little world; when out of nowhere, I heard my own voice in my head say ""It's Ok ""Mom"" you can rest now. I love you"". 

Less than 30 seconds later, the pager the hospital had given to my father beeped. He freaked out. We finally found the pager he had set down and he called the number back. My step brother told him that she took her last breath a couple of minutes prior to the page.

I don't know if she said goodbye to any one else the same way she did me, but I think I was lucky. It was a real blessing and a memory I will cherish forever.

Thanks for reading."
"Butt Squeezing, Arm Squeezing And Hair Yanking","Arizona","Ghost Tours & Haunted Hotels","I went to Tombstone, Arizona about 2 weeks ago. It was my first paranormal trip ever. I went with my father and his girlfriend. Our main event was the birdcage experience. Our tour started at 6:15 pm, and I was nervous as all hell. My heart dropped repeatedly when inside. The stories were what made me scared the most. Anyways, after we began and the tour guide finished her first part of her story, we went to the main room - where all the artifacts are. While the tour guide was talking, mostly everyone besides my dad, his girlfriend and myself were all standing near her. And as scared as I was, I happened to be standing nowhere near my family. A few minutes passed and I was still standing by myself, I then felt my butt get squeezed aggressively - at first I tried debunking it as my phone moving in my pocket but it was too aggressive to be that. I freaked out and went by my dad. As we were walking downstairs to the poker room, I felt something grab my arm extremely aggressive, I again freaked out and stood by my dad.

 Finally, when the actual ghost 'hunt' began, I felt my hair being yanked a few times. I almost forgot one of the main things - as we were sitting in the circle, and before the tour guide turned off the lights, one of the electromagnetic devices went off, and as we saw that and asked the spirits, who it was; the lights flickered intensively. Those were pretty much the main things I saw/felt. I did hear a few things such as - a dog whimpering, or sniffling and aggressive tappings near the hearse which is said to be a spot where a little boy plays. I tried debunking it as paranoia since I was really nervous, but who really knows?"
"Old Home","New Jersey","Haunted Places","At the home I was born in, as a child we lived with my grandparents. When my parents were married, my grandparents gifted them the house for their wedding and moved out. My mother grew up in the house and said that all her life she had an eerie feeling in the house. I have no idea when the house was built or anything about the owners before my family. 

 When my mother was still engaged to my father, she opened their bedroom door one night to go to the bathroom, and standing in the hall in front of the door was an image of herself as a young girl. The image reacted to her being there, turned and disappeared down the hall. My mother said that she recognized the dress as one she had worn around that age.

 A few years later, my little brother is an infant. My mom and aunt were outside on the back deck, having a smoke and a drink together when my mom heard my brother crying from the baby monitor. She went to get up and my aunt told her that she would get him, she had to use the bathroom anyway. So she went inside and my mom listened, my brother went quiet and my aunt came back outside. She asked my mom if she had gone inside to take care of my brother anyway, to which she said she hadn't. My aunt told her that she had heard her walking down the hall mumbling about ""the godd**n baby is crying again"".

 And, finally, this one spans over the whole time that I lived in that house after my grandparents had moved out. My grandmother was a frequent visitor, but every time she would leave the house, every smoke alarm would go off at the same exact time precisely five minutes after she closed the door behind herself. We tried everything we could from disconnecting them to taking out the batteries, but it always happened."
"The ""boogieman""","Ohio","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","My name is Savannah. I have been dealing with many paranormal encounters at my workplace. I work at an Assisted Living Facility. I have been here for four years. I started back in high school, and am now almost 21.

 Our facility has 2 different units. The 1st unit, ""AL"", is in the front of the building, it consists of elderly who only need a small amount of assistance. The second is our, ""MC- Memory Care"", unit, consisting of our Alzheimer's and Dementia/ sundowners residents. I have experienced lots of unexplainable things in my four years of working here. I have worked all three shifts, those being day shift, evening shift, and night shift. Currently I have been doing strictly nights.

 Last night, the night of June 22nd 2019, I experienced something that had topped everything I have had to go through here paranormal wise. It all started with one of our residents in the MC unit seeing a man in her room. I will call this resident ""Pam"". (All names mentioned from here on out will be fake names due to HIPPA.) Pam was up all night long, saying that there was a man on her room. Due to her dementia, she often sees her late husband in her room and often talks of seeing people who aren't there. She also has brain cancer which contributes to this. So, knowing this information we normally would have assured her that no man was there and she would go back to sleep. 

After multiple occurrences of Pam waking up and talking about a man, her neighboring roomate, whom I shall call Brianna, was wide awake in her bed. She was talking. This was not normal for Brianna. During this time my coworker, Kate, was working MC. She was brand new, and this was her 1st night by herself. I,on the other hand, was working in the front of the building in AL. Kate went in the room to see what was going on with Brianna. Kate then came to me, telling me that Brianna was scared, also saying a man was in her room. Kate asked me if I could come help her because I normally work in the MC unit. She thought that if I came back there it would be easier to calm Brianna down. I agreed.

 When first walking into the room I could feel the energy was off. As I walked up to Brianna, I could tell that she was terrified. I sat down on the corner of her bed, and grabbed her hand. I said, ""Brianna, baby, what's wrong?"" She looked at me, with terror in her eyes and said, ""Boogieman"". I then felt my gut sink, and my skin crawl. I jumped up, and ran out of the room. Due to fear I had to try to gain my composure. I wasn't going to leave her in there with this so called, ""boogieman"". 

After calming myself, I went back into her room and turned on her light to see Brianna pointing at the corner of the room. She was silent. I sat beside her, and she rattled off more broken sentences about the man. I was able to calm her down enough to where I thought maybe she would be able to get so sleep but as I went to leave she yelled, ""please don't leave me"". I again sat with her as she sat up and was still pointing at the corner of the room. I was able to get her to lay down and attempted again to let her get some sleep. This time she shut her eyes. I wanted to check in on her often, because I didn't want to leave her alone and afraid. I checked every 15 minutes only to find her awake and pointing at the corner with tears in her eyes. It was 5am at this point, and this has been going on for almost two and a half hours. I decided that we should go ahead and get her up and dressed for the day, since she wasn't comfortable sleeping. 

At this point our nurse was passing morning meds on AL, so I went to the front to update her on what happened. She was in with a resident whom I will call Jessica. (Mind you, the AL unit is for residents who need little to no assistance. All of them are in their right minds.) 

So, our nurse was in Jessica's room, and Jessica was also terrified. As I walked in, Jessica was telling our nurse that a man was pounding on her door all night long. She said that he came into her room and was talking to her. Jessica said she couldn't make out most of what he was saying because she was so terrified. She pretended to be asleep hoping that the man would go away. While explaining to us what had happened she kept repeating how he was, in her exact words, ""panting"" at the door and banging on it constantly throughout the night and then finally came in not too long before the nurse came to give her her morning medication. She said he was standing at her bed looking at her, and said at one point the man had mentioned something about the pants she was wearing. She pretended to sleep until the nurse came.

 After talking with Jessica I pulled the nurse as side and updated her about the chaos in MC. The nurse informed me that while passing meds in MC, where Pam and Brianna are, she was in with Brianna's neighbor. A little information on Briannas neighbor, who I will call Lacey, Lacey is hard of hearing, and can not see very well. Her dementia is a special kind. She lives in her memories and will talk to herself. Normally when talking to herself she will be the one leading the conversation. Asking direct questions, and making direct statements. Okay, back to what the nurse was telling me. The nurse went into Lacey's room to give her morning medication to her. When she walked into her room, Lacey was looking at the corner of the room having a full conversation with something... Saying things like, ""Oh, that is funny!"" While laughing. This is unlike Lacey because like I mentioned earlier normally she will make statements and not get a response (because nobody is there to respond) but she never responds, if you can understand what I mean by that. It's complicated, but as caregivers we know our residents and this behavior wasn't like Lacey. The nurse was trying to get Lacey attention but she was focused on the corner. She then stepped into her view, telling Lacey it was time for her morning medication. Lacey acknowledged her, and physically looked around her to say to the corner, ""she said something."" Telling whatever she was talking to that the nurse had attempted to talk to her!

 After replaying everything that happened last night in my head I keep bringing myself back to Thursday night, June 20th, a couple days prior to all of the things that had happened yesterday.

 I was training Kate, my coworker in MC. We were exchanging ghost stories of things we have seen throughout the years of working in nursing homes, and Kate had mentioned something about hearing things in her head at her old nursing home... I told her that had happened to me a couple months prior. And that I haven't told anyone because I hadn't physically heard it out loud, but in my head. I went on to tell her while being on Brianna's room I had felt breathing on the back of my neck, and heard a man's voice in my head say, ""GET OUT!"" Later on Thursday morning, one of our residents in MC told the nurse a man was standing in front of her door watching her for hours... It makes me wonder if me saying what happened to me out loud made this, ""boogieman"" more active. Who knows. I guess I will find out tonight since I'm sitting at work in the MC unit as I type this. It's 3:30am. That's what time when he made his appearance yesterday. Wish me luck!"
"The Skeleton In The Purple Car","California","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","When I was maybe four years old, I was staring out of my family's living room window that led to the street. I don't really know why I was looking out the window but I remember it feeling like I was staring for quite some time. Out of nowhere a skeleton (no not someone dressed as a skeleton) pulled up in front of my house in a light purple car, it looked like an older one but I personally don't know much about cars. The skeleton just sat there and stared at me for little, then drove away. I can faintly remember him waving or saying something but I'm not sure what exactly happened since I was so little. Also I'm not sure it was male or if it was really anything but I just have the feeling. I haven't seen him since and I wanted to know if anyone has had a similar experience. 

I know it sounds crazy and the story will probably get shut down since I was so young at the time. But the world is a crazy place so you never know? Anyways I don't know what to say anymore but I need to reach the word minimum. So yeah if anyone has had a skeleton experience similar feel free to respond because I've never heard anyone else have the same story, but I think about it everyday. I don't know why I can't brush it off as a dream, it just seemed so real. I don't know why I can't forget about it either, maybe it means something? I don't know, I don't have any answers whatsoever. My family thinks it's bologna, but I know it's got to be something. Sorry for the run on ending but I needed to get my words in so I could post but yeah, please please please respond if you can relate. It would make me feel a little less crazy."
"An Evil Presence Outside","North Carolina","Haunted Places","I've been wanting to share this experience I had for awhile now, and have told some on here about it. It was definitely one of my more frightening experiences, as it did not feel nice, or friendly in any way.

 This happened last fall. As most know from my other submissions on here, I live far out in the country woods, on my family's large property. So the house we live in, is literally surrounded with woods, making night time very dark whenever there's no moon out. 

 Even as a child I felt fear at night around our woods (but only at night, I could be fine to explore all day in the sun). I know with that said, that could just be easily written off as a normal childhood fear, but even into my adulthood, that was just a feeling I never got over. I still hate to be around our woods lining at night, because of the feelings it gives me. 

 Last fall I was outside one night on our front porch. With the porch light on overhead, I could at least see pretty good around the bottom of the porch area, into some of the front yard. 

 As I stood on the porch in front of the door, that's also where the porch steps are, I started to get this feeling that something was watching me, that I could not see. Side note, I actually get that feeling pretty often, as though I'm never really alone outside. I tried to ignore that feeling, since I'm use to getting it while outside at night alone, but that night I just couldn't shake that feeling off. I realized whatever I felt watching me, had came from our backyard, and was walking through the side yard, at the far end of the porch, where it's in total darkness. I could feel whatever it was, turning to the front yard, and creeping closer to the front porch steps I was at the top of. 

 Now there's big tall bushes that are in front of our porch, so you can't really see through them at whatever may be on the other side of them, unless it's daylight. By this time, I'm really getting scared, because I know I can feel something getting closer to me, but I can't see it. I'm trying to hurry up and finish my cigarette, while I'm staring where the bushes end near the porch steps, that like I said, could be seen from the porch light on, when I noticed one of the branches that stuck out from the last bush, near the porch steps, had moved, as if someone or something had just walked by it, and bumped into it. The way it moved was as if someone grazed it while walking by it. I remember thinking how there's no wind blow at all, and nothing made sense to make only that one branch move the way it did, because no other part of the bush had moved. Right after I saw the branch move, I had this loud voice in my head screaming to ""RUN""! ""RUN""! ""GET INSIDE NOW""! I could feel whatever it was starting to walk up our porch steps, when I throw my cigarette and run inside, rushing to lock the door, which unfortunately at that time, was hard to lock without my husband's help (door was swollen or something at that time, making it tricky to lock it). So as I frantically tried to lock the front door, I had logic kick in, asking me how exactly do I think locking a door is seriously going to keep out whatever is outside that I can't see? Well that thought scared me, but I did feel safe inside. I hoped whatever was outside, was not coming inside.

 Still unnerved, I was shutting lights off in the house to get ready for bed, since my husband and kids were already asleep. As I'm walking through the living room, I felt that evil presence again, as I looked up and noticed the living room curtains slightly opened, that viewed to the front porch, beside the front door. I could just feel this tall figure standing right outside that window, staring at me. I freaked out and just ran to bed, and as I crawled into bed, wishing my husband was still up, he sat up to go to the bathroom, when I blurt out to him that something just chased me inside, when I was outside smoking. I said I couldn't get the door locked, and asked if he could go lock it for me. My husband gets up, still half asleep, but knows that I'm clearly scared by whatever was outside, and goes to the living room to lock the door.

 He comes back to bed and tells me that as he was walking up to the door to lock it, he got this weird feeling that something was staring at him through the exact same window that I had felt. I told him how freaky that was he said that, because I left that part out when I told him what happened to me outside, so for him to feel someone standing on the porch, staring through that window too, made me think it couldn't all be my imagination. 

 This isn't something that constantly happens outside, as I still to this day go outside at night alone to smoke. I'm just confused as to what was different that specific night, as so far it was the only night I ever experienced something like that here to that extreme. I know my family's property before they built on it, was nothing but woods, so I'm at a loss as to what could have been on our land. I know since I was a child, I've always been afraid of our woods at night, and have had other experiences outside as well, but still nothing as scary as that night, to the point I had a voice screaming in my head to run inside. I know I wrote about my one experience I had here of something dark that at one time I felt lived inside our house, but like I said in that submission, it left with my neighbor, and I haven't felt it here since then. 

 So I don't really believe it's the same thing, and wonder where it went after leaving that night, as well as why it didn't come inside. Like I said, I highly doubt locking a door will keep spirits or whatever from coming in.

 Now after reading some of the members submissions on here, that have spoke about having a guardian looking over them, it has made me wonder the possibility of me having a guardian, like perhaps my dad who I've felt around me here since I was little, that had passed away before I was born. Maybe he watches over me, and keeps me safe. All I know is whatever it was that night, did not feel nice or friendly in any way, and sent fear through me, yet once inside my house, it seemed as though it was unable to make entry, as it just stood on the porch, watching me through the living room window. 

 Not sure if this is related, and it's probably not, but I still want to add it as the timing was the same, but like I mentioned to some others on here last fall, back at the end of September, and the end of October, both times being around a full moon (not sure how important that detail is, just something I noticed), I kept getting this very odd little scratch on the back of my hand, near the bottom side of my thumb. It honestly looked as though a tiny kitten had scratched me right there (and no I do not own any kittens, or cats). Both times they appeared for no reason, in the exact same spot, both looking like a tiny kitten scratched me. Whenever I would notice I had the scratches, I would feel this burning sensation where it would appear, like something just burned me. The last one appeared after 5 in the morning, while I was waiting in our car for my youngest son's school bus to arrive that morning. I was sitting in the dark of our car, as the sun still hasn't risen yet, when I started to feel something burn my thumb area. I turn on the overhead light, and slowly started to see that tiny little kitten looking scratch appear in the exact same spot it did the previous month. I thought it was too random to have the exact same looking scratch I had the previous month (that I just accepted as one of those scratches you didn't realize you got from whatever did it), in the exact same spot it was before. I could even see where I had a little bit of scarring from the first one, as the new one was on top of it now. 

I was going to see if it happened a third time, thinking I figured out when I seemed to get it, coming up with somewhat of a theory, but it never happened again after that. So I'm at a loss as to what exactly that was, but thought it odd to happen around the same time I experienced whatever came up onto our porch that night. 

 Hopefully one of ya'll can think of why this could have happened when it did, verses it not being something that generally happens to that extent. As far as asking if I was going through a bad, or hard time at that time, I'd say nothing out the normal. If any year was recently a hard one, I'd say the fall of 2017 was the worst time for me, as I just lost my Mamaw that past June of that year. Thank you in advance to any helpful suggestions as to what I may have experienced that night."
"Keeps Coming Back","California","Haunted Places","For the last couple of nights I've been hearing noises in my bedroom at night. The noises sound like there is someone walking around in the bedroom and when I'm asleep. I get woken by a rustling noise, like someone is crumbling paper or moving a plastic bag. I thought maybe it could be a mouse even though I sleep with my cat at the foot of the bed. Usually when we hear noises my cat becomes alert, raises his ears and always looks down at the floor looking for the noise. The last couple of days, when I hear noises, I will turn on the lamp light and look around the bedroom from my bed. I have noticed that my cat does not look down at the floor but up, as if he was seeing someone. The funny thing is that he does not seem to be scared. Hearing noises is not new to me, usually when it happens my cat refuses to go in the bedroom or anywhere else the noises are coming from he always runs into my son's bedroom and stays there for a while. I try to bring him in the bedroom and he runs off as soon as I put him down, not lately. He does not seem to be afraid. 

My morning routine is when I'm ready to leave the house to go to work I call my son whose bedroom is across from mine. He calls out to me ""coming"" and then gets up, walks downstairs with me, opens the gate, waits for me to pull the car out and then shuts the gate, waves goodbye and goes back upstairs and starts getting ready for school. So, this morning I'm ready to leave and I call my son but I do not hear a reply. I call out to him again, this time a little louder. No reply. He's a really light sleeper so right away my first thought is he's not in the bedroom, maybe he snuck out and hasn't made it back in. He's never done it before but who knows, there's always a first time. Maybe he's really tired and is still asleep? I call him a third time really loud. Nothing. I head for the door knob and I'm just about to turn it when the door opens. There's my son, wide awake. He tells me ""let me put my shoes on"" and turns back in. I can't believe he was awake and was ignoring my call!

 I start asking him why he wouldn't answer before, it is really obvious he's been awake! He just answers ""I don't know"". He walks downstairs with me and all the while I'm asking him ""what do you mean you don't know? When I call you you need to answer me!""

I get in my car and right before I shut the door he tells me this. ""Mom, I heard you calling me and I woke and responded that I was coming, when I came out of the bedroom you weren't in the hallway waiting for me so I waited for you. Then I realized you were not coming out of your bedroom and I noticed the light in your bedroom was off so I go back to my bedroom to wait for you to call me again and looked at my phone and realized it was only 3:09 so I figured I had been dreaming. I was falling asleep again when I heard you call my name so I responded that I was coming, I go out my bedroom and you're not there. So I went in your bedroom and you were sound asleep. I thought that was weird but I thought maybe you were calling me out in your sleep. I go back to my bedroom and lay down thinking about what just happened, I could have sworn you sounded like you were just outside my bedroom. I stay there for a while and then I hear you walk out of your bedroom and head to the restroom. A few minutes later I hear you call my name, I didn't answer right away so you call my name again, it sounded like you were just outside by door again, so I get up really fast, open the door and you're not there. I've been awake since then. This last time when I heard you call me I didn't think it was you, I was actually on my way to your bedroom to wake you and let you know what was happening"". 

What the heck is going on? Why are they bugging my son now pretending to be me? Why isn't my cat afraid like he usually is? The only other thing I have to add is something that use to happen a long time ago. The house this happened in used to belong to my parents. Back when I was a teenager, my son's room used to be mine. I remember I used to experience a lot of activity in that room. Almost every night my bed would shake as I was trying to sleep, books would ""fly"" off the bookshelf and I would hear whispering next to my ear. This went on for a long time, so long that it became almost normal for me. I never told my parents, my mom would get really scared and upset when I would tell her about stuff like this so I just stopped. It was no use, she wasn't going to do anything, the rest of my family would just mock me and my grandma would try to make me pray the devil out of me. Anyway, when I moved out that room stayed empty for several years until my parents moved out and I took over. As an adult, I was still scared to go in there at night. I had an experience in that room (I will tell you about it in a different submission) that made me have a catholic priest bless the room several times and I had a medium cleanse it as well. The medium said she put a ""barrier"" around the room so nothing would enter it. So now I'm wondering if something was trying to get in that bedroom? 

I will cleanse my house and sage it like I often do. Things will be ""normal"" for a while until activity picks up again. I know the drill, I'm almost used to it by now. What I do not like is when it bothers my children. My daughter has been living in Nevada with my mother and sister for the last 7 months. She was experiencing sleep paralysis and night terrors and they completely stopped when she moved out. She is coming back in two weeks to spend the summer with us. I do not want her to come back to this. 

I'm not sure if there is something about this house that has different entities passing by or if it is the same one that keeps coming back."
"Spirit Of Roo","Massachusetts","Pets / Animals","I was about eighteen and we had recently moved to Boston Massachusetts. I was stressed out about it, I didn't want move to a larger city. There were more people than I was used to making it crowded and somewhat suffocating at times. To cope I clung to my Cat Roo. We called him that because He stood on his back feet, like a kangaroo. 

I had Roo for along time and we were super close. Sometimes I could tell what he was thinking without him meowing, and when he felt I was down he would cuddle close and make me feel better. Sadly six months later Roo passed on. I was devastated and inconsolable for weeks. 

I tried to move on, I worked a lot. My folks thought that I should pick out another cat. ""It would take my mind off of Roo,"" they said. But I couldn't bring myself to do so. Roo was special and nothing could replace him. 

One night about a month later I was having a bad time, I couldn't stop crying. 

I felt a soft cuddle against my cheek causing me to sit straight up in bed. I heard a soft meow, followed by purring. I felt a hard rub against my shoulder.

I felt relaxed and comforted by this. I was not afraid. Then I saw a shadow of a cat walking across the baseboard of my room. 

I knew it had to be Roo, he's the only one that could make me feel that way. I fell asleep and dreamed of him sleeping on the bed. I could swear I heard his soft purr in my ear too. 

Roo has visited me lots of times after that, especially during stressful events. Whenever I hear a soft meow I look to see if he's walking around the baseboard. Just to let me know he's there for me."
"Shook From My Bed","Oklahoma","Haunted Places","Let me start with some back story, so you can understand my full meaning. I have been in law enforcement for nearly 28 years. For the past 13 I have been a Special Agent... I've been on SWAT, for several years and served my county overseas in the US Army. I am a type ""A"" personality. I have worked homicides and hunted seriously dangerous men. I am hard wired to seek the tangible and find the truth... No one whom has ever met me can say I easily rattle. Here is what occurred...

I purchased a farm house in rural Oklahoma 9 months ago. It's about 7 miles from the nearest town. It's peaceful out in the country most of the time. I live alone at the moment with my Fiancee' moving down in a couple of weeks. My kids are grown. In college and working. Two nights ago, I went through my normal bedtime routine. Checked the doors and set the alarm. All was quiet. I go to sleep about 1130 PM. 

I'm asleep for about an hour when I awaken by what I can only describe as a small child pushing the mattress of my bed down on the empty side, a few times. I didn't see a child. I heard a giggle then felt the movement. I recall asking ""What is it baby?"" Like when one of you kids wakes you up at night. I then realized I was alone and thought I dreamt it, in that place between awake and asleep. I felt no threat or concern really and rolled over and went back to sleep. 

Two hours later at about 2:30 AM I feel the bed violently move several times, It jarred me awake. Once awake, it moved one more time and was coming from under the bed pushing up. It moved my full body weight as well as the bed mattress and box spring. I'm kind of a big guy. That took some effort. I got up quickly. I sleep with a firearm accessible at all times, and like I stated earlier I live alone during the week. The room is dark so I grabbed the weapon and a flashlight. All the hair on the back of my neck is standing up and I felt like I was not alone in the room. I went from condition white to condition red instantly. It immediately felt like I was in trouble and about to deal with a home invasion or something and feeling like there is a REAL threat to deal with. I check my surroundings and determine nothing is close to me. I jerked the covers off the bed so I can see underneath. There was nothing there. I fully expected to find a person. I swept my whole house, issuing threats and armed. I checked every room, closet and space a person could be in. Nothing. I cannot accurately convey the level that this unnerved me. 

Since that happened, sleep has been less than easy. I did some research and have had the house heavily saged. It's been quiet since then, at least so far. There have been no geological anomalies reported. All I can say is, there are still some things in this world that we don't understand. I can tell you without a doubt, I was not alone at 2:30 AM.

"My Mother's Doppelganger","Texas","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","This story takes place around 10 p.m. When I was a teenager, around 2001. There isn't much to the story, it's not fantastical, but it freaked me out and left me wondering what the heck just happened.

The rooms that are important to this story are the kitchen, my mom's room, and the family living room. From the family living room you can't see directly into the kitchen but the couch is facing that direction so you can see when someone leaves it, if there is light in it, and if someone is walking from it and towards the family living room. Another thing is you have to pass through the family living room to get to four of the five bedrooms, my mom's room included. My dad was asleep, my sister was asleep, my mom was in the kitchen cleaning up, and I was in the family living room when this event occurred.

I had just gotten out of the restroom and saw that my mom's room door was slightly open as there was a little light coming from her room. I could hear her cleaning up in the kitchen though. I sat in the family living room to watch TV. After watching TV for about ten minutes my mom comes walking from the kitchen wearing a blood red nightgown, one I had never seen before. She had also left the light on in the kitchen. She walks past me without saying anything, without making a noise, and without even glancing at me or saying anything to me. She opens her door, walks into her room, and leaves it slightly open. I think nothing of it and continue watching TV when five minutes later I see the light in the kitchen turn off and my mom comes walking from the kitchen wearing a white nightgown, the one she always wears. She says she's going to sleep as she walks past, opens her bedroom door, and closes it behind her. I'm sitting there in disbelief at what happened expecting her to scream or come out running because there's someone in her room but I hear nothing. I stay in the family living room for another hour so I assume she just goes to sleep.

I've never told her about it but I have told my wife and her family. I don't think she would believe me."
"My Father's Story","Pennsylvania","Haunted Places","Maybe it's just that my family's memories are like elephants, but at this year's family Christmas party, the talk ultimately turned to ghosts that the family has experienced. 

My Aunt Linda chuckled over her ghost being on 'the web' and my mother acted a little proud and embarrassed to acknowledge Elizabeth. But it was my father, of all people, the quietest out of all of us and the one who usually scoffs at our 'ghost prattle', that came out with a story that confused and intrigued even us. 

He began with, ""Well, I was little, and staying with my Grandfather at their old farmhouse just outside of Philadelphia. My older brother, Bobby and I would sleep in a little room that used to be our father's before he moved out. 

One night Bobby and I had been out playing all day and were a little more excited than we should have been to sleep. To tire ourselves out, we started wrestling and finally gave up on that when Granddad yelled at us that we were making too much noise. Well, we took to telling each other ghost stories, like boys will do to scare each other and see who's the bravest. 

Bobby was in the middle of a tale and suddenly the bed started shaking something awful, and on a hardwood floor, it makes a hell of a lot of noise. Once the bed stopped shaking, we began to hear something over near one of the corners whispering incoherently and in a strange language. 

Not thinking that there might have been something under the bed making it move that way, we both crawled under the bed and huddled together, waiting for Granddad to come rescue us. Certainly he would be up after us after all the noise the bed made banging on the floor. After several minutes, however, it became apparent that Granddad just wasn't coming and we climbed back onto the bed, pulling the covers over our heads and holding each other, shaking until dawn broke, still finding both of us awake. 

That morning, at breakfast, we both recounted the story to a skeptical Grandma and an amused Granddad. Granddad finally said we both must've been asleep or one of us was snoring, because he would have heard if the bed had made that much noise. The only sound he'd heard out of us last night was when one of us fell out of bed while wrestling."" 

He shrugged amidst grins and everyone nodded, acknowledging his story as the gospel and another person took his turn. Frankly, it was a story I'd never heard from him and was glad he spoke up to say he believed despite all his scoffing..."
"Aunt Linda's House","Pennsylvania","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","Knowing my family's love of ghost stories and the ghosts they've encountered in different places they've lived, it was no wonder my family would start sharing some stories. 

I found one that really intrigued me, for the simple fact that it was my favorite place to stay during the summer, my Aunt Linda's house. 

Her house was at one time a two family house, but when she bought the place they opened the house up. In the upstairs, there was a hallway connecting the two halves of the house and a small room at the center.

This room, for a long time, was my Uncle Ed's bedroom, (her younger brother). While cleaning up the house, they had found an old rocking chair in the attic. He had taken it and put it in a corner of his room, using it as a reading chair during the night. One night, after basketball practice, he lay down on his bed, across the room from the rocking chair and fell asleep. 

About three in the morning, as he recalls, he woke to the sound of squeaking. Turning his head ever so slightly, so not as to frighten his sister, as he was sure it was her coming to check on him one last time before she went to work, he caught the rocking chair in mid-rock. 

Shaking his head and trying to clear the sleep from it, he slowly sat up and watched as a smoky figure of a woman crossed from one doorway and sat down in the chair, a foggy bundle in her arms. As she sat and rocked, he began to hear the faint sounds of humming, singing. 

He leaned forward, straining to hear what she was saying. He smiled as he heard her say, ""It's okay Johnny, mama's got you now, sleep my little love."" And fell back to sleep. 

He later told Aunt Linda about it and she nodded saying, ""Yeah, I guess some lady's baby son died of scarlet fever here a ways back. It must be her rocking chair. We can get rid of it if you want."" 

He only shook his head no and said, ""Nah, I thought it was sweet..."""
"Elizabeth","Pennsylvania","Haunted Places","While none of my experiences were all that intense, there are several things that I have seen and heard that are more than real. I was born in a tiny town not far outside of the New York border. The town grew up as a railroad/mining town. Our house was built at the edge of town, the owner liking his privacy. While everyone in town took him to be a bachelor that spent most of his time at the rail yards, it became apparent, when the old man died, that he did have a son. The son moved in and raised a family there, also working on the rail yard. The family produced two sons. (Tin types of the family were found in my bedroom closet wall when we remodeled.) After this lineage, a daughter and son were born to one son and the other died. It was this son's daughter that greeted me not long after we moved into the house. It didn't help that she had died almost thirty years before I was born. 

Through the back door, across the old linoleum floor to the staircase, in the room at the top, I lay snug in my bed. I had been playing earlier that day and had left an old music box (found in the room when we moved in) open, on my dresser. My parents were downstairs, enjoying their television, when they heard me scream. I had rolled over, disturbed by something in my sleep that I couldn't quite explain, and sat up. My music box, completely unwound when I'd gone to bed, was playing cheerily. But it wasn't the jingling tune that had woken me. It was the figure of a girl standing next to my bed, gazing out my bedroom window into the backyard. My first thoughts were that she was lovely, long blonde hair and a pale blue dress, hands clasped behind her with a slightly sad air about her. It changed quickly, though, when she turned to look at me and instead of disappearing, advanced on me, hands outstretched, her face changing from benevolent to cruel in a heartbeat. My mother sprinted up the stairs with more energy than I've seen in her since, driving her away. But it would not be the last time I would see her, though after that, each visit was absolutely benevolent. 

A few years later, we (the family and I) began remodeling the house, tearing out walls and finding pieces of the house we had not counted on. Anyone who's ever remodeled a house knows the strange things that can be found in a house's walls. Between the disgust of finding a mouse corpse in one of my walls to finding the remains of a burnt-out old chimney on another, we also found a death certificate. For one Elizabeth Wesley, born July 17, 1940 died March 22, 1952. The cause of death was blurred with time, but we could make out something about a fever. We finally had our ghost - Elizabeth. We've realized, too, that 'my' music box was hers too, tied to it somehow. Since the remodeling though, I've not seen her."
"Army Man In The Office?","New York","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","As I've mentioned in previous stories I work in the garment district of New York City, and have had experiences where I've seen something out the corner of my eye or in one of the neighboring office windows that shouldn't be there. A very jarring one of those occurences happened recently. We'd been having a relatively tense week at our office so this almost seemed like a welcome relief. There is one window directly across from my desk, straight line of sight, whose office has had no inhabitants since we started working there. Never seen anything in that window and never thought much of it, but during a particularly stressful moment, I noticed a man staring out of it. The place was desolate otherwise. 

Then I noticed that this man was not wearing a normal work uniform or anything that would be appropriate for a professional environment. Instead, it appeared he was wearing military fatigues. Strange I thought. When I looked back over to confirm that there was a Navy man in that desolate window, there was no one standing there. I have never seen anyone looking out that particular window before or since. I was a bit shaken up by that sight and everyone else I encountered that day said I looked off. 

I'd been racking my brain over the next few hours who it could have possibly been. I was thinking that maybe the building served another purpose during WW2, but then another solid thought hit me. I remembered my mom telling me many years ago that her father, who died when I was very young, had worked in the garment district. He had also served in the Navy breifly during the later years of WW2, although he did not see any combat. Would it make any sense for my Grandpa to reveal himself during a random hectic work day and from such a distance? Not sure if that would make sense to me, but maybe you guys can lend some insights? Who or what else could it have possibly been and what could it mean?"
"Jealous Ghost","California","Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis","This is about my brother, he is 34, good looking, athletic and very kind but he has been having a ghost problem for the past 4 years. We are not sure how it started or why!

There are things that get misplaced and he was grabbed by his feet and shaken at midnight, one night. It shook him so hard that he got back problems. The air at his house is very heavy and hard to breathe. You can feel something in the house watching you, it's all negative energy, the weird thing is that the activity gets worse and more when he gets a girlfriend. Last year we asked a lady someone to pray, and everything was great until he got a serious girlfriend. 

It touches him, he can feel it. Or it put its hand on his eyes and does not let him open them.

He just met a nice girl and he thinks she is the one but whatever this thing is, it's attacking the girl. She got a few bite marks on her legs and arm; very hard bites with bruises. She said something is following her in the house.

 My brother also told me, every night he wakes up around 3 or 4 pm because his shirt is all wet like he is been in water, but he doesn't feel fever or cold or hot, nothing. He says every day there is a water mark around him on bed like a circle, like someone drop water around him. He is getting depressed, he got eating disorder, and he feels tired. His girl friend is very scared to go to the house. We are so worried about him and don't know who can help him. Any suggestions, we live in Los Angeles?

Anyone know what this behaviors means? What can I do for him to be free? I want him to be strong."
"There Is A Canadian Man In My Closet","Massachusetts","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I will explain beforehand, when I could remember, I wrote the details of this event over 58 years. Eventually before conclusion, I had scribbled (filled) three black and white composition booklets. This will be a long read. Please note there have been name changes and some incomplete info for privacy.

I was very young the first time I heard the bell, a tiny sound, just a ting. Then a light whisper so soft I wasn't sure of any words. As if he was sure I was frightened, it would fade away. The bell was part of this experience each time before he spoke, but I will not mention of the bell again, as a way of saving time for you, the reader. The sound of his voice always came from a corner near the ceiling, even though it would happen in different rooms, different houses, over time.

I grew nonchalant, when I heard him, it became the norm, this young man's voice so gentle, there was nothing to fear. Life was busy and I would just roll over to get much needed sleep. There were times that years would pass, yet when I again heard his whisper, I would have the thought that I missed him.

None of this made any sense, I simply had no time to dwell on him, until I became sick. I spent more time in my bedroom too weak to lift my head. His voice became clear, easier to understand. I would look into my closet, thinking he sitting or laying inside, on the top shelf. Now would you believe it, he spoke with an Irish/Scottish brogue, with a touch of French mixing into his words. I had to get cancer, to understand what he had been saying all this time.

He spoke of his home, his family and of happier times, life at the turn of the (1900) century. He told me that he and I were cousins. He named his seven brothers and how close he was to his one sister. He described the river banking where he fished and enjoyed the wild flowers and beautiful pastures and meadows, all surrounding his home, his town. The river, where he would wade, as it ran into the Atlantic Ocean.

There were times I thought it was the chemo, slowly I got better. This was back in 2002. From this time forward we had great conversations, before I slipped off to sleep. He would talk of his childhood, the gardens and flowers. He mentioned New Brunswick a few times. Each boy had been given a chore to complete daily and they did it for one month, then switched for a different chore, home, barn, gardens, animals, and horses. I began to realize we were not any longer speaking in words, but in thoughts. A communication of thoughts! Wow! I can not recall, ever having this ability in any other circumstance other than perhaps random words from an unknown origin.

I gained information about his Parents, his Father was half American Indian and half Scottish. His Mother was Scottish, third generation in Canada. They had strong faith and lived the Scottish way, close to family, and Church. This meant so much to me as I knew very little of my Mother's side, as she had died when I was a child.

There were times when he was quiet, later he told me that he would become overwhelmingly sad, and unable to communicate. Why so sad, were my thoughts, the silence was my only answer. Often it would be several months to a year, before we conversed again. I placed a pillow and some blankets on the top shelf just in the event, he may be able to use them.

It progressed in this manner and he became one of my best friends, don't you laugh. One can not spend this much time together and this much time in conversations, and not know each other. Yet I was never touched by him, and I never saw him, however I did wonder what he looked like. Then this last year has become different. He became louder, excited if you will. He asked for my help, but he wouldn't tell me how.

He would repeat the numbers 7-2-7-4...and bark out--private--expeditionary. Again and again My Mother is Alice Mc------e. I am your cousin, please help. Increasingly, and repeated much like a broken record, yes they were thoughts in my head but so loud I feared he would wake my husband. What made him change? Hill70Hill70ill70Hill70Hill70EXPEDITIONARY.

I have the cancer again, it is Feb. 2018, and I think this time it will take me. Perhaps out of respect, my Canadian man is quiet, while I am given heavy Chemo and an even meaner surgery, following more chemo. It was an awful year, for me it was the biggest fight I have ever had. March 2019 finds me with some hair, but not all of it. My friend in the closet is still quiet.

Early one evening in late March the phone rings. We get so many Robocalls, we seldom answer, but take a message, then we call back if it is real. I am getting a call from Canada at eight in the evening. My husband advises me to not answer but something tells me that I should. On the west coast it is three hours earlier, and I pick up the phone. Are you Jan--------I answer in my monotone voice, yes, are you the daughter of--------yes. Are you the granddaughter of Edith-------------YES. Do you know Edith had a sister Alice (my heart beats fast). This woman gives me the information that she is in a division of the Government of Canada, and her job is to look for relatives of the War missing with no known grave. We talk for some time, and she explains the details of the DNA and it is only passed down from Mother to Daughter. I begin to get emails after she and I have exchanged information. Our conversation continued with much more information.

Oh, my table looks like a patchwork quilt. Births deaths, marriages and an old tiny picture of an Expeditionary in uniform! Hand written (Highlander)! All the family links I never knew. I am beyond excited. I have a job, I am to call my living cousins to explain and invite them to join, that for so many reasons is the right thing to do. They will need three or more to swab and return the kit. I called cousins that quickly agreed.

Would I ever have had this on going experience had my Canadian man not come to visit? I do not think I would have understood everything without his help. I end this on going event by telling you they did not want my DNA as chemo can change DNA, who knew? Fortunately There are five women that are willing and are sending or have sent their kits back. 

The History, if you wish to look into it, is Vimy Ridge-Hill 70 Lens France. Once you start reading, it is endless, horribly sad information.

The bell is quiet, as is my Canadian friend."
"The Beginning Of My Paranormal Experiences, Age 3","Maryland","A Haunted Life","As this is my first story shared on this site, I felt it makes the most sense to begin at a beginning. I'm a rare individual who has always known ghosts, and therefore has never doubted them. I'm also a lucid dreamer; this is also a part of me that is hard wired. Unfortunately, when one is under 4, this makes for some very confusing and terrifying experiences, not helped by the fact that one can barely speak properly. And for anyone wondering, yes, I can remember being 18 months+, and I have memories that have been corroborated by my very surprised parents, and ones that weren't captured on photographs (false memories or other memories can be adjusted to fit a photograph and the more one sees it the more ""real"" it appears in their mind; memory is a funny thing). 

There were two main spiritual experiences I had as a kid, one benevolent, the other just negative, though it never seemed to notice me much. I had what my parents called imaginary friends, but they weren't imaginary: they were in my dreams. Their names were Goohsap and Pop Pop, and they were two men in the 60's-70's who drove a red convertible and wore Hawaiian shirts with Khaki pants and lived in the country. They held hands and shared a small cottage in the country, and I had dreams about them and me having meetings at my Church. They were always associated with god and other spiritual beings, and were quite kind. It got to the point where I packed a bag, scared my parents, and sat on the front porch and waited for them, backpack, sneakers and all. I remember falling asleep in the twilight on a spring or summer evening, my reality carried over to the dream, and they explained that they only existed in dreams, and couldn't be found in reality. I was pissed, and only saw them intermittently after that. 

The first malevolent thing I remember during potty training years was the struggle with what I called ""Frankenstein"". I don't know when I began calling it that, it just was the only thing that fit. I'd feel fine during the daytimes, but at night, even my earlier memories, when the shadows were at a certain angle, and everyone else was asleep, I'd hear chains and groaning. Never did they seem to come for me, but consistently I'd awake at a similar time as the shadows from the trees outside my window were in similar or identical places (it was the 90s, I had no clock in my room, and I couldn't read yet anyways). 

There were never any lights left on (my dad is an environmentalist/we were broke) and I would feel fine in the house up until midnight or so, up to the age of 10 when we moved. This was a time specific event, to the point where my cats would come in and sleep with me, and run in when I heard the chains. Pablo and Ezra, my cats, would sleep with me in my crib. My parents were frustrated that Ezra and Pablo insisted on sleeping in my crib, but we refused to be separated, and each of us would mewl and cry uncontrollably until we were reunited. I remember little about Ezra as he died when I was a bit older than two, but I remember not understanding, not crying, and asking my mama where he was to the same answers and the same tears when he died. It made no sense to me, and Frankenstein continued. It also meant, unfortunately for my parents, plenty of bedwetting, as it was too terrifying to walk through the dark house, into the hall, 8 feet, with a creepy mask next to my room and Frankenstein howling. Whenever I gained the courage to yell for my parents, it always took them time to wake as it was after midnight and they were dead asleep. Lights would turn on, Frankenstein would cease. Until they went back to sleep, that is. 

My sister was born when I was 3 1/2, and I experienced this both before and after her birth. I eventually had my own bed, which Pablo would sleep with me as well. He would always come running when Frankenstein began. Once when my sister was too little to share my room (we shared a room in this house), so I was 3 to 4, I walked into my room when it was dark (it was bedtime). I looked down, and saw red eyes, and was absolutely sure my parents would notice that. I screamed for them and didn't leave, as I wanted them to know this was real, but Pablo got there first, and dove under the bed. Seconds later, my parents entered and turned on the lights, and I saw the red eyes for a moment longer but Pablo won. They saw nothing, and told me it wasn't real. 

Frankenstein continued intermittently, but I'd awake often at what I now knew to be about 2 am (I eventually got a watch, probably about 8 when I went to Girl Scout Camp). I would often hear Frankenstein, but as I got older and braver, I'd either wait for it to pass, try to be awake past my parents and leave lights on (I'd read a book with my flashlight to pass the time) or use a flashlight (it was the 90s) to navigate the hall, with Pablo close by. A note about my sister: She has always been a heavy sleeper to the point that she can only wake with the most intense alarms that both scream and vibrate her bed, even as an adult. It was always frustrating for me, as I'm a light sleeper, would hear the chains and the groaning, and would pray and hope I'd fall asleep as fast as I could. 

I got mega creeped out when I moved. I didn't want to encourage these spirits and had shared as little of this with my caretaker, who I'll call Mrs. Lewis, as I could while trying to figure it out. She remembers me being concerned and asking her about ghosts repeatedly for years between 2-10. I've always been religious (yes, even as a young child I relished church, the incense, the rites, the music, the rituals, the readings, everything about it). Mrs. Lewis did as well, and we are both Episcopalians, so when I felt I would be free of Frankenstein, I told her everything. When we moved out, Mrs. Lewis, who lived but a block away, asked me if I knew of the trolley. I live in a suburb of D.C., and it was one of the first, and used to have a trolley that would carry people from the city to my town. What I didn't know, and had no way to know, was that this trolley used to go through what was my neighborhood. My neighborhood was developed in the 1950s-early 60s, after the trolley had been taken out, and right atop the old tracks. 

We don't know where exactly the tracks went, but Mrs. Lewis is a D.C. Native and had lived in that neighborhood since the 1970s. Guess who built the railroad tracks according to all the people of her generation and earlier? Prisoners. What does a chain gang sound like? Chains and groaning, though I can't find any sources on this, it is often the disenfranchised who were coerced/forced into building railroad tracks. How could I have known any of this before I could speak, or before I could read? How could I have made this up when I can't even find sourcing on this now? I know it was real, and this appears to be the only explanation. I now have pity for ""Frankenstein"", as it appears to have been forced labor, and what I think of as an emotional imprint that likely attracted other things, like the red eyes under the bed. It didn't seem very conscious, as it never got closer, and simply echoed down the hall to me, and avoided light. More of an echo, less of a conscience, but filled with pain and agony. The cats weren't fans either. I now wish I could help those imprints, spirits or whatever. They don't seem happy to me. 

A note: Mrs. Lewis is still alive, we talk and see each other often, and she remembers this too, and still insists that the tracks were built by prisoners. She lives in the same neighborhood, and though she's had her share of experiences in the neighborhood, she's never met ""Frankenstein"" as such. I don't know why I would always awake to it; were they reaching out, or just waiting for everyone to sleep to express their anguish? Or did something happen at 2-3 am that wasn't entered into the historical record but that they still feel? Why haven't my neighbors had similar experiences? I have no answers to this, only questions. All I know is it opened me up, and the experiences didn't really stop, though Frankenstein did. I have more tales of poltergeists and one house I lived in during my college years that seemed to consume me and my friends, and we couldn't finish the lease, it was too hard. That is for later. All for now."
"Hug From A Spirit","Georgia","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I live in Savannah, Ga. I'm a single mom of five.

 I often give my bed up to avoid the fights between my boys. This particular night I was sleeping on the couch, I encountered what appeared to be a male whatever it was behind me on the couch. He wrapped both of his arms around me as if he was hugging me and I could not move, I couldn't speak, all I did was close my eyes and begin to recite the Lord's Prayer. When I began to pray he let me go and I haven't experienced that again.

 I also wake up every night since I moved to GA three years ago around the same time. It never fails between 2:30 and 3:00 I automatically wake up.

 I work evenings at the local hospital. At around 8:00 the lights are cut down so the patients can sleep. I have experienced a person walking behind me, and can hear the steps the person is making. When I stop the footsteps stop. I try to turn around and see who it is but there is never anyone there. At this same hospital when I'm passing by rooms, that I know are empty, I catch glimpses of what appears to be a person in the room. It's to the point when I leave at night I tell the security guard I don't need an escort because somebody is always walking with me while I'm there. I truly believe the person is someone that I befriended while I was working and before he/she transitioned on to be with God. I really should be afraid with all the unusual things that I have started to experience, but the spirits I'm encountering seem to be pleasant and calm. It's like they are keeping me company, like the so many times I visited and kept them company."
"Mini-tornado","Washington","Orbs / Lights / Mists","This experience took place in the late 1980's, while I was working as a secretary at a business firm in Los Angeles, California. I had been working at that location for awhile, and was rather comfortable with my daily work routine, albeit somewhat dull and tedious. The office environment was very professional, my co-workers were older than me and quite conservative. I mostly worked by myself at the front reception area, especially in the late afternoon when there was very little going on.

One afternoon, before closing up the office, I was sitting at my desk working on some filing when something caught my attention. The office front doors which were heavy glass and steel, began to rattle. I didn't really give that much thought, but I decided to get up from my desk and go secure the doors since it was so close to closing time. As I crossed the room to lock up, suddenly one of the glass doors blew open, and 'something' came into the foyer. The door that blew open was now shut (on its own), and what I saw just a few feet in front of me made no sense. In the middle of the foyer was a swirling, glowing green, mini tornado (dense, but somewhat see through). It stood about 3 feet tall on the floor, rotating constantly. The air within the room had changed, feeling sort of prickly. I realize this sounds very weird, but this is what I saw and felt. It moved slowly across the floor toward me, before disappearing completely; the entire incident lasted maybe 20 seconds. Once I got over the shock of seeing that thing, I ran over to lock both the front doors. Was this my imagination playing tricks on me? I said nothing to any of my co-workers about this incident because I didn't want to face any ridicule, or be dismissed from my job...

The next day, before heading off to work, I decided to have one last cup of coffee with my husband. After we settled on the sofa in our living room, I recall scrolling through tv channels, and then hearing a sudden loud popping noise. Then from beside the entertainment center (tv/VCR/stereo area), appeared the whirling, green mini tornado thing! I couldn't believe that I was seeing this thing in my own home now! Except this time I wasn't alone, my husband was seeing it also. I felt completely creeped out by its presence. I remember jumping up from the sofa and spilling coffee all over my lap. My husband had a look on his face like he was in total disbelief; I could sense that seeing this thing freaked him out too! Again, within seconds, it disappeared into thin air. Thankfully, that was the last time I saw the 'mini tornado' anywhere.

At the time of the incident, I don't recall any windows, or doors being left open in that particular room. Nothing seemed unusual about the weather that day, and nothing seemed off-kilter in our home during that time. Honestly, I couldn't figure out why I was seeing this strange thing? The internet didn't exist back then; we had to delve into the local library's paranormal/occult section for possible answers. We did a lot of reading, but never really found a solid explanation as to what we experienced (perhaps we weren't reading the right material?). All that I was left with were questions: why was I seeing this thing, and wth was it?"
"Generational Paranormal?","Washington","Haunted Places","I'm new to this site, and would like to share some of my recent experiences about my new home.

Last May, my husband and I decided to purchase a home in the historical downtown area of the city we live in. Our home is a charming, 3 story (6 bedroom/3 bathroom) house, that is due to turn 100 years old next year. Most of the time, our home has a very pleasant and welcoming feeling about it, but the third floor of the house is a different story altogether (no pun intended).

Within the first week of moving our family into our home, I began to have some unusual experiences. These were odd things I considered non-threatening, like lights turning on/off and doors opening on their own. I kept these experiences to myself for awhile, because I didn't want to frighten my three children. Most of our family was settling into our house quite nicely, and everyone seemed happy except for my daughter. My daughter has always been a playful little girl, but since we moved in I noticed she was becoming increasingly timid and quiet. 

My two teenage sons occupy the second floor of our house; they seem very comfortable and haven't had any issues. The third floor is where 90% of the weird stuff happens; this floor is where my bedroom and my daughters bedroom are located. I chose the third floor, because the views from our bedroom windows are amazing. Unfortunately, there is definitely something 'off' about that area. There are times where I feel like I'm walking through a fun house, almost like a dizzy, sick feeling when walking around up there. I've had friends tell me that they feel claustrophobic and uncomfortable when they enter the third floor of our house. Both my husband and daughter hear voices and footsteps on that level of our house. I have felt an definite presence several times in that same area. 

At first, my daughter loved her new bedroom and played in there everyday for the first few weeks. Then one day, I noticed she wouldn't go up to her room without me going with her. I asked her if something was the matter, and she just nervously shook her head no. My gut instinct told me otherwise, I was pretty sure she had felt, or saw something. That night, she refused to sleep in her bedroom and wanted nothing to do with the third floor. That evening, I decided to sleep in her room with her. Once I tucked her into her own bed, I assured her that she was safe with me. After watching her fall asleep next to me, I decided to dive into some reading since I had some quiet free time. At first her room seemed very still, and that's when I felt something really odd. I heard movement near the bed, like some type of rustling, but couldn't see any movement. Then suddenly it felt like there was something underneath her bed trying to move it. The bed felt as though it was vibrating, almost in strong pulses, that's the only way I can describe it. Then I became aware of a very strong odor of urine; the urine smell was so strong that I almost gagged. I pulled my daughter from the bed, and looked her over, but nothing was out of the ordinary. Her bed wasn't wet, and the vibrating had stopped. I felt so badly for my daughter; no wonder she was so scared! I have never experienced a pulsating bed, accompanied by a bad odor ever before, so this was unnerving for me. Since that night, she no longer stays in that room.

The next morning, I decided to have a very honest conversation with my 7 year old girl. I shared with her about my experiences as a little girl, and how I have learned to cope with 'paranormal stuff' throughout my life. I told her about her grandma Sherry (my mother), who also had many experiences while growing up, but she too had overcame her fears. She then told me that she has been seeing a tall, black misty shadow in her room and that it made her feel bad. I promised her, as long as I am here, that she will never be alone when it comes to dealing with the spooky stuff in life. Talking with her seemed to help her calm down and helped relax her a bit. Now, we talk openly about what we see and feel, and we practice positive visualization together everyday. I think it's helped her. Daily prayer has also helped her feel more empowered.

We still have strange things happen on the third floor, and we haven't quite figured out her old bedroom yet (it's vacant now). I don't know if this has to do with generational paranormal phenomena or not, but things do feel lighter around our house since we've been more open with each other."
"Roseman Bridge","Iowa","Haunted Places","On June 1, 2019, at approximately 7:00 PM, I was returning to Indiana from a vacation that I had taken to Wyoming and South Dakota. 

My all time favorite movie is the Bridges of Madison County. For years I had said that I was going to visit the house and the bridge that were the focal points in the movie, both are located in Winterset, Iowa. So I decided to head south through Des Moines on my way home so that I could visit these two locations. My first stop was at the house where Francesca lived in the movie. I knew from looking online that the house was abandoned and that I would not be able to actually get up close to the house. I stood at the gate and took pictures, then got back in my car and set my GPS for Roseman Bridge. My GPS indicated that it was approximately 30 minutes away.

 I drove through rural Iowa with my GPS navigating the way until I came upon Roseman Bridge. It was everything that I had thought it would be. I was very excited to take pictures of the bridge and actually get to walk through the bridge! At this time of the evening no one else was around and the gift shop for the bridge that is close by was closed. The only thing I knew at the time about the bridge was that it was used in the movie. Had I researched it further I probably would have decided against going into it.

That evening in Iowa was beautiful! It was around 70 degrees, no wind, the sun was going down, the birds were singing, I could hear insects buzzing, everything that you can picture of an early summer evening in rural Iowa. I parked my car in the gravel directly in front of the bridge, got out and read the posted sign telling about when and how the bridge was constructed and began taking pictures. 

After taking several pictures from the outside of the bridge I was excited to actually get inside the bridge and cross over to the other side. As I approached the bridge I noticed all the graffiti that had been left by prior visitors. I read several of the names, dates, and inscriptions. I then began to cross the bridge. The only way I can really explain what I felt upon entering the bridge is just a sense of uneasiness. I dismissed the feeling as just being alone in a rural setting and the fact that I was entering an enclosed space that was beginning to get dark inside. The further I went into the bridge the more the sense of unease consumed me. About a quarter of the way into the bridge it began to sound like the wind was blowing hard outside and the bridge began to creak. A lot. I thought well it is a wooden bridge so it is going to creak some but how weird that when I entered the bridge there was no wind. Honestly at this point I thought about turning back but then I thought I've driven so far to see this I'm just going to tough it out and walk all the way through the bridge. I continued walking and as I got to the center of the bridge it began to tremble. I mean an all out shake. I could see small pebbles and dirt and what I think was dried bat poop bouncing up and down on the wooden floor in front of me toward the opening of the bridge. My first thought was am I not supposed to be walking on this bridge, is it unsafe? Surely if they didn't want anyone on the bridge and it wasn't safe they would have closed it off. Maybe put up a sign? I mean looking at the bridge it didn't appear to be in poor condition. I literally thought the bridge was going to fall and me with it. Needless to say I picked up my pace to get to the other side and out of there. I wanted to run but was afraid that the pounding of my running, if the bridge was going to fall, would only make it worse. I exited the other side into the same world I had been in when I entered the bridge, no wind, and the sun beginning to go down. I felt my heart racing and walked away from the bridge over into the grass and just stood there wondering what had just occurred.

 After I calmed down I realized that the only way back to my car was to go back through the bridge. No way. I walked around looking for another way to get back across the river. I even considered wading through the water that looked rather deep to get back. I still had another nine hours to go to reach home and the thought of soaking wet clothes was not appealing, nor was the thought of possibly drowning. I feel like I walked back in forth in that grass for hours building up the courage to get back across that bridge, when in reality it was probably only a few minutes. The funny thing is that the sense of uneasiness I had felt on the bridge immediately disappeared once I exited the bridge. 

Deciding that I didn't really have a choice but to cross back over the bridge I made my way to the entrance and looked around. I didn't see or hear anything unusual. I mean that really did just happen, right? Again, second guessing myself. As I start to enter the bridge I again get a feeling of uneasiness, almost a feeling of doom. I turn around and go back out to the grass. The feeling leaves. What is going on? Okay, I have no choice but to get back to my car and get out of here. I enter the bridge again, uneasiness comes again and I start walking at a brisk pace. Please do not let it start shaking, please do not let it start shaking. At this point I actually have my head down, arms swinging and I am moving to get out of there. Again as I near the center of the bridge my feelings of unease are stronger, I can feel the hair standing up on the back of my neck. It feels, FEELS, like there is someone else with me on that bridge. I am not about to look around and find out, I just want out of there. As I pass the midway point of the bridge I actually hear and feel all at the same time something fly over the top of my head and actually touch my hair, at the time same moment a blast of cool air hits my entire body, like I'm walking by a window air conditioner. At this point I'm done caring about if that bridge is going to fall, I take off running. 

Was it a bird? Bat? Maybe. I don't know, I never looked, but where did the cold air come from? As I exited the bridge and ran to my car I again noticed that things were back to normal on the outside of the bridge, no wind, no cold air. 

I turned my car around and drove out onto the main gravel road that I had taken back to the bridge realizing that I am out in the middle of nowhere and I'm not exactly sure how I need to go to return to the interstate to go home. I look at my phone which I had been holding in my hand the entire time and realize the screen is black as if my phone has been turned off. I hold down the button on the side to restart my phone. Nothing. I do this several times, each time holding down the button even longer. Nothing. Please keep in mind that my phone worked just fine on the way to the bridge, I had a signal and GPS took me right to it. So I take off driving, sans GPS, trying to recall the turns I had taken to get there. I get so far and realize I just need to stop and try to get my phone to work before I get completely turned around and wander the Iowa countryside. I again try to turn my phone on and it works! However, I have no service. I am sure that I am taking the route back that I came on when I had service. I continued to drive for about a mile when I pick up service again, eventually find the interstate and get the heck out of Iowa! 

As soon as I got hone I googled Roseman Bridge haunted? And found several stories stating that the bridge is haunted and that all the locals know this. YIKES! 

Ghosts? Spirits? I don't know. Maybe. I don't have a reasonable explanation for any of it, however, I do know that will be my one and only trip to Roseman Bridge."
"My Holocaust Museum Experience In Washington Dc","Maryland","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","April 20th 2016 (My 9th Grade Year):

I had taken the train from Frederick, Maryland with my entire German 1 Class to Union Station in Washington DC. My German teacher had this tradition where every other year in April she'd take her German classes to the Holocaust Museum in Washington DC, I just happened to be part of that trip.

 When we arrived at Union Station we broke up into groups of 5, we were to go get some food, go to the restroom, then meet up with everyone else in the middle of the Station. After all of us returned to Frau, we walked to a bus stop that would take us from Union Station all the way to the Holocaust Museum. When we arrived at the entrance of the museum I chose 4 other kids to be in my group, I only remember the name of one group member, Jason. So after getting our bags checked we entered the museum, we then had to sit through a 25 minute lecture (which was normal for the museum). After the lecture, Frau let us go with our groups to explore the museum.

 Once my group got to the first exhibit I didn't feel right, so I took out my rosary and started to pray for protection, but after 2 minutes of me silently praying Jason cut me off, he's a hardcore Atheist, this is what he said, ""stop praying, you're hurting me."" I stopped praying like he said and put my rosary back in my purse, I didn't get to finish praying, now this is where things took a turn.

My group and I began walking around the museum checking out every exhibit, everyone in my group were acting normal but also respectful, but, for me, this wasn't the case. As we were walking I began to feel light headed, I brushed it off as being me not taking Advil before the train ride so I kept walking. But, as we got deeper into the museum I was still feeling lightheaded and it was slowly getting worse, the entire left side of my back felt like it was on fire, I squinted a little at the feelings. We continued on and my condition wasn't getting any better, the deeper we were in the museum the worse my pain got.

 Soon we were near a bridge made of glass and on either side of the bridge there were long glass panels and on the other side of the panels were real shoes with real dried blood from the Jews. I was walking slowly across the bridge, I was still lightheaded, the left side of my body still felt like it was on fire and now another feeling was added, near my lower back it felt like someone was kicking it with a metal tip on their boot, but it wasn't just a small kick, no, it was a harsh kick that really hurt. After we crossed the glass bridge, I walked past a glass container that had the Nazi flag in it, I stopped for a second and looked at the container, then I saw someone who looked transparent, he obviously wasn't from this time period and he also looked way too old to be part of my group. The semi transparent man looked to be covered in blood and soot, his clothes were torn and he had a black eye, I felt my pain grow stronger. Jason noticed that I was staring at the glass and not moving, he called out to me and I snapped back to reality, I walked over to him and he lead me back to the group. At this point, we were almost out of the darkest parts of the museum, the pain I was feeling was so bad I felt like I was going to pass out. I just couldn't take it anymore, dry tear stains were on my cheeks because I was silently crying, but I pressed on so I could get to the last part of the museum and be done with this. 

My group entered a place in the museum called ""The Hall of Remembrance"" the moment I stepped into that hall, all of the pain I was feeling somehow disappeared like it was never there to begin with, for the rest of my time in DC I was happy and laughing.

When the train brought us back to Frederick I found my dad and walked with him to his car, as we were heading home I told him about everything that happened to me in that museum. He seemed shocked but then said to me that it was probably Jesus showing me what the Jews felt during the Holocaust and I was feeling the pain that they felt.

I am now 18 years old and I've graduated from my high school, this is an experience that I'll never forget, and about that bloody man I saw in the museum, that was most definitely an apparition, I believe in ghosts, I'm not a skeptic at all. I also believe that what my dad told me on the way back from the train station was true, ever since then, I've never had any other experiences like that, that experience will stay with me until the day I die."
"My Neighbor's House","Georgia","Haunted Places","May 30, 2019

I was at Mrs.Linda's house today, because she called me to help her with things she need to do. So I walked to her house which is right across the street and I knock on her door and I let myself in announcing that it was me, so she wouldn't feel threatened. 

I went to her bedroom because that was where she was at the time, to find out what she wanted me to do. She told me to fix the front bedroom bed by by making up the bed and do the same thing with her bedroom.

 After doing all that and getting the beds made just the way she wanted, she had me do other things too. Like putting her clothes up in her bedroom closet, and putting the the towels she folded in her bathroom closet too.

While I was putting her bathroom towels up I always have her bathroom door shut while I'm inside her bathroom to open the closet to put the towels in. Doing so, the bathroom door opened by itself.

 Her front door knob is always locked, so I had to unlock it to leave at the end of the day. I was about to unlock it myself and it was unlock by itself without me even touching it. 

I told my neighbor, "" Your house ghost just unlock the door for me.""

 She said ""That is probably Mrs. Smith letting you out."" And I went home across street and into my house and told my dad what just happened. That was cool experience."
"The Church Cemetery","South Carolina","Haunted Places","For the longest time whenever I and my best friend John would go out anywhere for extended periods of time we would have some kind of odd random occurrence. Two examples of this would be 1. While we were out for a walk a pickup truck went flying past us doing about 45 mph missing it's left front wheel and 2. We were shopping at a Salvation Army thrift store when a dead guy was found in the bathroom. 

However, since we've come to expect and often anticipate something weird happening whenever we go out, the occurrences have pretty much stopped.

This story is about one such occurrence during a random road trip we decided to take up to Hendersonville NC late one night around 12:30 am. We had no real destination in mind, just driving. The trip was about an hour and a half one way for us, but we didn't care, we just wanted to drive and talk.

Once we decided we had driven far enough we turned around to head back. John said he knew a shortcut and turned off onto a side road. About 15 minutes down that road we turned onto what John thought was the right road only to wind up in a semi-circular drive that ran through a cemetery in front of a fairly large church. We stopped in the drive to figure out where we had made the wrong turn and also debated getting out and exploring the cemetery. Neither one of us have a problem with cemeteries at night, in fact my house is less than a quarter mile from one and we've walked through it at all hours of the night without a problem, however this one seemed rather creepy for some reason so we decided not to explore and just continue on home. We pulled out of the other side of the drive and back on to the side road. 

Here's where it gets weird: we had turned right into the semi-circle drive, after deciding we weren't going to explore we followed out the drive to the other side and turned right again back onto the side road away from the entrance we came in only to come over a small hill right back into the semi-circle drive again. Maybe it was a different part of the cemetery, but it certainly looked the same. It was almost 3am by that time and we were both a more than a little creeped out by then. We finally decided to go back out the way we came in and back to the main highway, which we somehow managed without a third trip through the cemetery and made it home not long after.

Now a little info on my friend John: he is one of the biggest skeptics about anything paranormal I have ever met. He tells me every time the topic comes up that a ghost would have to walk directly in front of him in order for him to believe and even then he said he would still be doubtful, but something about that cemetery must've scared him. The reason I say this is because even to this day, almost 15 years later, whenever I suggest maybe going back up there and checking it out again, he adamantly refuses and never really gives a good reason as to why."
"Bruises After Dream","Tennessee","Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis","The night before last, I had a dream a guy was forcibly holding me down by my arms and I kept struggling to no avail. The next morning, of course I didn't suspect it to of been anything other than a dream, but when I looked at my arm below my wrist I noticed a bruise and when I pressed it just barely, it hurt. That sort of freaked me out and I looked at my other arm in literally the exact same place was another bruise. It's not as visible, but it definitely hurts just as much. The guy didn't particularly look strange at all. He just had short, blonde hair and seemed welcoming at first because I wasn't afraid until I randomly got shoved to the ground with him pinning my arms down.

So this isn't the first time I've woken up with weird bruises, but this is the first time I've dreamt of something like that and then woke up to find the bruises in the places that guy was holding.

I'm just wondering if it's possible for a spirit or entity to somehow enter my dreams and actually inflict marks on me through the dream. There's no way I accidentally did that the day before because I wasn't doing anything at all nor were the marks previously there. I got a sinking feeling when I noticed how they were in the same spot on both of my arms. I even recreated the dream and held my arm and it was definitely the thumbs.

I'd just like to hear if anyone knows if they indeed can enter dreams or if you've ever had any similar incident such as this where you've had a dream of getting attacked and then woke up to find bruises in the same spots.

I have photos of both of the bruises on my arms."
"I Don't Believe, He Does","Pennsylvania","Haunted Places","My boyfriend and I have been together for a little over a year, and we decided to move in together back in March. Things were fine at first, we get along well and have a good relationship. It was around mid April, maybe the 13th would be my best estimation, that my boyfriend (I'll call him H from now on) saw a ghost or shadow person. I'm not a believer at all, but I'm trying to meet him halfway and try to understand what's going on, or what he believes is going on. I'll start by giving you his account as he's described it to me.

 H woke up at around 7am on the morning in question, because he heard the door to our bedroom creaking. He didn't see anything at first, so he rolled back over to return to sleep. Then he heard the door creaking again, and this time he sat bolt upright. He saw a dark humanoid shape with no features in our doorway, it appeared to be smoky in consistency. He yelled and jumped up, at which point the figure darted out of our doorway. H chased it out into the main room (we have a one bedroom apartment) but found nothing. Our front door was locked, so were all the windows, and he was confused and freaked out. By this point I was awake too, but I'll get into my side of this story in a moment. 

 H has seen this shadow person several times in the last month and a half. The next time was during the day, and I was out. H saw the same smoky humanoid figure in the bathroom mirror while he was shaving. Then about two weeks ago he saw the same entity through our window from the outside. Again, when H got in the door was locked and I was not home. Since then he's felt a dark presence watching him whenever he's alone. He also says he hears strange knockings against our bedroom walls and scraping sounds at night. 

 H thinks that this activity is tied to my interest in horror movies, and certain music. I do in fact have quite a collection of signed posters and memorabilia pertaining to these interests. H thinks that if I get rid of all my memorabilia that involves horror movies or rock/metal, that the activity he is experiencing will stop.

 Now, here's my side of the story. I know that H jumped out of bed that first morning and chased after something that he genuinely believes was there. I heard and saw exactly nothing, but I listened to him. We had a very honest conversation about whether he was really ready to move in together. I told him he could keep his place and we could still be together, I made sure he knew that our relationship doesn't hinge on living together. He swears that isn't a factor, and I have no reason to think he's lying. He knew about my interests long before he moved in, and he used to sleep over pretty regularly, and my posters and collectables never bothered him then. Or maybe they did and he didn't realize how much? I don't know, but H always actively supported my interests before he moved in. 

 I believe that it is genuinely disturbing to him now, but I don't want to give up my records and posters and favorite movies. I've made room for his decorations etc. I'm not trying to be a jerky know-it-all, but H has some severe anxiety issues. He takes meds for this, and they mostly seem to work for him. I tend to think this dark presence watching H could be a product of anxiety though. He's starting online college and a new part time job next week, and he's told me that it's very stressful for him. 

 As for the noises at night, we have a bird and five Guinea pigs in the main room, and our neighbors have kids; I hear them pretty frequently through the walls. As for the shadow figure, I have never seen anything like that and I've lived in this apartment alone for a year before H moved in. Maybe I'm not sensitive to these things, but I've never seen or heard anything here that I couldn't explain or that frightened me. Whatever H is experiencing, I don't think it has any connection to the stuff I'm into. I don't want to discount what he's telling me though; I just want to figure out what's going on and I have no idea how to approach this. Any insight or advice that anyone could provide me would be most welcome and appreciated. I've been researching various paranormal sites, and the people here seem pretty knowledgeable and willing to help."
"A Vist By Three","Florida","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","This happened when I was 12 years old in Saint Petersburg Florida. My Father was over seas at the time so my Mother decided that we would all stay with her mother for a while. So she packed up us five kids and we went to live our Grandmother. The time with our Grandmother was not always an easy one. Her house was big, and I loved that about it. But some of the places in her house were spooky and gave me an uneasy feeling. Like the small closet in the pantry room. I hated that room the most and avoided it when ever possible. 

The stairs were the next place, always made the hair on the back my neck stand up when I went down them. The feeling remained until you were standing on that last step. I always turned looking up the staircase expecting to see someone. But never saw anything at all. 

My Grandmother's room was the last place. It always made me feel ill at ease. Maybe because it was small and so cluttered. I was never sure why. I noticed none of my other siblings had any trouble in these areas of the house. Likewise for my Mother. To them it was just an old house. 

One day as we were getting ready to eat dinner my Mother asked to me to go wake up my Grandmother. I didn't move, I was unsure what to do.

""Naomi, go wake up your grandmother. Tell her dinner's ready."" she said

I went down the hall to her bedroom door. I really didn't want to go in. I watched her sleeping in bed and knew that I would have to go in to wake her up. I didn't even make it to her bed before I saw them. 

On the wall above my Grandmother's bed were three faces. They were old ladies looking down at my Grandmother. All of them looked right at me and smiled, then they were gone. Stunned I went and told my Mother what I saw. She went to wake up my grandmother, when she came out she said there was nothing there.

I felt so alone and was greatful when we moved into our own place three month later."
"Shape-shifter","California","Haunted Places","I'm not too sure what to name this experience, so I went ahead and chose shape shifter and you will see why as I continue my story.

 I was riding my bike really late at night, on my way to my girlfriend's house for some late night fun. I had just left my house and was about 1 minute away from it when I saw a young woman dressed in all black walking up a small hill I was about to ride down on. I was about 2 blocks away from her and I have 20/20 vision so I knew what I was looking at. In my head I was wondering why she was walking outside alone so late at night, but I really didn't think anything of it. Once I was about 1 block away from her and getting closer fast, I looked at her because I felt her staring at me. When I looked, she was no longer a young woman but an old woman also dressed in black, but the worst part was that she had a huge smile that was from ear to ear, white and bright, and she kept her eyes on me as I rode past her. As soon as I saw that smile, I felt something horrible in the pit of my stomach and I pedaled as fast as I could, but once I had passed her, the chain on my bike just locked and I almost lost control going down this hill. Had I not stopped with the soles of my shoes, I would have had a really bad fall.

 I picked up my bike and started running as fast as I could. This never happened again and I want to say it happened in the year 2011, but I would really like people's opinions on this. She didn't have sharp teeth, she just had an extremely large smile that was very unnatural and the feeling I felt told me that something bad was going to happen... 

The house that this happened in front of gives off this weird vibe, and one day me and my girlfriend were walking past it in broad daylight and she stepped on a piece of paper on the floor right in front of the house, and she slipped and hurt her knee... On above all things, a piece of paper. I feel it may be connected to the house but what I saw was more than just a ghost... If anyone has any information on what I may have witnessed I'd love to read it... Thanks

"Goodbye Through Free Falling","Indiana","Family / Friends Visits","A day before my birthday, my ex boyfriend from middle school/high school passed away suddenly. He was murdered for reasons we still don't know, or at least the media doesn't. (The murderer has been arrested). When I found out, I was shaken but not completely surprised as I heard he had gotten into drugs. 

Anyway, a couple days later, I spoke with my meditation class leader who is very in tune with spirits, energies, etc. I told her about how I felt we had tons of unfinished business and things left unsaid. He was always the type to pop back into my life unexpectedly every other year or so. He had even just added me as a friend again on Facebook. As I was telling her about my grief on losing him and about spirits, I heard an odd noise coming from the ceiling, but I dismissed it. Then, I heard a heavy ""thud"" sound come from the next room (her house is very small and it was just us). I felt the floor vibrate. I asked her, ""Okay, you heard that, right?"" I sensed it was a man who had come in the front door. She said no. I began to feel very ""heavy"" like someone was with us. (I've felt energies before). 

She asked me if I felt like my ex was with us. I said I didn't know but I felt that way- she then began to feel heavy and got goosebumps and said she thought it was him. We acknowledged it may or may not be him, but she told me to speak to it as though it was and to tell him to go to the light with God. This didn't last long and soon the heaviness feeling passed. She told me to stay aware as his spirit may still have a lot of unfinished business. I was skeptical but a little creeped out.

Right after, I went to our tiny pharmacy to pick up my birth control pills. I felt drained and very out of it, however the song ""Free Falling"" was playing in the background. It was an acoustic cover that seemed to repeat ""free falling"" over and over. Normally I don't take notice of songs but there was something that drew me to it. It felt eerie yet calming... I later looked up the lyrics since I never heard the song before, and to my surprise, it fit incredibly well with the situation with my ex boyfriend. What gave me chills was the last verse that he's going to ""leave this world for awhile.""

Again, I felt eerie but I still wasn't ""sold"" that it was him since I can be skeptical. The next morning, I told my coworker who is very open minded on this subject. When I was explaining it to her, I started feeling heavy again and tiny tapping noises started to come from her office window. At one point, she left the room and I said, "" (Ex's name) you'll have to do better than that to get my attention.""

Well, that moment came that afternoon. My coworker friend came back from lunch and ran after me to get my attention. She had met up with someone for lunch that coincidentally knew my husband. As they made that connection, my friend started talking about me - and as soon as she said my name a few times, ""Free Falling"" started playing on the radio.

I was shocked. To this day, I can't say with certainty that it was him but I feel completely satisfied with this conclusion. I no longer feel as though we have unfinished business... I feel at peace and I believe that if it was him, he is as well.

What are your thoughts? Thank you for reading."
"My Grandmother's Ghosts","Ohio","Haunted Places","My grandmother's house had quite a few spirits that hung around, most of which were benevolent.

 I was a very sensitive and easily frightened child and so my mother had built a psychic wall for my mind against spiritual manifestations. I don't remember any of the direct encounters I've had with ghosts because of that, although I know I had them. 

 There was a room in my grandmother's house that nobody liked. They were afraid of the entity that lived in the closet. My mom, stepfather, older sister and I lived there when I was about two. My sister and I stayed in that room. She hated it but I practically lived in that closet. My mother told me many times she'd realise she didn't know where I was and would find me in that closet talking to 'myself'. I don't remember these instances but I've never minded that room like everyone else. 

 We moved to the house next door after a year or so, I think. I had many indirect sightings of spirits in my grandma's home growing up. There was a young girl on her stairs I caught in my peripheral vision and a shadow man upstairs who seemed to get a kick out of scaring babies that learned to climb steps. 

 The most direct encounter I had after the psychic wall was when I moved in with my grandmother during my mom and stepfather's divorce. I was 17, staying in room with the closet entity. I felt it's presence often but it was friendly to me and so we coexisted. I was alone in the house and taking a bath when I heard the front door open and close hard (my grandma's door was solid heavy wood and you couldn't mistake the sound), then thundering foot steps up the stairs. All the way to the top, just outside the bathroom door. I was frozen in fear, I knew my whole family's foot steps by sound and it was not one of them. It was not my boyfriend either, who would come over frequently and also stay nights. 

 I waited for a several minutes before gathering my courage to go check. Wrapped in a towel I search the upstairs, and then the downstairs. Empty. I went to the front door, the deadbolt was locked. I asked my grandmother, mother, sisters, aunts and no one had ever had a similar experience in that house. 

 Not an immensely significant or intense encounter, but it's mine. Thank you for reading."
"I Was Young And Dumb And Casted A Spell","Texas","Misc","I was a teenager deeply ""in love"" and I had a boyfriend at the time who was long distance and promised me many things. He was not very communicative and always held a lot of what he felt or had to say inside. We spoke often and we talked about a future together and it was looking good so far.

 Well me being young and naïve I wanted him to be the one but I also wanted him to be more open and tell me all his secrets and feelings. I told him I was going to go visit him and he talked about other ""things"" that I was not ready for. But I was willing to take all risk just for him. 

Well when I noticed he wasn't being very communicative and all he wanted to talk about was XXX it really got me thinking. He did always tell me that he loved me and all and he showed me a ring that he was going to give me, but at that time I needed assurance. 

Thinking of way for him to be more open and honest I took it upon my self to find a solution. 

Just to clarify I have never casted a spell before that and this was my first time. I got the idea because my mom is clairvoyant and a bit psychic at times. She doesn't want to develop her gift. She often helps others and I see her lighting candles and right now she is helping my sister with her boyfriend and so everything she did just gave me ideas.

She is not a witch or doesn't do black magic she just uses candles prayers and herbs/oils.

Anyway for the past days I was being fed up that I was the one putting more effort into our relationship and I wanted and needed him to be more open and honest with me. I wanted he him to feel the same way as I felt. 

So I took it upon myself to google some love spells and not sure the name but something similar to obedient spells not quite though.

So that evening I went to a shed/ cabin I own and I followed the instructions. I bought red pink and white candles, I had a bowl with some special oils I can't remember, I had printed his pictures and I had the spell verse ready to go. 

So I had to put his picture in the oil with both our names and while lighting the candle I had say the spell out loud followed by ""MOTE IT BE"".

I also tried a few other enchanting spells and did other things to his pictures. In my mind at that age I thought I was awesome for doing this and I really made myself believe it was going to work.

Well darkness was approaching and I was headed home and I started to feel uneasy. I even told my mom that I was feeling a bit scared and I was honest I told her I casted a spell but I never told her what kind. 

So that was that and I went to my room and she went to hers.

Until minutes later I hear an owl - except this really was no owl.

To start with I am Hispanic. For those of you who may not know we often believe that witches can turn into owls or how we say ""Lechuzas"" they look like owls but with other different features.

Well we hear the loud bird just saying ""grrrr blahhh diiii daaaa"" A whole bunch of gibberish and it was very loud and it wouldn't shut up. My mom came to my room running and asked if I heard that. I confirmed that I did.

We were standing in our living room and there is a hallway in the living room that leads to two bed rooms. While I was standing there I happen to look where the hallway was. My mom was looking the opposite direction.

Well what I saw next really creeped me out, I saw an orange light from the hallways and there was a doorway where a shadow of a woman was walking out from. All of this was in an orange silhouette similar to the logo you see on the top of this page. 

At that moment I was so afraid that I yelled and I gave my mom a huge hug and I told her it was all my fault for casting a spell. And I had told her what I'd seen she almost did not believe me.

The minute I said I was sorry there was no sign of the orange light or shadow woman. On another note the ""lechuza"" was still being loud and rowdy. My mom went outside and yelled at it in Spanish. ""What the heck did it want and it had no business here""

She soon got back in the house and closed the door and ran to her room. 

I promise this thing was so loud and it was as if it were trying to speak and it was never quite. I walk to my mom's room and I see her go for a bag where she grabs a prayer card she has. She asked me to close the door and starts reciting this prayer but backwards, she really did shock me with this one. 

Shortly after repeating this a few times over and over the ""lechuza"" was gone. Everything was silent and back to normal. 

I must say I really did learn my lesson about trying cast a spell, especially when it was not done in a serious note. 

I know now to take these things seriously and with a cautious matter. 

From time to time I do like to read spells but never out loud and I have yet to try and cast another."

This is one is more recent. This week actually. I am rather intuitive and a complete believer that there are spirits and things out there in the world that can not be explained. My boyfriend is much more logical and grounded in facts and science- a skeptic, if you will. 

The other night, we were sitting on our couch, when he suddenly stopped mid-sentence and looked past me. He's played jokes on me before when he'll do double takes or pretend that he sees someone or something. I thought this was no different, but I turned my head and looked where he looked. Nothing was there- just the landing and entry way to our apartment. I thought, oh good one, he got me again, but when I looked back at him, he was still focused on the landing, very serious. He got up and walked slowly over to the landing, looked into the hallway (which has two closets on the left hand side, perpendicular to the front door). He then went into the kitchen and looked around before coming out and asking if I ""saw that"". At this point, I knew he wasn't joking and I said, no, what? And he said that he had seen a distinct shadow of a person, like someone had come into the apartment and was on the landing. He showed me where he saw the shadow and tried standing in different areas to see if he could cast a similar shadow for me to see. When he stood in front of the closet closest to the entry, I could not see him, but I could see his shadow where he had. 

He rejoined me on the couch and said that he really thought someone had come in. But our door was deadbolted so no one could have entered. Instinctually, I called out and said, Is anyone there? If you are and you're not meant to be, go towards the light. Maybe the strangest thing was that my skeptic boyfriend did not tease me for saying that, like he thought it was a good thing for me to say.

Later that night he brought it up again and said that maybe the reason our cat sits in that entry way a lot is to protect us from whatever that was.

I'm kind of bummed that I missed it and have never seen anything like it in this apartment, but it does make me wonder. 

Interestingly, that closet (that he was standing in front of when he replicated the shadow) has always had a reeeeeally distinct, strong smell. Like that old building-mothball-almost-nauseating-sweet-smell-mixed-with-cigarettes. And to be clear, it is NOT like the smell of an animal that has died and gotten trapped. I know that smell, so its not a dead mouse or anything. This is something different. We've been in this place 9 months and we always said it was left over old lady smell from the previous tenants. Or the person below us. Or in the apartment next to us. The whole apartment kind of smells stale from time to time (the building was built in the 1930s), but its most intense in that closet. And even though the rest of the apartment is fine most of the time, it is consistently in that closet. I can't get rid of the smell. I've tried airing it out with fans, air fresheners, charcoal, vinegar, nothing works. 

Is it possible that that smell is somehow linked the shadow that my boyfriend saw? Any one have experiences with lingering smells? Is it possible it is linked to something supernatural, if physical remedies aren't working?"
"I Bought A Haunted House","California","Haunted Places","We just bought a house at the end of March and we have been having some odd things happening. A couple days after we moved in my kids windows were open the next morning after we know we shut them before bed. The screens were still in place and the back gate leading to their windows was still latched.

My middle son who is 14 started hearing noises in hall at night. A little girl counting, she counted to eight and stopped and someone walking in the hall.

I have a pocket door for my bathroom in my room, I went in my room to use the bathroom to my knowledge no one was home. My husband had left for work early that morning, my oldest was at a friends and I had just gotten back from taking the other two to school. The door was shut and I could see the light was on from the cracks. I tried to slide it open but it was locked, I knocked and asked if someone was in there, no response. Then I panicked a little thinking my older son had come home and something happened like he slipped and hit his head. I called his name, no response. So I went to get a flat object to turn the lock. I opened the door and nobody was there. This experience bothered me because I used the bathroom right before I went out the door and I know I didn't shut the door and I definitely did not lock it from the outside.

The next experience was getting up for work, 4:45am, my bedroom door is straight down from my youngest son's room, and I could see this black foggy mass passing in front of his toy drawers. It's one of those rubbermaid plastic drawers you get from walmart. It was about three feet in height and no form at all, and it moved super slow. I just stood there and watched it go through and it either disappeared as it went into the wall or it went through to the other room. I look for it all the time now but haven't seen it since.

The next event I am having a lot of trouble wrapping my brain around. I was laying on my bed paying Bills, I had my phone, the bills, and a pen. I was on the phone with the automated system and realized I needed the checkbook. The checkbook was in the file cabinet on the other side of the room. I got up off the bed with only my phone in my hand and walked across the room. I was almost to the cabinet when the pen that I left on the bed hit me in the back of the head. I turned and looked at the pen that had fallen at my feet and asked out loud, ""Did you just hit me with a pen? That's not cool!"" I measured it, the pen flew about 12 to 13 feet. It didn't hurt but it was a solid hit. I don't understand this at all, it boggles my mind!

The next thing may be a live human person. I was making my coffee in the kitchen at 5am. I use only the light under the microwave because the main kitchen light is too bright before coffee. Coffee is done and I am shaking my creamer bottle and I look out the kitchen window to see a man in my driveway a few feet away looking at me. I couldn't make out facial features but it was still dark, he was very small and kind of felt more like 12 year old size and all in black. We both stood there for a few seconds staring at each other, he didn't move a muscle. Then I decided I should catch him. I bolted for the door coffee creamer still in hand and ran out, nothing nowhere, not a sound of running feet either. I told my husband about the man and we decided to get a ring doorbell for a little more security. I am going to assume he was not a ghost because it's the live ones you really have to watch out for, but there is something about the encounter that just doesn't feel right, I don't know if it was the way he looked, his size, I'm just not sure.

The last event my son told me about this morning. He was laying in bed last night, and his closet door which was open about two feet closed. It is the type that slide. He told me, on a previous occasion it opened and then closed about the same distance. I checked the doors and they don't slide super easy so I don't believe it to be gravity, wind currents, or anything like that, I had to use some pressure to make them move.

So we have lived here about a month and a half and I am wondering what's going on, we did have a little girls disembodied voice at the other house, she said hello and mom to me, but I don't know if it's the same girl that was counting, and maybe she followed us. I don't feel threatened at all, but I would like to know who is here."
"Bite Marks On My Daughter's Arm","Oregon","Misc","I am a mother of a 13 year old daughter. Every night for about 8 days now she wakes up at 5:18 am crying. 

Last night she woke up shaking and crying. She said her arm hurt, she was nauseous and dizzy. Upon inspection of her arm there were 3 clearly defined bite marks. The teeth marks were on her left lower arm and was very red spread across her forearm. Yes, I did look to make sure it wasn't her teeth impression. 

I instantly started to pray. The more I prayed I could hear the growling and hissing get louder and louder. My protectiveness of my daughter kicked in and I continued to pray until the growling and hissing stopped. It took about half an hour. This morning my daughter was still shaken by her experience.

I did ignite some dry sage and smudged the house. As I was smudging the smoke would go mainly were I aimed it. There was one spot where the smoke would tornado or swirl in circles. I kept trying to smudge that area. The smoke always kept going towards me instead. 

I figured that was where the area of concern was. I was persistent and redid the room to ensure it was gone. I left the sage burning in her room and closed the door. 

Maybe, thinking now I should have left the door open. But, afterwards, I went back into her room and saw a projection of her laying in her bed. I have seen her projection before while she was sleeping but never before while she was awake.

I'm unclear what this means. I'm unsure of what else to do. 

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated."
"What Does She Want With Me?","California","Haunted Places","My name is Elijah.

I live in a house with two other roommates whom I consider to be like family.

Ever since I could remember, I've been able to feel shadows. The figures that follow you, whether good or evil, I could sense them so intensely that I could describe how they look, without actually being able to see their features. All I need is to feel their energy and I feel like I know them.

Its been almost a week now and I continue to wake up every morning at 3:40 am, parched and in desperate need of water. When I get up to go to the kitchen, that's when I see her. A short shadow by my fridge that in the first few days was very shy. I could tell that she was young, no older than 10 years old. I could feel that she was good, yet every morning without fail, she stood there by the fridge, almost like she was trying to tell me something.

I never mentioned this to either of my roommates in fear they'd think I was going crazy, but one morning at the usual 3:40, I woke up but didn't get out of bed. This time the ghost child started to mess with me: tapping on my headboard, opening and closing doors, anything to get my attention. This time I was too tired to get up so I continued ignoring her.

Later that morning, I was sitting in the living room reading and drinking coffee, when my roommate came in and sat right next to me.

""You will not believe what happened this morning!"" she said excitedly.

""What!"" I try matching her enthusiasm while still keeping my eyes on my book.

""Well, I stayed up late last night, watching my show, and I kind of fell asleep on the couch. Around like 3:30, something woke me up and when I looked in the hallway, I kid you not, there was a little girl by your door. She had pigtails! And a night gown that moved like there was a breeze in the house!"" She gradually got more excited as she spoke.

I looked at her, surprised that she had described the ghost child I'd been feeling around me for the past week.

""I thought I was dreaming so I just covered my face to try and go back to sleep, but when I looked again she was still there and was motioning me to your room, the door was open now though. I shook my head at her and prayed because only Jesus can make that sort of stuff go away.""

I rolled my eyes at the Jesus remark and laughed, but that confirmation was crazy to hear.

Every-time I go into the garage I feel another presence, this isn't the little girl. This one is dark, negative, mean, and angry. It feels like a tall man, very aggressive, and he scares me. Eventually, I convinced myself that if I didn't pay attention to him, then he would leave me alone. That didn't happen. Now, every time I walk into the garage and ignore him, I get a chill over my entire body.

Which kind of makes me wonder. If I was right about the little girl, then..."
"Sleeping Terror","Ohio","Haunted Places","This took place when I was a child, living with my grandparents home was also with my mother and uncle all under one roof. 

Now mind you, when I was a kid I was used to the feelings and seeing of entities as long as they were nice. Most where thankfully kind and understanding.

When I was young I was afraid of the dark and when it was my bed time I would turn on my christmas lights, which used to be on my bedpost just so I can sleep. It was pretty nice and I always loved it, making it easier to rest and sleep; however, one night in particular was frightening. 

On that night I was being bad and my mother decided to punish me by taking the lights away. I was terrified and was crying, pleading for my mother to not take the lights. No matter what I said she wouldn't listen and put them in her room. Now I was a young, crying child in the pitch black, darkness that was the night in my room alone and afraid. I looked on in fear in the dark void that was my room now and suddenly felt an overwhelming tiredness over me out of nowhere. I tried to fight it, but with no prevail and soon past out in a deep sleep.

Unknowingly, when I fallen asleep, I woken up in my astral state. This particularly astral projection was like what you see in the insidious movie. The room was my room, but a dark version of it. I was facing the wall that my bed was against and instantly felt something behind me, breathing on me. I was breathing heavily and was terrified, but something awoken in me. I was tired of being afraid of the dark and built up the courage to turn around and let out an angry yell. As I did, I could hear a man yelling back. It was deep and almost an echo. Only a second past before I bolted awake. I was shaken and looked around in my room to only find nothing.

Ever since that night I was never afraid of the dark and slept without my christmas lights.

I always thought of that experience and how so real it was to me. It wasn't until years later that I found out a man killed himself in our gurage. 

Could it have been that man? Could it be my dead family members? Could it have been just a wild kid's imagination affecting their dreams?

I don't and probably will never know. Tell me what you guys think and let me know if you had any similar experiences."
"Three Generations Of A Haunting","Tennessee","Haunted Places","I'm not sure where to even start, really. My story is really my family's story, starting with my great-grandparents and ending when my mother, stepfather, and I moved out of the house where everything happened. I suppose the best place to start, is with the beginning, some time in the 40's. 

My great-grandfather was originally from TN, as was my great-grandmother, but he was in the navy during WWII and was stationed at several different posts. Chicago, Hawaii, and if I recall correctly a short stint in California. It wasn't until he was released from service that he and my great-grandmother bought the house they raised us all in. I'll disclose their first names only, because I'm not terribly creative and they sound made up anyway. Etheredge and Opal were young, and they wanted a house with bedrooms for children, and a large yard.

What they found was a three bedroom home for a steal, with a back yard facing an alley and no garage or driveway. Opal was fine with that, up until she passed of old age in 2002 she'd never driven a day, but Ethredge was adamant they have a driveway. In the end, Opal won out and they put in a inground pool. The pool lasted all of six months, and any time it was brought up, Opal would get furious, and end the conversation. It was one of many things they never wanted spoken of. 

They were incredibly religious, Southern Baptists to the core, and they wanted it reflected in their home. Their bedroom had door into the hallway, but to insure that there was no undue temptation past the making of a child, Ethredge knocked out part of the bedroom wall, so it opened freely into the kitchen. I firmly believe this was what started my family's nightmare. Soon after the wall was removed, Opal gave birth to their only child, Ethredge Jr, forever known simply as Junior. 

Opal announced they would never have another child immediately, and Junior was given what was always referred to as the ""back bedroom"".The name made no sense to any of us, as it was next to the front door, but that's what it was, so no one fought Opal on it's name.

 When he was roughly a year old, Opal's sister, Polly, moved in with her husband. Here is where the family lore, as we call it, really gets going. There is a rather large split in the family, or there was, as a good deal of the people involved have since passed away, about what exactly happened to my Uncle, who's name I never learned.

He died in Opal and Etheredge's bedroom. Now, this was the late forties, no later than 47 if my math is right, so the police work was very open and shut. The coroner, and a good deal of the family, say he had a heart attack. Opal and Polly, who had been home with him at the time of his passing, vehemently denied this, going so far as to start at least one fist fight with a distant cousin.

 Opal, until her dying days, would say he drowned. She talked about him building a fire in the front bedroom, putting his head up to make sure the chimney wasn't blocked, and then coughing up what look like lake water. She insists they laid him down on her bed to get him out of the room, and by the time she had 911 on the phone, he'd drowned. Polly corroborated the story, saying he was fine, then choking on water like his head had been dunked. 

It was still ruled a heart attack. After his funeral, Polly moved out and never set foot in the house again. Ethredge boarded up the fireplaces, one in each bedroom, and then in a move he never explained to anyone, he painted over all three mirrors set in the mantle pieces. As a child, I remember vividly getting the snot knocked out of me for scratching the paint off. It was repainted that night, and we never spoke of it again. Painted mirrors, however, were not the only oddity of the house. After Junior grew up and moved out with his wife, my grandmother who never had much to do with the house, another bit of renovation took place. The two children's bedrooms were connected by a knocked out wall, in the same way that the master bedroom was opened to the living room. This made things escalate. 

In the 60's, Junior and his wife, my grandmother, went through a nasty divorce, and in the shuffle my mother and my aunt came to live with Opal and Ethredge. Rose was roughly six, and Mary was around ten, and they were assigned bedrooms, and asked to help Ethredge lower the ceiling. They found the rafters burned, as though there was an intense fire. After checking, they found there had been a house there that had burned down, but their home had never caught fire. Nonetheless, the attic was sealed off.

It took six months, roughly, for Rose and Mary to be woken up in the night. Knocking on the walls, cold air from the closets, something scratching in the fireplace, and perfume permeating the entire house when Opal never wore such things. The worst came in the form of dreams of some unseen thing at the end o the hallway. 

Rose had dreams, at least once a week, where she and two other children were in the back bedroom. They could run across the hallway and be safe in the master bedroom, but they had to be careful to stay unseen by the thing in the hallway. It wasn't until my adulthood that she discovered I had the same dream. We never discussed the house, or it's otherworldly inhabitants, so it shocked us both. 

The front door had to be replaced six times over the years, from slamming open, starting when Rose was thirteen. It would hit the wall so hard, the wood would crack. One day, while the girls were at school, at an unspecified time, every window in the house was nailed shut, the countersinks cut, and the seams painted over. No reason was ever given.

Things often vanished and reappeared in bizarre places, cabinets would refuse to stay closed, and the hallway would frighten visitors to the point oftentimes no one would be willing to venture further than the kitchen. By the time I was born, the family had accepted that whatever was happening in the house was simply never to be spoken of.

I lived in the house from the time I was born, in 1989. As a small child, I was utterly terrified of the small closet in the back bedroom, despite my bed resting against it. It always had a chilling breeze from under the door, and I could hear a creaking, slow noise from inside it most nights. Junior had remarried, and I had two aunts close to me in age, so we inevitably became close as children. 

The dream I later found I shared with Rose is one of my first memories. We were huddled, waiting to cross the hallway. He couldn't see us, but we had to be so, so careful. One girl crossed. Then a second. Then it was me. They assured me I was safe. He couldn't see me. And I started crossing. He DID see me, and every time I would wake screaming. The most frightening thing about the dream was the utter absence of anything at the other end of the hallway. Whatever we hid from, was completely unseen. 

During the day the house was always unwelcoming. The back bedroom was chilling, even in full daylight. The hallway would inexplicably play a radio station from Nashville in the fifties, always the same program. Faint, but present the most in the summer. The covered back porch held a special kind of menace that made me uneasy, and the screen door was often slamming late into the night, despite there being no wind. 

Opal died when I was nine. She passed quietly. At the time, I lived alone there with her and Ethridge, and after her passing, it was only the two of us. I took to sleeping on the couch. In the doorway to the hall from the living room, there was something that would stare at me. I never saw anything resembling a figure, but I knew, down to my bones, that there was something in that doorway, and it hated me.

I lived there with him until he passed when I was thirteen, my mother and stepfather having moved in when I was twelve to help me take care of my aging great-grandfather. After his funeral, we were gone in a month, never to return. So much more happened, things I'm unsure if I have the fortitude to talk about. Entities I did see with my own eyes, and even some things I found out about the lands history. 

I'm more than happy to answer questions, or give more specific details, I'm just trying to get the bulk of this out before I lose my nerve. I'm thirty this year, and I'm still deeply affected by that house."
"Tore Us Apart","California","Haunted Places","A few years ago, my oldest daughter was preparing to take her First Communion. The church required that parents and godparents attend a two day retreat.

It was during this retreat that my children's father reconnected with God. He was touched by everything he lived that day. I remember seeing him literally brought down to his knees in tears. After the retreat, he started going to Mass every Sunday with my Mom and children. He bought a Bible and signed up for bible study. He even asked me to marry him, he wanted a big Catholic wedding, suddenly he wanted everything blessed by God.

 It was right at that time that we started noticing some really scary things happening. Doors would slam on their own, we would feel watched and no matter what we did our house was always freezing cold, day and night. At night, we would hear someone whispering in our bedroom but never found where it was coming from. Our children started having nightmares and their attitude started changing, they weren't as happy anymore. I don't know if it was sleep deprivation, but it's like we were angry and tired all the time. My ex had trouble sleeping, he would complain that something kept waking him up. A couple of times I woke at night to see him peeking out the bedroom window. He said that ""he is here to take the children"", when I would ask him ""who?"", he would shush me and would whisper that he was going to hear us. The next day he would wake up like nothing happened and when I would ask him he would laugh and say it was nothing, that he must have been sleep walking. 

We were told by a member of our church congregation to set our Bible on our night stand and have it open on a psalm (don't remember which one). We started praying every night before bed. It worked for a little bit. We had a group of people come to our house and help us bless it, then we sat around and prayed and sang hymns and church songs. It was a very peaceful, spiritual night, for the first time in months, we felt safe and thought everything was going to be alright. That is until everyone left and we walked upstairs to our bedroom.

 We found the Bible on the floor, it appeared it had been thrown across the room. This scared me so much I refused to go in the bedroom and slept with my children in one bedroom. We had the priest come and bless the house the next day. That seemed to work for a while. 

Then we had our big Catholic wedding. As soon as we started with the planning and preparation, the fighting started and didn't stop, we actually fought on our way to church and during all of our 'honeymoon'. It was as if we suddenly hated each other. We went to couples counseling; we got help from the priest of our church and a few church members. Nothing seemed to help.

 I remember now that I would look at him and feel absolute hate. It started affecting our children to the point that they got counseling too. It was one of the worst times of our lives. There wasn't one night that one of the children didn't get up and go to our bedroom because they were scared, and would complain that knocking wouldn't let them sleep. We knew they were not making it up, we had heard the knocking too. My oldest slept holding her rosary beads one night, she was so scared, she fell asleep praying. The next morning, she came and asked me if I had taken her rosary beads because they were gone. We looked for them everywhere but we never found them. We tried just about everything to cleanse our home and get our family back but nothing seemed to work. We pretended we were a happy family for appearances, we literally would go to Mass every Sunday and wouldn't even look at each other during the service. 

We tried to stay together for as long as we could. We had never talked about separating, we both thought that what God brought together, no one would be able to tear apart. Then one day, without the yelling, without the crying, without the hate, we decided that we had had enough. So, after living together for 12 happy years and 3 miserable ones, he packed his things and left. That night, I slept better than I had in 3 years. After that day, my house felt lighter, was happier and guess what? Me and my 3 children slept through the night, no noise, no knocking, no blankets being pulled. The funny thing is that he says the same thing. He feels more at peace now, he's much happier and he doesn't feel angry any more. 

I still have the occasional unexplained occurrence, for as long as I can remember I have seen spirits. But, nothing like what I felt, heard and saw during this time in my life, that was different. I will always wonder what this was. It's as if something did not want us getting close to God. My children have all been baptized, they have had their first communions and confirmations, it's what's expected coming from a very devout Catholic family. I believe in God but I have to say that I am not a religious person. I never go to church or mass anymore, and now that my children are older I have let them choose if they want to go or not. 

Does anyone have any thoughts or theories of why this was happening to my family at precisely this time?"
"My Ongoing Story","North Carolina","A Haunted Life","It started when I was little. I can remember 6-7 year old. I use to chew gum and right before bedtime I'd chew my gum and watch whatever cartoon was on TV in my bedroom. My mom would tell me to throw my gum away and brush my teeth. I wouldn't throw it away (mind you I'm like 6 or 7) I'd put it at the back of my tv cabinet behind a picture frame. Yes it's gross but whatever. I'd brush my teeth and sit back in front of my tv until time to crawl in bed. Every single time I would do this my""abc"" gum would hit me in the face. I would throw it away after that. Never really scared. 

I remember walking down the driveway and smelling cherry cigars (my uncle was the only one who smoked them and he was dead before that happened.) 

At 12 years old.

I use to hear a lady calling my name down the hallway at my parents home whenever nobody was there. My parents would be out to dinner and I'm an only child so it was just me. Generally, I'd hear it call me 2 or 3 times. I'd never answer it. I just locked myself in the living room and learned to deal with it since it happened almost every night.

I would see a figure down the hallway could never tell if it was male or female but the episodes started happening more. I never felt threatened but at this time I started getting nervous. 

Flash forward to 18 years old.

I got married in a hurry mainly to get out of my parents house. We moved into an apartment in the middle of town. For a few weeks it was decent no episodes of any kind then I had my first miscarriage. I started seeing the same shadow as before. I brushed it off.

I got pregnant again this time everything was fine. We moved into a bigger rental property and things got way worse. I would hear arguing at night and sometimes in the middle of the day. My husband at the time worked 3rd. I was maybe 6 months pregnant and I saw this shadow again go down my hallway and into my room. This burning smell started and the smoke alarm went off. I looked around the kitchen and my room nothing was on fire the alarm went off and the smell was gone. I went back to my sofa and called my husband crying. He called me crazy and hung up. 

My daughter was born early, my BP was horrible, and I had preeclampsia. At this time she was maybe a few weeks old. I put her in my room for a nap in the playpen for some reason I couldn't stand her room and I refused to let her nap in there. It was dark and just unsettling. So I left the door open in my room so I could hear her. I heard the door shut and a bang. My husband was there he heard it too. We ran down the hallway my door was closed and wouldn't open. He shoved it open and being as he had to put some force into it, we saw her playpen slide across the room so her playpen was holding the door shut. I wanted to leave but he refused and said he don't know what happened and he didn't want to talk about it. 

Two years later we bought a house from an elderly woman's niece. Guys I really loved this house. It was built in 1949. The husband of the woman died in 92 in the driveway. The old woman died like a week or less after we bought the house. That's why they were rushing to sell. Didn't find out until later that the late husband had a sister that the niece move into the house to be closer to them, because she needed care. She died in my daughters room. Did not know this until a year later. I know they didn't have kids. I don't know why. 

In this time I got pregnant with my 2nd daughter. My husband and I fight all the time. It was a horrible marriage but I stuck it out. He became abusive and it just got worse. I can't explain it but during this pregnancy something changed the house got dark. My husband would leave me every other weekend to go camping with his friends. The basement was the worse place in the house like something is down there. I got sensitive to the house and everything else around me. Well I would hear a grown man footsteps upstairs when my husband was gone. I would actually go to my friend's house and just stay with her when he camped. I was terrified. 

This went on for months then my daughter was born. She was around 4 months old and my husband was camping that weekend so I sent my oldest to my parents to spend the night. I came in from supper that night Nola was asleep in the car seat so I set her in my room with the door open and I sat in the living room next to my room made sure there was nothing on to wake her and I played a game on my phone. About ten minutes after I sat down I heard her wake up and cry then I heard a grown man yell at her to shut up and she started screaming. I ran to her. Her car seat was turned around all of my drawers were open. I grab her and my dog got in the van something told me to look back at the house and in the window of my bedroom was a grown man. I called my mom crying and she called 911. I went to her house and my Dad went to mine he meet the two officers at the front door. All three of them did a walk through and even walked in the woods out back. One of the officers told my Dad no one has broke in but something is off. 

Flash forward to my 3rd daughter. By this time whatever it was didn't pick on me or my girls anymore instead it started in on my husband. Which was great. In the basement we were arguing one night and I saw the light above his head swinging I told him to watch out and down that sucker came busted all on the floor. Over his head it was great.

 Flash forward again we moved to the spare room upstairs for a change during this time all of my girls slept in our room out of fear. My husband woke me up in the middle of the night claiming that someone is in the walk in attic beside our bed knocking things down. I laughed at him and told him to go to sleep.

 Few nights before we moved upstairs the girls and I were asleep in the downstairs bedroom it's right next to the front porch he was outside smoking. Mind you this is like 3am. My husband ran in turned the lights on a started yelling at me. Claiming I was going up and down the stairs he could hear me stomping on the hardwood. It stopped when I woke up and hasn't bothered me since or my girls since. It's now his problem. He got mad and didn't sleep the rest of the night.

 Now flash forward again my oldest is 5 years old we were watching something on TV and she pointed out hearing something from the kitchen we look over and we both saw a woman walk from one side of the kitchen to the other I couldn't help but laugh I know I sound crazy but it's been years of this crap so it doesn't bother me anymore. I told my daughter not to be scared she is just watching out for us is all. Then we hear the front door unlock and she goes running to welcome her Daddy and nobody was there he didn't get home until an hour later. There has been so many more episodes since, that I could write a book about it. But we have since divorced and sold our house. 

I'm happily engaged and the episodes have followed me to our new home but doesn't bother us like before. It's odd I know. It's my life I really know nothing else. I showed my parents pictures and videos at my old house and they 100% believe me now. They just don't know that I have been having these issues long before the house and still having them. My fiance understands and accepts. Thank God. I'd like to figure out what is happening with me and fix it but at this point I think nothing would help. I'm not a religious person and I don't find comfort in it like others do. Seems everything that could help is centered around religion."
"The Rabbit In The Back Seat","Texas","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","Someone had shared an Easter bunny experience on this sight, an it reminded me of an experience my son had. He's not the only one. 

My son was in his teens. He was very troubled as he had just lost a brother to suicide and mom,me, lost her mind. 

He had left home and I spent a great deal of time in search of him. I would bring him home only for him to leave again. 

While on his own, it was a non-stop party. Those were scary days. He would call me some times terrified. He had done too much of a drug and I would talk him down. He would tell me he loved me, but wouldn't come home. 

I digress. He and his best friend often attended raves. Of which my generation ushered in and out children are dying in. 

Anyway, at one of these raves, he noticed a man with a black rabbit head. He thought he was just tripping and continued his activities. 

Thru the night he noticed the rabbit seemed to be every where he was and seemed to just stand motionless watching him. It unnerved him but he still thought it a hallucination. 

The two boys met a couple of really nice guys that asked for a ride home that night. If you have not been to rave, this would be pretty common. The ecstasy makes people very friendly. You have a sense of unity and connecting. It would be very beautiful if it wasn't induced by a dangerous drug. 

My son noticed the rabbit seemed to be with the 2 men. So he thought maybe he wasn't hallucinating after all. 

Their guests sat in the back seat with the rabbit being sandwiched by the 2 men. 

My son drove. He got a really bad feeling. He would glance up and that rabbit would be staring back with black eyes. Not eyes of a mask but living eyes. 

They chatted with the 2 men all the way to their destination. 

When they arrived to drop the men off, they turned to say good bye and no one was in the back seat. No one ever got out of the vehicle. The men were gone and the rabbit. Just vanished into thin air. 

The 2 boys compared notes trying to make sense of what just happened. 

They both agreed that there were 2 men, they both had the same description and name for the men. They confirmed the discussions they were having with the men was the same. 

They were dumb founded. They didn't feel anything negative from the men they also agreed. They seemed almost protective. 

As they drove home my son's best friend says, "" I don't know if they were ghost or angels, but they were cool. It was that damn rabbit with them that scared the piss out of me. That's why I would not turn to talk to them because that rabbit was staring back at me.!"" He laughed and continued ""I'm just hallucinating that part tho right?""

My son confirmed he too saw it. Their descriptions matched and they both noticed it at the rave. 

They agreed that the rabbit was something very bad and had bad intentions. They agreed it is pretty far fetched they had the same hallucination with so many variables. The men appeared at the end of the night. They believe the men asked for the ride to protect them from whatever it is they saw.

There are other reports that are not all drug induced of seeing this thing and all say it's bad. He is even reported to be a glitch seen in certain games. He isn't supposed to be there. He is not part of the program but yet there he is. I've seen him myself in a game with my kids. It was very eerie to say the least."
"Shadow Person Looked Like Girlfriend","Pennsylvania","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I was preparing dinner tonight, before my girlfriend came to my place. In the corner of my eyes I saw her walk from my dining room down to my bathroom. As this figure who I thought was my girlfriend pass me I said hello. She turned or it did and looked at me and walked by. After a minute I went back to check on what I assumed was my girlfriend and there was no one in my room or bathroom. 

When I got to my son's room there was an extremely cold draft passing through me so I stopped and decided to turn around and go back to cooking dinner. I was so bewildered I wanted to leave my dinner and everything just to get out of my apartment and not go back in. To make matters worse as soon as I walked into the kitchen my girlfriend texted me and said she would be 15 minutes late.

This is not the first time I saw a shadow person or ghost here. I'm just concerned now because it's the first time it decided to take a human form. Should I be concerned? I'm going to sage my apartment tomorrow, is there anything else I should do to this apartment? My concern is whatever this is trying to make contact with my son. He is 9 years old and is on the spectrum.

 He is entirely too trusting when it comes to anything and he told me about the old lady in the apartment he sees. Which I believe is my girlfriend's grandmother. Which is weird since she lived in Alabama and I never met her or saw a picture of her. After I described the old lady ghost to my girlfriend she said she saw her grandmother here also. I'm lost on what to do please help."
"My Room With The Woman","California","Haunted Places","As a kid in I grew up in two houses. One was with my mom and the other was with my dad. I always felt more at home with my dad because my mom's house had a bad energy. But while at my dads we had a spirit in our house and we called him The Little Guy. TLG was harmless but he would always catch someone off guard and it would scare them. So my step mom asked him to leave and he did, that was about 10 years ago. Now there is something evil in my house but it isn't just running around like TLG. It is out to harm me and so far it's done a pretty good job. 

When I am in my room I get terrible nightmares that feel so real I try to force myself awake. I will wake up and it feels like someone has been strangling me. Now more recently I have been getting cuts on my face and neck. They aren't scratches they are cuts. It is as if someone took a razor blade and lightly ran it across my skin. Whatever it is it only wants me. 

I sleep downstairs in the game room in order to get a good night sleep. It is the only place it can't seem to get in order to harm me. I have burned sage in my room 3 times the past month and in total probably 20 times. It comes back usually the next day, from what I can gather it is a woman and she is evil wanting to harm me. The way I was able to find this out was the cliché Ouija Board. There were 3 main spirits, one left immediately when spoken to, one was good, the other is evil. The good one was named Henry and after we talked to him he was pushed out, now we have the woman. I don't remember what she called herself but I know she wants me harmed.

 This is an ongoing issue so I will hopefully be able to keep this site updated on any changes that may happen. Also as a warning don't look at the corners of your room in mirrors they find ways to get to you when you do."
"Unexplained Phenomenons","Missouri","Haunted Places","My husband and I moved into the apartment we currently reside in a little over two years ago. It's quite spacious and has updated amenities. There is a master bedroom with a full bath attached and a guest bedroom with a restroom just outside of it. We live on the top floor of a 3-story apartment building and have only one neighbor with whom we share a wall with that is seldom noisy. With that being said, there have been a few instances where I've questioned what I saw and heard.

 The first few months that we lived here, I'd notice that the hall light outside of the both the bedrooms would be on in the morning two to three times a week. At first, I thought surely it was one of us leaving it on at night and forgetting that we had. Then, after several occurrences and both my husband and I denying they we left it on to each other, I decided to verbally acknowledge that I was turning it off. I looked at my husband before we went into the master bedroom that night and said, ""Ok, this is me turning off the light, so we know for certain that it should be off in the morning."" I said it jokingly but part of me was serious and needed an explanation. 

 There would be no reason for him and or I to venture out at night because there's a bathroom in the master bedroom and we always came to bed with full bottles of water. You can imagine my surprise in the morning when I came out (while my husband still slept) and found the light on yet again, the switch turned up and all. This made my hair stand on end. However, as time went on, the light being on in the hallway lessened and has finally stopped about six months ago. 

 I've tried to come up with an explanation for it, and the only thing I can think of is that I may be sleep walking, which is something I used to do up until about five years ago. I don't think this is as likely though because my husband says he hasn't seen me do it since then, and he always used to catch me doing it (from what he tells me as I of course have no memory of it, haha!) 

 The next instance happened about a year ago in the master bedroom. I was asleep and was woken abruptly by a soft sound (a thud or a pop). The south side of the bedroom has a door that leads to the balcony and always has a bit of light shining through its blind due to the street lights in the parking lot below. As I woke, I turned my head towards the door and saw what looked to be the silhouette of a person standing about a foot in front of it. There were no features, but I could tell by its shoulders and torso that the figure was male (perhaps about 5'7"") and it was wearing a hat. Our bed sits opposite the door, so the figure was turned directly towards us about seven feet from the end of the bed. I was so startled that I jolted out of bed and turned on the light for the entire room (my husband was confused and I didn't explain until morning to him what I had seen). Of course, there was nothing there. 

 My heart would not stop pounding for about 30 minutes after the incident. I tried rationalizing what I saw as a dream leaked over into reality (if you know what I mean). I had a similar instance happen to me when I was about 14 and saw a figure directly next to my bed standing and looking down. It was so close to my bedside lamp that I thought my eyes had plaid a trick on me, but at the time, it felt so real. That figure also vanished as soon as I turned on the light.

 The final and most significant thing happened to me last night, leading to me writing down all of these occurrences. I was laying on my side of the bed (right side) which has a nightstand and a lamp directly next to it. If you were to lay on your side facing out, you'd be facing a window that let\'s a little light in much like the patio door. I fell asleep at about 11:30 PM and woke facing the outside exactly 45 minutes later (I checked the clock). I don't know why I woke up, but I immediately noticed something on my nightstand. It was roughly the size of a bird, and that was what my brain made it to be. It was completely black and sitting about a foot from my face. I then saw it move to the left, much like a movement of a bird walking (with a little sway). I was so frightened I yet again jumped out of bed and turned on the light fully expecting there to be a creature on my nightstand. As you can guess, there was nothing when I looked. 

 I checked high and low (no sign of anything, and there had been no noise) and told my husband what I saw. He thought it might have been the dream leaking into reality again, but to me it was so vivid that I was nearly positive there was an animal in the room. I was so exhausted that I wasn't even afraid to turn the light off and attempt to go back to sleep.

 Here is the odd part. Almost instantly after turning off the light, a memory of my grandfather came into my mind. I could see and hear him so clearly as I lay there trying to fall back asleep, and the thought of him and his voice eventually led me to drift off. He passed away a little over four years ago. There was no reason for me to be thinking of him and I did not even question it until the morning. Was it him that I saw, a ghost, a dream, or something else?

 Side notes: I sometimes find our closet light on and hear thuds in the space above our apartment (all minor things). 

 With all these stories being shared, I'd love to hear your opinions on them. I'm not the type of person to say paranormal experiences are untrue, but I also try to be rational and come up with explanations for the unexplained. Any thoughts would be appreciated. Thanks for reading, and I'll update if anything else happens!"
"It All Started With A Possessed Table","Indiana","Haunted Items","When I was in 6th grade (so like 12 years old), I was invited by one of the popular girls to her slumber party for her birthday, and I was very excited to go because it was my first year at a private Catholic school and I was still trying to make friends. Everyone was looking forward to one girl coming in particular (she'd switched schools so I'd never met her before) because she was bringing her special table to the party. They said this table could answer your questions, but I've always been skeptical by nature and so I was doubtful but I just rolled with it.

The night of the party, this girl we'll call April arrived with her table. It wasn't anything spectacular, just an old fold up square card table that had belonged to her grandma. It had a vinyl covering on the top that had a wood grain pattern, with a large diamond shape in a different pattern of wood grain, and yet another wood grain pattern inside of that. After the usual eating of pizza and watching of movies, we went upstairs to the birthday girl's room where April set up her table. Everyone gathered around it and they explained to me that you had to close your eyes and concentrate, while lightly resting 2 fingers on top of the table and repeating with everyone in unison ""rise table, rise table, rise..."" over and over. Obviously I didn't take it seriously and giggled through it while everyone else was serious. And then? THE TABLE ROSE UP ON 2 LEGS AND JUST HOVERED THERE. The 2 legs had to be at least 12"" off the ground. I was obviously stunned when I opened my eyes and looked for any possible explanation as to how this was possible, but there was none. As long as we kept our index & middle fingers lightly on top, it stayed like that. 

The girls started to ask the table random questions, and if the answer was a ""yes"", it would lower the side that was raised up and almost touch the ground, and go back up and wait until the next question. If the answer was a ""no"", it wouldn't lower and would just stay raised up. Of course we asked stupid questions but the thing that really struck me was when they tried to guess which boy I liked (okay stupid, but I was 12!) and I can tell you that NOBODY knew who I liked as I was the new girl and kept it to myself, and as they guessed different boys - this table did not indicate a ""yes"" answer until they finally got around to asking if I liked the boy I actually had a crush on! How did it know? No one knew and trust me, I was discreet about it. 

Things turned darker after a while, and we tried to ascertain the origin of whatever was actually communicating with us. It felt like it was sucking us in deeper and deeper. We were tired and tried to say goodbye to it, but it wouldn't let us and seemed to get angry because it started to move up and down violently when answering a ""yes"" to our questions. The girl, April, had told us the one rule was that you couldn't just take your hands off of the table - You had to say goodbye properly and release it. Through asking yes or no questions, it said that it was a young child who still slept in a crib (red flag! How could a child that young understand any of our questions really?) who was smothered in aforesaid crib in the 1800s in England, and it wanted us to travel there to find its bones and bury it properly. Somebody asked it eventually if it knew who Jesus was, and it gave an answer of ""no"", and then when someone took a Precious Moments crucifix off of the wall and set it on the table it shook violently to knock it onto the floor. And that was pretty much enough for me at that point. Of course I couldn't sleep later (while everyone else slept soundly) and I was still scared even when I went home the next day.

As an adult in my 30s now, firmly rooted in logic and reason, when I look back I have more questions than answers. All I can say for certain is that this DID happen just as I've written above. It was no illusion, and nothing that the 10 of us collectively imagined that we were experiencing. I believe it was something very sinister that tried to suck in a bunch of little girls by pretending it was a child. Who knows what it wanted (nothing good!). More than anything for me, this first experience opened a door for me to have many other ones, including things like my talking candle, which perhaps I'll write about some other time on here. What do you think it was? Have you ever heard of or seen anything similar?"
"Mystery Water Puddles And 1 Flying Object","Nebraska","Haunted Places","Every so often my girlfriend and I will find 2 or more water puddles. We live in the basement, basically a mother in law apartment. It was concrete and back in the 70s they laid sheet vinyl down. 

A few months after moving in I woke up one morning walked towards the kitchen and stepped in water! I immediately looked up to see if the ceiling was leaking. It was bone dry. Being a floor guy I soaked up the water and examined the sheet vinyl thinking the water came up from the concrete. But how did it penetrate through the sheet vinyl? Also the sheet vinyl was still securely glued to the concrete. Usually if water gets under the vinyl it will cause the glue to no longer be adhered to the concrete. I began looking around and found a 2nd puddle 10 feet away. No pipes, no walls, no leak from the walls, ceilings, vinyl in tact. 

I installed new vinyl plank flooring down here over the existing sheet vinyl. The stuff is about 1/4 inch thick. And a few days ago after nothing for 10 months bam stepped in water again! Now how is water coming from underneath waterproof vinyl planks? I began looking and noticed a couple more puddles. I have yet to figure out what is causing these. 

If it is a spirit, it hasn't bothered us, except the one night a ceramic statue flew off the bookshelf and shattered while I was lying on the couch and my girl was in the bathroom. I immediately froze and yelled for her to come in the room as I am not a fan of paranormal anything! Lol.

 Thoughts anyone? I've read about poltergeist doing this, but nothing real bad has happened. There must be a logical explanation."
"Fort Benning/harmony Church","Georgia","Haunted Places","Previous to this incident, I had never experienced seeing any ""ghosts"" or apparitions.

I attended Infantry Basic Training/Advanced Individual Training at Fort Benning, GA in the Harmony Church area, from January through March of 1981. The barracks were two-story WWII-era buildings. Anyone who has been in the Army knows what ""Fire Guard"" is. 

I was on fire guard early (after midnight) one morning. The fire guard was required to have a flashlight, and you had to ""patrol"" the building constantly, during your one hour tour of duty. The barracks were completely dark, and were ""open bay"". There was a REALLY bad thunderstorm going on, at the time of this incident. Pouring rain, lightning, and thunder that was constant. The area outside the area was lit, but only by a couple of street lights, on the power poles. 

I was on the first floor, and was standing at the door of the barracks. I could see the fire guard's flashlight, in the adjacent building, approximately 25 yards away. That fire guard was close to that building's front door. I looked through the window, to my left, towards where the CQ was on duty. A huge bolt of lightning lit up the sky at that moment. 

On the sidewalk at the end of the building, approximately 50 feet away, I saw an older man, with long gray hair and a long gray beard. He was wearing what appeared to be cut-off jean shorts, and had no shirt on. He was standing very ""rigid."" I thought maybe I was just worn out, and was ""seeing things."" How could someone be standing in the pouring rain like that, with no shirt or rain gear on?

About 15 seconds after I saw the old man, the fire guard from the adjacent building came running towards our barracks, and came through the door. He seemed upset, and asked me: ""DID YOU SEE THAT OLD MAN?"" I almost passed out, knowing that what I saw was witnessed by another person. Needless to say, I don't think I slept very well, the rest of the morning.

I brought up the subject to my Drill Sergeant the next morning, and wasn't ready for his response. I figured the Drill Sergeant would tell me to ""move along, Private."" He stated something along the lines of: ""Yeah, I've seen him, too."" I was floored.

I'm posting this story in hopes that someone who has served in the Harmony Church area of Fort Benning, GA has experienced anything like this."
"Dream About Death Attracted A Spirit?","Minnesota","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","This experience happened to me last night (4/26/2019) at around 3 a.m., and is the most frightening experience I've had by far.

It started as a seemingly normal dream. In the dream it was a dark and rainy afternoon and I was wondering around a very small city exploring the buildings. Eventually, I was walking down a sidewalk and stopped in my tracks as I came upon a scene involving Mulder and Scully (two characters from the sci-fi show ""X-Files""). If you haven't seen it you can look up the two names and the show to get a picture of what these two actors look like. Funny enough, I haven't seen the show in years so it is interesting that they were involved in my dream. 

Anyways, Mulder was lying on his side in a fetal position as though he had been injured by something, and Scully had her head on top of his body and was listening for his heartbeat. Suddenly, I was in Mulder's position. He was no longer there, but I had ""taken his place"" laying on the sidewalk. Scully's head was resting on me now, listening for the heartbeat. 

As I was laying in this fetal position (on my left side), and could hear my heart beating very slowly but loudly. I could also hear my breathing slowing, and realized that I was dying. In those moments, I was accepting my death and almost trying to come to terms with it. I felt no fear during those moments. But then, I was taking my last big breath in, and the feeling of dying became overwhelmingly climactic -- I realized that I didn't really want to die and I became scared, and then my body started to get an intense buzzing-tingling feeling that felt like a wave moving from my lower back up to my head and my body was trying to paralyze itself (if that makes any sense). In that moment of fear, I jerked myself awake. I was laying on my futon and my covers where over my face and my body was still in the same exact fetal position I had been laying in during the dream. I was %1000000 awake, and my heart was racing and I was breathing at a normal/quicker pace now. 

As I said, my covers were over my entire body including my face and head (my room gets cold at night which is why I fall asleep like this sometimes in the first place -- also there was a breathing hole above my head where air was still coming through the cover so I could breath and was not suffocating). A few moments after awaking, I noticed that through my covers (which are lightweight and fairly see-through) the room looked bright as though it was the early morning. I reached over my head in front of me and lifted the blankets to peek out at the room to confirm that it was the morning light. When I pulled the covers down past my eyes, I saw the side profile of a whitish-blueish glowing face, with distinct features like the eye socket, mouth, nose, etc. The figure was about 12-24 inches away from my face, and I felt as though it was going to turn its head to look at me (it did not while I was looking at it). After maybe 2 or 3 seconds of seeing this thing, I reacted by quickly pulling the covers back over my head again in fear so that I could see it. Still, the presence of this being was overwhelmingly strong, and I felt like it was tied to me in particular and focusing on me (it did not ""feel"" like something that was attached to the room, if that makes any sense). I laid under my covers awake and scared and eventually turned around to my right side, sill hiding under the covers -- my phone was on this side of the futon and under the covers with me (I fall asleep with my phone next to me), so I checked the time and it read 3:20 a.m. 

I was sweating and it was difficult to breathe, I didn't care how uncomfortable it was because I was too frighted to bring my face above the covers in fear of seeing this entity again. I continued to feel the entity's presence for a while, and then it gradually faded and I became brave enough to check outside of the covers. When I did I noticed the room was almost pitch black and I could only see soft details of my desk and dresser, and at this point my eyes had adjusted to the dark. There were no logical explanations for the face and for the bright light it gave off because there are no significant sources of light in the room besides two or three small computer button lights which were on the opposite corner of the room from where I saw the entity, and are very faint lights (smaller than a pea). Unless I had a very vivid hallucination (which never happens to me, even when I've had sleep paralysis in the past), I have no debunking explanation for what I saw and felt.

Also I will note that this was not a sleep paralysis experience. I was not paralyzed and was consciously moving my body and interacting with the objects around me-and did not fall back asleep for another hour or so. I actually ended up going to the restroom after feeling like the entity was gone, and upon returning to my room, though on edge, did not feel like it was there anymore. 

I told my Mom of this experience, and she hypothesized that this spirit came because somehow my dream about dying/my intensely involved state of mind about death had somehow opened a veil of sorts to the spirit world that allowed something to come through to me, or perhaps made me vulnerable or likely to an experience with a spirit. 

My apologies for the length of this account, I tried to be as detailed as possible but please feel free to comment if you need me to clarify or further explain any parts of it. Otherwise, I'm interested to know if anyone else has had a similar experience with dream death and seeing spirits, or saw this spirit in particular or know what it was? It didn't feel necessarily evil or good, just neutral and I felt afraid because like most people, the supernatural does frighten me."
"Attending His Own Funeral?","North Carolina","Haunted Places","It's been about 3 years since I've posted up here, but I rarely have any paranormal experiences. This is the first one I've had in a long time. To start, I'll introduce myself. My name's John Gurganus and I'm 20 years old. I'm from North Carolina. This took place at my local church, Memorial Baptist Church, on Saturday, April 20th, 2019.

A week ago (April 17), my landlord passed away at the ripe old age of 85. His wake was held on the 19th and his funeral was on the 20th. 

I sat on the far left side on the front row. There's a little white wooden door that leads to a narrow hallway with some bathrooms. That door would open by itself. It was hot in that sanctuary, but I started feeling chills afer the door opened. Soon afterward, the lights flickered.

My entire family and the family to the left of me noticed the door open on its own, they closed and locked it, but it opened again anyway. No one else seemed to get the chills or notice the lights flickering.

Could this be his soul leaving his body and looking for a way out or was this another spirit? Maybe I was tripping and it wasn't a spirit at all? This as a very weird experience that I don't have an explanation for. 

The lights have flickered like this before, so maybe it's just faulty wiring, I wouldn't rule out any logical explanations, I just found it creepy considering the circumstances. If it was during any other service, I probably wouldn't have mentioned it, but for all this to happen during a funeral, that's a little bit unusual. Any suggestions on what this might be?"
"A Spirit Led Me To New York, To His Old Apartment","California","Haunted Places","I visited New York for the first time in January, while on tour (I'm a musician).

On the third night I had a dream about someone who was well known in entertainment, who had long been crossed over... (no they weren't a musician) 

The dream:

I was standing in Times Square by myself, in the snow in the middle of the night (3 or 4 am).

I felt fearful that there was no one else around, thinking I may be the last person left on Earth.

Just then from the shadows they emerged. 

They walked up to me, smiled at me, said ""Hi, I've been waiting for you"" then we began walking side by side together.

I woke up from the dream not thinking too much of it, other than it was odd I've never dreamt of them before and they're not someone whose usually on my mind or anything.

I went on with my day, and visited Central Park for the very first time.

I went and walked all around, then after being tired I went on sat on the steps of a random old brownstone building. 

I was looking up coffee shops to walk to nearby on my phone, when like a big sign, their name lit up in my mind.

I thought, ""why am I thinking of this person?""

I was curious now, and dropped my search for a coffee shop and felt compelled to google their name and read about them. 

I found an article about how they had an apartment in New York (I had no idea, I only knew they had lived in Los Angeles as they were in the entertainment industry when they were alive).

The article I read gave an address to the apartment they once lived in, I thought ""Maybe I should go see it while I'm in New York... If it's close enough to where I'm staying...""

So I typed the address into google maps...

I was sitting on the steps of their old apartment. 

No. Joke.

Of all the places in New York.

My jaw hit the ground...

After that I knew. I knew deep down there was more to this and it was very surreal. I felt absolutely compelled to figure it out. It was too synchronic given the dream the night before.

I went back to where I was staying, and I went so far as to contact the owner of the apartment building to ask if I can take a peek or go inside.

They graciously allowed me to take a tour of the apartment a couple days later. 

After I left New York, I went back to Los Angeles and things began happening.

Electronics, TV's turning on by themselves, I felt a warmth and loving energy surrounding me all the time, I'd wake up and feel something touching my hair lovingly but nothing there, an orb began appearing in every photo I would take, more dreams about this person started to occur.

I went to a medium, 

And she told me I need to go back to New York... Both because of this spiritual connection and because of my music career.

I was told many things will reveal themselves if I go, as well as my life will change in an amazing way.

I took her advice, and I went. 

I left 5 weeks later, and after becoming online friends in that time with owner of the apartment who belonged to this spirit, I was offered to be able to stay there a few weeks until I found a place of my own. 

What I have experienced has been so beautiful and surreal to say the least.

I would wake up in this apartment belonging to this spirit when he was alive. Being right there, it was so obvious this was supposed to happen. You can't plan things like that.

The dreams I've had had been lucid, incredible, emotional... Where they'd be sitting on the bed beside me while I slept and talking to me. 

Our energies would fuse in these dreams, and they obvious have very, very deep feelings for me. 

There is a little drum in the apartment that plays by itself (as if someone taps their hand on the drum a couple times) that the owner of the place said NEVER happened before I came there...

Other things like their energy - I can feel them all the time, their mood, everything.

I've become very close with this spirit many ways. 

A friend of mine thinks I had a past life with his spirit, or that this spirit is looking to have a spiritual marriage with me, or this spirit sees something in me and wants to help me on my creative path...

To be clear, I do not care that they were famous or well known or anything... From the get go what I have felt is all spiritual, as I didn't really have much interest in them before they came to me spiritually. I know in the spirit world we are all equal and notoriety has nothing to do with anything... There is a soul connection going on here, this is not some kind of boasting about a famous spirit, I could care less. It's the emotion and reality of what's happening that has me so wanting to learn more.

Just typing this it's the most surreal thing that's ever happened to me, and it has also revealed spiritual abilities within me I didn't know I had to the extent that I do.

I'm typing this here, because I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced anything similar or if you all have insight or theories on this.

Also any advice on how to strengthen the connection, or anything would help too.

No trolling please. None of this is made up, and I'm just trying to make sense of such a huge thing that before January was not even a thought in my mind... I wasn't looking for this, but such a thing I felt it would be a disservice not to follow the signs..."
"The Ghost Who Came To Rehearsal","Minnesota","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","Thank you in advance for taking the time to read my story. It is my first time posting here. I've experienced many unexplainable things but this is one that has stayed with me. 

In a scenic Minnesota city, near where I went to college, there is a theatre that is storied to be haunted by a mischievous ghost. 

This ghost, or the Blue Man, was known to move props, mess with curtains, and turn the stage lights on and off during performances. Stage managers would talk about things going wrong in the booth and then suddenly fixing themselves. Actors would talk about weird feelings or shadows backstage. And several people that I knew had reported to have seen a man in blue coveralls, shaggy light hair, and 70s style glasses around the theatre. The theatre was attached to an old train depot so it stands to reason that the ghost was a worker or engineer, but I do not know that to have ever been confirmed. 

Being an actor and a paranormal believer, I loved hearing stories of this supposedly haunted theatre. No one ever felt threatened or that anything evil was there, if anything, stage managers and crew would be annoyed because inevitably during every production, something would be amiss. 

I only worked there twice, both times in musicals. 

The first show, I played a lead and would come in early and was often the last person to be dismissed from rehearsal. I tend to pretty sensitive to paranormal things and was aware of that feeling of being watched or that uneasy feeling of not being alone but not being able to place why. I was pretty consumed with rehearsals though and didn't spend time thinking about ghosts or the Blue Man, until he came to rehearsal one night. 

To paint a better picture of the theatre itself, it's a proscenium stage, one of those big places with fly space and wing space, the stage about 3 ft from the floor where the audience sits. The house itself has few hundred seats, all in a slight semi-circle facing the stage. The lighting booth was dead center in the back. Its important to note that there are center aisles. Audiences would enter from the lobby through double doors and then could go left or right through a swinging door (that was propped open before the show and at intermission, but then closed during the performance by ushers) and would have get to their seats from either of the two side aisles. This means that if your seat was in the middle, you had quite a number of seats to walk by to get there. Each row had between 20-30 seats or so. 

The two swinging doors at the exits were very heavy and would bang loudly if you didn't catch them or close them carefully. To minimize disturbances and interruptions during rehearsals, the stage left door, was always bolted shut. So basically, the only way into the theatre from the audience was the door on stage right. The only door into the lighting booth was also on stage right. 

Alright, so one night, per the norm, I was the only actor left and was working on the stage with the director and assistant director. Everyone else had left either through the back loading dock or through the stage right door to the lobby. We had been working for a good 45 minutes and were the only three people left in the building. 

I was standing on stage, toward the edge of the stage. The director and AD were on the floor in the audience in front of me, comparing notes in a script that was lying on the edge of the stage. We were all leaning over it, the two of them were discussing something, and I suddenly got this overwhelming feeling that I was being watched. I looked up and there he was. In the very back row, far left corner of the audience, was a man with shaggy hair and 70s style glasses. It looked like he was wearing a gray button down to me and I only saw him from mid-chest up, like he was either sitting in that corner seat or standing behind it. I did a bit of a double take because I wasn't expecting anyone else to be there and hadn't seen or heard anyone come in (I was on stage and had been performing straight out to the audience and would have seen if anyone came in). I thought oh it must be a janitor or the parent of one of the kids in the show, so I went back to looking at the script. The director and AD didn't seem to notice him and were still talking so I straightened up and looked back at the guy in the back of the house. We had eye contact, he was looking right at me. I smiled at him and did a little, half-wave at him. He didn't respond but kept looking at me. I looked down at the script and in a split second thought ""Wait, no one else is here"" and immediately looked up again and he was gone. 

I was stunned, literally frozen, staring at where he had been. It was only then that I remembered the description of the Blue Man and thought, Oh my god, that must have been him! The Director and AD asked me something and brought my attention back to them. I asked if everyone else had gone and they said yes and that we had to exit out the back because the janitor had locked everything in the front when he left 45 minutes earlier. Neither of them saw anyone else or seemed to feel anything or to even notice that I was a bit shook up. We packed up our stuff and I watched as the AD walked to the stage left door in the audience and pulled on it- it was locked. He walked all the way across the back row of seats to the stage right door, pulled on it to make sure it was locked, and then we turned off the lights and exit through the loading dock together.

When I got to my car, my heart started racing faster as I tried to reasonably explain what I had seen. It COULD have been a janitor (it didn't look like the janitor but it could have been one I hadn't met yet.) But if it was, I would've had to have seen him leave. I had looked away from him for no more than a second and the man was gone. How could he have gotten out? The only door that was open during rehearsals was stage right and I would have seen him walking across the back row, just like the AD had to do to check the doors. He could not have gone into the lighting booth because that entrance was also on the right. If he had keys, he would've had to either unlock it before he left or lock it after he left and that would have taken time and all three of us would've heard that deadbolt turn. He would've had to stand and open that swinging door, which I would've seen, and if he left in a hurry, he would've had to let the door close on its own (or I would've seen it close) but there was no loud door slam. 

The more I thought, the more convinced I was that I had seen the Blue Man. My first time seeing an apparition, it was kind of a big deal. But then I started to worry. He liked to mess around with things like curtains and cables and lights in the wing space and fly space during shows and this particular show involved actual flying with cables and harnesses. I was suddenly worried that one of his pranks could affect the rigging and someone (like me or children) could get hurt. 

The next night I got to rehearsal early. No one else was on the stage, the ghost light was still there, and I walked down stage center to where I had been standing when I saw him. I felt like someone was watching me and my chest felt tight and I was excited and nervous as I looked out into the house, all around the stage and up in the rafters. I said something to the effect of- Hello. I'm (insert name) and I'm playing (insert role). Thank you for coming to rehearsal last night. It's nice to meet you. We're all very excited for the show but I'm really nervous about flying and all the harness and cables. Would you mind keeping an eye on us and keeping us safe?- and then I thanked him again for coming to rehearsal and for sharing the space with us. 

I didn't see him again after that. I sometimes felt things backstage but for the most part, paranormally speaking, things were quiet the rest of rehearsals. People even commented on how they hadn't seen or heard from The Blue Man yet. We got through all the rehearsals and all of the performances without a single problem with props or lights or sound or cables (well, that couldn't be obviously explained by human error). At the cast party, the stage manager and I were talking and she said it was the first show she had ever done there when the Blue Man didn't do ANYTHING, and she had been doing shows there for years. When I told her about what I had experienced, she smiled and nodded her head and said, well, must've made a friend. 

I don't know if that's true but I'm very glad to have had that interaction. I think because I said hello that first night and asked him nicely to keep us safe, that we had some kind of understanding, at least for that show. 

The very next musical, I was also in. I didn't see him or even really feel his presence during rehearsals but then one night during the first huge company number, the stage lights suddenly all went out. The actors and musicians kept going and a minute or so later the lights all suddenly came back on. The show must go on and no one missed a beat but at intermission, I found the stage manager (who was in the booth controlling the lights) and asked her, ""what happened?"" She sort of laughed and said, ""I guess he's back at""."
"Edmund Fitzgerald Exhibit","Michigan","Haunted Places","I was born in Michigan and recall back in November, 1975, when the ore carrier Edmund Fitzgerald sank during a violent storm in Lake Superior. All hands were lost during the sinking and no bodies were ever recovered because the ship sank so suddenly. The sinking was about 15 miles from Whitefish Point where the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum currently resides.

 In September of 2018, I was in Northern Michigan on business. I had some time to kill and decided to visit the museum. After crossing the Mackinaw Bridge, I began the 1 1/2 drive the museum. What once a sunny and warm day had turned cold, gray, and rainy. I experienced uneasy feelings as I drove the desolate upper peninsula roads. I could not understand why, but I dismissed the feelings to overwork and stress.

 I finally arrived at the museum in a downpour. I ran inside and paid the admission fee to a friendly middle aged woman. I was the only one there. The museum was laid out well with exhibits and artifacts; from shipwrecks starting in the 1800's and ending with the Edmund Fitzgerald. By the time I reached the Fitzgerald exhibit, I learned very little was recovered from the shipwreck because it sank so quickly. However, a lifeboat broke free during the sinking and was recovered the following day. With the lifeboat was a case which included a flare gun, lantern, first aid kit, and other items. Those items were displayed in a glass case. As I studied the items, the earlier feelings of anxiety returned. Within seconds, anxiety turned to fear and after that turned to pure terror. I was so light headed, I thought I was fainting. I was able to collect myself and bolted for the exit. I went right by the front desk where the lady was and went back outside. My heart was racing, my breath was short, and I thought my head would explode. I soon collected myself and asked, ""What just happened?""

 I decided to go back inside to confront what just occurred. I walked right past the lady again and into the museum. Within seconds the same emotions of anxiety, fear, and terror swept over me. There was no negotiation and I exited the museum again with no intention of returning. I spoke with the lady and told her I just had a paranormal experience by the Fitzgerald exhibit. She admitted to being a sensitive herself and said the museum is highly active. She also said once or twice a week, visitors will have an experience similar to mine, or see apparitions, or even hear voices calling for help. This was reassuring because I thought I was going nuts. I have had my share of psychic or paranormal experiences in my life but this by far the most intense.

 During the drive back to my motel, I thought about the anxiety, fear, and terror I experienced and realized that is what those doomed crew members felt. Anxiety during the storm, fear when the ship was losing control, and terror when they realized it was sinking."
"Visit From Grandad/dreams? Part 2","Minnesota","Family / Friends Visits","This is part 2 of a story I submitted called ""Visit from Grandad/dreams?"" It is important to read that story first and then return to this one!

I posted the story ""Visit from Grandad/dreams?"" sometime spring of 2018, without having told my grandma of this experience (who had been widowed of course and very upset after his death) I didn't want to make her upset by telling her he said goodbye to me through a dream state. I told my mom, however not as detailed as described on Your Ghost Stories, and she also did not tell my grandma.

This past summer (2018), I traveled alone to Florida to visit my grandma in her house. She still hasn't healed from my grandad's death. One day, she was upset about him and I decided to tell her my story about how he said goodbye to me in my dream. I told her all of the details of the stairs, the hallway, the location of the doors, his outfit, etc. 

In response to my dream she said something like, ""oh -- that sounds a lot like the house we used to live in, in Iowa."" I asked her more about it and she said that the house is exactly as my dream had looked; a short wooden stairway leading up to a door at the top that had a bright window in the room, and to the left a hallway that had some doors at the end. My grandparents both lived this house for a short while. She said that when my grandpa lived there, my grandad was in the best shape of his life, going on runs every day. 

She also told me that MANY years ago, when later owners of the house had put the house on sale and had visitors touring it, a family claimed to see a fisherman at the doorway at the top of the stairs (same ones from my dream, same area my grandma mentioned). The man they saw, they said was a ghost. My great grandfather (on my grandma's side), who had been dead for some years before that, was a fisherman. 

As I mentioned, these stories are new to me -- I knew nothing of these instances or anything of that house before my dream with my Grandpa. Given that my grandpa visited me at a place (in my dream) where he was the healthiest in life and was also dressed as though he were going to exercise, and the fact that others years ago have seen a ghost in that very same doorway of another one of my family members, I can't help but believe that my grandfather chose that location to say goodbye to me for a reason. Do you think he knew I would end up making these connections and figuring it out? Does that house just continue to hold some kind of spiritual energy in my family or act as a gateway to the spirit world?

Thanks everyone for reading, I would love to hear some comments or questions (appropriate and kind please:)"
"Haunted Townhouses At Lacey","Washington","Haunted Places","When I left the Army, I tried to make a go of it in the state I got out in (Washington) but I soon realized that this was a mistake.

This was a very expensive place to live in and the only property I could afford to rent that would allow me to keep my dog was in the town of Lacey (effectively a suburb of Olympia) where my family moved into a townhouse.

The property itself wasn't particularly historical. Nothing had been built on it before the townhouses and prior to Lacey's founding, it'd been owned by a Catholic monastery which now doubles as a Catholic college. 

The townhouses were all duplexes, set very close together, with an alley about eight feet wide between each townhouse, and a very small front yard. Most of the neighbors didn't talk to each other, though my younger daughter did make a few friends. One of the things that I noticed in the three years that I lived there (only because I couldn't afford to move) was the rate at which people would move. Next door went through three tenants. That's three people moving in and out on the house to my left and three to the right. Two families moved in and out across the street and the rest of the town was very much following the same patterns. One day while one of my former neighbors was dropping off her daughter to spend the night with my daughter, she described having heard disembodied footsteps along the stairs and voices.

In my own house things were unfortunately more interesting. 

It started with footsteps, and creaks not explainable by the house settling. 

Then boxes stacked very stably in the garage would suddenly fall over. It went on like that for around two years, with just little things here and there. A missing item would turn up, an item would go missing, something would tip or someone would hear something, but then it got worse, during the last year. 

My oldest daughter was physically chased out of our house by an unseen force throwing books, while home alone. I know she didn't make this up.

My youngest daughter was slapped, also by an unseen force.

Doors would occasionally close, albeit not particularly dramatically.

The big one that finally sealed the deal for me, though, was the shadow man.

I awoke one night and saw the figure standing in my bedroom doorway. The door was open, despite my having closed it before I went to bed. This thing was literally darker than the darkness around it. It was like a complete absence of light in the shape of a man. There were no facial features at all. No eyes, no ears, nothing. Just perfect smooth darkness. I was completely paralyzed and unable to even make a sound and then the thing moved.

I've read other shadow man accounts since this happened, and they never seem to do the experience justice. These things seem like they are walking at a leisurely pace, and yet the way they move is impossible to describe. It's fast and very, very fluid. Nothing physical seems to obstruct them; one moment this thing was in my doorway and in another second it was next to me, with its hands around my throat, throttling me in my own bed; I could feel it, but not so much as a physical touch as a physical pressure. I have seen, done and been through some horrible things in my time and I promise you that I had no idea how afraid I could become until this particular moment. That fear seemed to boil into anger, though. I don't know if the sudden burst of outrage changed something for the shadow man but as soon as I became angry it vanished and I could move again. As strange as this sounds, I think it was a little afraid of me at that second.

About four months later my income tax came in, and I wisely used that money to move my family to our new home in Tennessee to be closer to our family. I definitely get the sense that things had been escalating and would have gotten worse if we had not moved."
"Dream Home Nightmare","Texas","Haunted Places","A few years ago my ex husband and I moved our new little family into a cute 3 bedroom little house. It was painted blue, and therefore has since been called the blue house. The 1st week there we were in our living room watching television, when a massive shadow went up the wall behind us, onto the ceiling where a mist formed with it. It moved across the ceiling down the hallway and disappeared into the nursery. I was a die hard skeptic at this time. My ex husband asked me if I saw it. I am ashamed to say, I told him I had and that it was merely someones headlights outside. He argued that the windows were not near any road and the mist was not explained by this theory. I shrugged it off and accepted my explanation anyway. 

We began having experiences hearing footsteps running down the hallway to bathroom; banging and scratching on the walls; toys turning on and off without batteries; hearing children cry outside the nursery window; large shadow and mists movement daily; a full body apparition of a woman, the kids complaining they could not sleep because ""they"" would not leave them alone; cold spots, lights flickering and going off, sounds of heavy furniture being moved around in the vacant bedroom; the television coming on and or going off on its own accompanied by an odd high pitched hum and sometimes a faint sound of music. I continued to find explanations for these events and ignored what I could.

As things escalated everyone in the household experienced nightmares, and some of us began sleep walking. I was one of them and I had the most frequent episodes. I would wake up under the kitchen table; on the floor in odd places; and even outside. There would be mud on my feet and other signs I had been outside. My family said I would have my eyes open but I did not respond to them like myself and I seemed vacant. 

We were advised to try and get EVP. To talk to it. To ask questions. Doing this was our undoing.

We caught some low class EVP's in the question and answering stage. Nothing alarming or conclusive. Following our EVP session when we went to bed something growled. I was in bed and my ex husband was reaching up to the ceiling fan to turn the light off leaving the fan on. Something growled angrily from the foot of the bed. I thought it was our dog. I found her at my mother's feet, in the den, where she had been when I left to go to bed. We searched our property outside and found nothing. Even after all that I was convinced some stray or even my dog growling must be what we heard.

Later that night I woke to something strange. My computer monitor was visible at the foot of the bed. Standing in front of the monitor was the silhouette of my shirtless ex husband. His back was to me and he was just standing there. I called out to him but he didn't answer or turn around. Something told me to look at his side of the bed. I did and nothing was there. I looked back and my husband had vanished into thin air. 

I realized that what I had seen couldn't have been a person. I smelled something burning. Then the covers began to be pulled down off of me. I froze. The air conditioner was a window unit. It began to beep and go from low fan to medium fan to high fan then back to low over and over. In unison with each fan cycle change the blinds were flipping open and shut, along with banging on the walls. 

I suddenly became a little girl. I felt like all the air hang been sucked out of my body. I could not take air in to make a sound. I am embarrassed to say I urinated on myself. When I finally could take air, I gasped and began screaming for my mother like a child. I mustered the courage to finally move and reached for the door knob next to the bed. At that moment my husband came in and flipped the light on at which point it all stopped. He had been in the bathroom vomiting. His mysterious illness stopped right then as well. 

I looked for a new home. I no longer was the skeptic.

 Before moving I found a necklace on my dresser one day. I thought it was left there as a gift so I put it on thinking nothing of it. A couple days later I woke to a blinding headache. My husband got up to get my migraine medicine but fainted just outside our bedroom. I got up and went down too. I crawled to the kids room. I found my son first. I got him aroused enough to help walk him outside. I went back into the house for my daughter and husband. My husband crawled out while I located our daughter. She was 3 at the time. I found her tiny little body blue and unresponsive in her bedroom. I drug her out the front door thinking after I called 911 I would return to the home and lay down. I believed my daughter dead and wished to follow. My thinking was very muddled. 

I went in and retrieved the phone. Passing out twice in this process. When I returned to the front door, my daughter's eyes were open. So I laid down in the yard and called for help. When paramedics and firemen arrived, I was told we had carbon monoxide poisoning. The firemen said 30 per square feet was lethal. My home was over 500 per square feet. Just short of barbecuing in the living room, no explanation for those levels was found in the home. No one in my family knew where the necklace had come from. I removed it at the hospital and left it there. 

We moved shortly after that. The last night everyone was at our new home while I was at the blue house cleaning so we could collect our deposit. I was tired from the night before. The whispers and banging on the walls were relentless. I was in my bedroom when someone knocked on the door. I went and looked through the peephole and see the silhouette of a man I believed to be the neighbor across the street. I saw him lean down and look into the peep hole, then a bright light behind him appears and he turned and walked away. I opened the door and no one was there.

After shutting the door I realize he had stooped down to look in the peep hole at me. How is that possible I thought. He wasn't taller than me. Anxiety hits as it begins to hit me that the tall man could not have been my neighbor or any normal human being. My lungs seize up. I rush to the bedroom to get my rescue inhaler out of my purse.

That's the last thing I remember. The next thing I can recall I am slamming into a wall, falling from a standing position. I am in the living room. I am freezing. I have never been so cold. I looked around and was very confused about where I was. I didn't recognize it without the furnishings.

I am so cold my jaw was chattering. I wander briefly through the home trying to get my bearings as to where I am. I go into the bathroom. At this point, I begin to have a dejavu feeling, like I know, that I know this place, but I can not put it together in my head. It is fuzzy and slow moving. 

I am desperate to get warm. I can see in the mirror that my lips are blue. ""What the hell is wrong with me"" I think. I begin filling the tub with hot water and I strip quickly climbing in. 

As the water fills and my body begins to warm I see my cell phone on the floor next to the tub. It must have fallen out of my bra when I was undressing. I used to keep my cell phone in my bra along with money etc. I pick it up and call my husband.

When he answered I started crying. ""I just woke up. I'm so cold.""

He was frantic, ""where are you! Where have you been! I have been calling you for hours. You didn't come home!""

I looked around the bathroom. I finally recognized it. I told him I was at the blue house.

""Babe where have you Been? We last spoke over 5 hours ago. Its 3am."" He said.

I took about half an hour to warm my body enough that I would get out of the tub. My husband came and got me. I was too confused to even figure out how to get home on my own. I can not express how terrifying this was. 

It turned out the man I thought I saw had passed away.

I don't know what I was doing in that 5 hours. It's scary to be up doing things with no recollection of it.

I don't know what happened to me that night or why. Seizure maybe? I try not to think about it.

We have continued to have issues, but very mild in comparison. We did lose one of our children to suicide about a year after moving. I can't help wonder if it had anything to do with what attacked me. Had it attacked him after leaving the blue house? He left no note. I am left never knowing.

I have accepted that there are no answers for me. My best friend lives next door to the blue house. She says that the new neighbors do not complain of having any issues. She had experienced something every time she had come into the blue house when I lived there. She has not experienced anything while on any of her visits to the new neighbors. I am too terrified to even pass the house. I do not visit her in her home. She comes to visit me. 

I am a shadow of the person I once was. The events at the blue house severely traumatized me and my family. My son's death sent me over the edge into a full nervous breakdown. Which is not as dramatic as it may sound. I simply quit functioning. I closed myself off from the world and just stopped. I could not remember how to do a job I had done daily for 5 years. I had to be walked through it daily until I was terminated. I cried so much that my face was chapped all the time. Even now, 4 years later, I am struggling to reclaim my life. I pray no one else comes into contact with whatever that thing was.

 Thanks for reading my story. Sharing it helps me let it go and heal. I am open to alternate explanations and discussions. You do not have to agree with me, and you can even think I am crazy. I only ask that you be respectful. Crazy or not, my life has been shattered into pieces because of what I experienced. Thank you. Shine on.

"Fairy Lights","Illinois","Orbs / Lights / Mists","As most of you who have read my submissions know, I've had a lot of experiences with the paranormal. I'm not saying that as a form of bragging or to impress, it's just a statement of fact. However, until recently, I thought I had not encountered the most commonly claimed; that of seeing orbs. Not in any picture I ever took, or any unexplained happening have I seen anything I'd term an orb. 

At least, that's what I thought, until I read ""Biblio At Warwick Castle"" (https://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=26429), and his description of an orb he witnessed. 

This particular line, ""I did not wear glasses at that point in time, so I know it wasn't a reflection; it looked like an electric dandelion seed, floating lazily about the room about five feet above the floor,"" had me sitting open mouthed, with the phrase Fairy Lights dancing across my mind, as I was catapulted back decades to when I was a child. Until I read his description I never, ever thought that perhaps they were orbs... Just wee bits of a magical realm I was allowed to see. 

Back then, I was somewhat of a middle child; the twins (18 years my senior) were married, and my oldest brother was off to war. That left my two older brothers, two younger siblings and myself with our parents. Naturally being 4 and 5 years younger than the boys, and a GIRL to boot, my brothers would often ditch me unless I could be of some use to them. My remaining sister was 2 years younger, and baby brother was 5 years my junior; Mom was often too busy with them or sorting out the older ones to pay me much mind. 

I was about 6 when I saw the lights the first time. We had just moved, yet again. This house had a very large yard, with a field running next to it. It was dusk, and we 'older' kids were almost dizzy with the freedom of being outside without a grown up. We had been shown the yard's perimeter and instructed to stay in it, but that didn't stop my brothers from giving me the dodge, so I was alone with our dog, Rebel, playing in the light that flowed from the house's windows. 

When I saw the first light, I remember thinking, 'lightening bug', but then I noticed it didn't blink, the way they do. It was a steady glow, very soft, and a bit fuzzy at the edges. I watched as it floated about and was soon joined by another, and another. I remember thinking how pretty they were, as dozens of these miniature 'electric dandelion seeds', soon appeared, some coming quite close to me, before changing direction and rejoining the others. I glanced at Rebel, who had seated himself by my side. He gave no indication of anything being amiss, but seemed to be watching them too. 

Being six, I decided that those lights could only be the lights of fairies off to some wondrous party. I watched them fade out of sight.

The lights were not a nightly thing, but then neither was being outdoors at dusk. I tried telling about them, but was only laughed at, told I was mistaken, and they were lightening bugs. After that, I kept my sightings to myself. 

Flash forwards a few years. We've moved several times, and the fairy lights seem to be a thing of the past. It's winter, and I'm finally coming home from a short hospital stay. (Nothing dramatic, just a simple tonsil and adenoid removal.) There had been some complications and instead of being overnight, I had been kept nearly a week. I'm almost 12, and sit in the back seat being quiet, and looking out the window. My throat was still raw, making speech difficult, which was just as well; my father had already made it quite clear that he'd rather be doing anything else but bringing me home, while my Mom was quietly euphoric about it, reaching back to pat my hand now and then, or asking me if I was hungry. It wouldn't have surprised me if she'd had jello in her purse in case I said yes. 

It's almost dark as we approach the big bridge going home. It's a very long bridge, something like 507 feet long. I gaze out, down into the water, and see tiny fairy lights dancing here and there. Mentally I sort them out from the reflected lights. I hear my dad ask what the hell am I looking at. Without thinking I croak, ""the fairy lights."" I hear him tell my mom that with an imagination like mine I'd never be lonely. Just then, one came up quite close to my window, and stayed even with us as we crossed the bridge's span. At the end it turned going through the girder. I didn't bother to even mention it. But, it's always been enough for me to know that no matter where I was there was always the possibility of fairy lights."
"Kid In The Hall","New York","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","As I always like to do when I'm stuck in a boring meeting at work, I looked across the courtyard windows to watch what the people in other offices are doing for work and what their setups look like compared to ours. It's a little bit voyeuristic, but passes the time. 

The other day I noticed one office that was completely dark, stuffed with boxes and not a living soul inside, which I found odd because that building never struggles to find tenants and all other floors were at the time were packed with workers. 

Yet I gravitated towards it because of some movement that looked a bit out of the ordinary. It started as a light that kept flicking on and off, with my eyes going from my boss's desk to that window and back again. 

Then out of the corner of my eye I kept seeing movement. And when I glanced back over there the next time I saw something that made a chill go right down my spine. In between all the massive boxes I saw the face of a child staring straight into my eyes. At first thinking it may have been a take your kids to work day in their office, I gave a wave in that direction. 

Then I glanced back at my colleagues for a split second, and when I looked back at the child it was gone. I kept my eyes fixated on that window in case the kid came back, but after five minutes nothing. Not a soul in that office and all lights off. 

By this point my boss could tell I was distracted, he asked a simple question and I bumbled the answer, still a bit shaken by what I'd seen. Could not focus again for the rest of the day and money was lost. I think it may have been a lost soul, possibly stirred up by a new company moving in or out of the space. Still get a little bit uneasy every time I gaze out at that window."
"My Creepy Final Visit To Our Haunted Family Home","Massachusetts","Haunted Places","My great-aunt, who has lived for years in an 1890s Victorian home, which has been in our family for generations, recently was moved to assisted living. The home, which was featured in my first story posted to this site and is where I was choked by an unforeseen force by an old necklace, is falling apart, contaminated, and will likely be condemned and demolished. Shortly before my great-aunt was moved to assisted living, the plumber called to inspect water drainage issues in the downstairs sink reported the conditions of the home to the town health inspector, and we were able to negotiate with the town for one final visit to the home to remove family heirlooms and personal belongings, after which the house is likely to be condemned.

As I pulled up to the house ready to meet the rest of my family for a final walkthrough of the house, I was filled with sadness. Clearly once a beautiful home and one of the largest on its street, with its gingerbread trim, multiple gables, and large windows framed with old-fashioned drapes, this was the first home my great-grandparents owned after their arrival to the United States, and the one where my grandmother grew up. I hated the thought that it will be demolished. More importantly, I wondered what unforeseen spirits dwell within its walls. Are my ancestors still among us? And what about those of its even earlier owners?

I met my family outside the front of the house, and my grandmother unlocked the front door with a spare key. I stood back, staring up at the house, and saw a curtain on one of the attic windows billowing slightly. Was it a draft, or something else? I grabbed my mother's attention but the second she looked up, it stopped. As she turned away, I noticed in another attic window the shadow of what appeared to be a dark-skinned female figure in a white dress pass by and just disappear into the distance as quickly as she appeared. Knowing the house was completely empty of living people for the first time in 130 years creeped me out. 

The yellow wallpaper in the front hallways was chipped. The floors creaked louder than ever. And though there were windows throughout the house, there was an oppressive darkness that no light from outside could penetrate and an inescapable feeling that we were not alone. Who did I just see in the upstairs window? 

We split up throughout the house searching for items to keep. I was to search the attic and second floor, my stepdad the basement, and everyone else the first floor. The electrical wiring on the upper two floors has not been modified in years, so I was instructed not to turn on any lights. As such, the upper two floors felt dark and ominous, especially the upstairs hallway. The dark doors on all sides and the wood paneling in that hallway combined with the lack of natural sunlight suffocate you as you pass through the hallway and it feels like you are being stared down by eyes from all corners. In that hallway, now just as before, I felt as if something would jump out at me from behind any one of the doors or from behind any corner. I quickly darted into the nearest room. I entered what was once the upstairs dining room when it was a two-family home, and began going through boxes. I found old photographs of my great-grandparents, cousins, and ancestors from the 1800s.

In one box, I found an old key that seemed to go to one of the locks on an old door. Curious as to what it unlocked, I tried the key in multiple doors upstairs but it just did not fit in any door. I searched every room for it. I entered what was the upstairs kitchen and noticed dishes in the sink that had been left there for 40 years, an out of commission stove and refrigerator, and an iron sitting on an ironing board. It looked like it was still lived in but its owners just...disappeared. I finally found the lock for the key. It locked the door leading to the narrow back staircase, which opened into the downstairs kitchen. 

As I put the key in the lock and locked the door, I could hear my mother calling me from what sounded like the front of the house, so I ran back toward the front of the house to find out what she wanted. In the front hallway, I saw the attic door open and could hear boxes being moved around up there. I assumed that my mom and aunt were upstairs searching through boxes, so I called up the stairs. No answer. I called my aunt's name. No answer. Staring up the winding stairs still hearing footsteps and boxes being moved, I instantly started sweating and got scared. I called out to them again ""This isn't funny. What do you want?"" Leaving the attic door open, I darted up the attic stairs into a hallway that was barely 6 feet to the ceiling, narrow, with white walls and green doorways and trim. At the top of the stairs, the hallway bends rightward, and there are rooms on all sides packed from ceiling to floor with boxes, old bed frames, box springs, and other assorted items.

 I had only been in the attic once or twice and honestly forgot what it looked like, and this is where it gets creepy. I could just see into the rooms enough to notice that they were not typical attic rooms, they looked like bedrooms. Clearly another family had lived up there, and the house had once been a three-family home. Right now, however, the place was as abandoned as it could be. Not only was no one up there, but there is no way boxes could have been being moved up there without first moving them into the hallway, as the doorway to every room in the attic was COMPLETELY BLOCKED OFF by stacked boxes. It was difficult to even see into any of the rooms. Suddenly, I could hear rustling of paper bags from the room at the very end of the hall, and the curtain blowing around, but there was absolutely no air conditioning or draft and I could clearly see the window was bolted shut. I suddenly felt as if I was being watched from that back room. I could hear a sound emanating from multiple corners in the attic that sounded like coins being dropped, one by one, against the wooden floor and rolling across the floor, followed by the giggling of small children. At this point I'd had enough. I quickly bolted down the stairs and when I made it to the bottom, smashed right into the closed door... The CLOSED door. The door I knew for a fact I left opened. I reached for the knob and though I used all my might, I just could not open it. The knob turned completely but the door felt as if it was being pushed on from the other side by someone just slightly stronger than me. 

Suddenly, I could hear soft footsteps making their way down the attic hall, bumping into one of the old wooden doors off its frame left lying in the upstairs hallway. I could hear the click, click, click of heels as they turned the corner making their way to the top of the stairs. My heart raced and my palms drenched in sweat as I pounded on the door for someone to let me out. I shouted the name of every person I knew to be in the house, until I got someone's attention. The sound of the heels stopped at the top of the stairs, but slowly made their way down. I could see a shadow emerging on the cracked white walls, a silhouette getting larger but without any defined features as the entity crept down the stairs, one slow step at a time. I grabbed that doorknob like my life depended on it and tried breaking it off the door, pushing and shoving until the door finally gave way. I stepped into the hallway, slammed the door shut, and turned to run back downstairs, but as I did, I stepped on what felt like a piece of paper in the upstairs hallway. It was a photograph of the same woman I thought I saw in the attic window and who I heard up in the attic. What was she trying to tell me? 

I ran downstairs in a panic, desperately seeking answers. I demanded to know if any of my family members were up in the attic trying to play a prank on me. They all insisted they had been downstairs the entire time, which puzzled me because I know for a fact I heard my mother's voice coming from the attic. Just as I started to assume that it was my imagination, I could hear footsteps coming from the floor immediately above me, pacing around across the upstairs kitchen, directly above where I now stood. Everyone could hear it, and I could see the panic in everyone's faces. My stepdad, who does not believe in the paranormal, whispered to us that someone had likely broken into the house and was hiding upstairs, likely having been living there since my great-aunt was taken to assisted living if not even longer, as she was hearing impaired and never went upstairs. He snuck upstairs on the back staircase, slowly and quietly, with me following behind with pepper spray in hand, ready to confront the ""intruder."" I was certain we would not see one. When we got to the top of the back staircase, the door, which I knew I shut and locked with the old key, was slightly cracked and slowly opening. Someone was, clearly, inviting us in. 

We searched the entire upstairs of the house and then the attic, and I felt somewhat more comfortable with a male relative there. There was no one, and nothing that could have made any of the noises on either floor. We began to leave the attic, my stepdad in front and me behind. As I was about halfway down the stairs, I stumbled forward. I distinctly felt hands on my shoulders and something rub against the back of my neck. Whatever it was did not push me, but I nearly fell down the stairs with fright. I began screaming, pushing my stepdad out of the way and running downstairs to the first floor. There was no way I was going back to that attic under any circumstance. My step dad stayed on the second floor, searching through different rooms. He believed I had imagined the entire thing and there was nothing to be afraid of. 

My grandmother was still sweeping downstairs and trying to make the house look somewhat presentable, likely believing she could persuade the town to spare the house. 

I showed her the photograph I found outside the attic door, asking if she recognized the face. Surely enough, she recognized her, and her story was truly sad. I came to find out that the woman was my great-grandmother's sister, who had lived in the attic of the house with her three children after her husband passed away. She lived there for a short period of time in the 1940s, out of sight and rarely came downstairs. Because of her darker complexion and the belief that her visible presence in the house would cause people to question my great-grandmother's race, she was told she could live there but told to not come down in the presence of guests. One of her children died in the attic with scarlet fever. My great-grandmother descends from a long line of mixed race people, of both European and African descent, and unfortunately believed that her light skin and ability to ""pass"" as a white woman made her superior to her sister. Until this day, I never knew of the existence of this relative, but her story deeply saddens me. I have come to wonder if every incident in this house was her way of making herself known, and the injustices that happened to her. 

My step dad eventually came downstairs, his face pale and flustered. He demanded to know if I had been playing some sort of practical joke on him. He claims that he would be in one room upstairs, and all of the rooms are connected with multiple doors to each, and he would hear a doorknob turn in another room. When he would look up, he would see a door slowly clicking shut and closing. He would go to that door and open it and look around, and there would be no one in the room, but suddenly the door to that room leading to the one he was just in would shut behind him on its own, rinse and repeat, followed by footsteps in other nearby rooms with an unidentifiable source. He also claimed to hear a female voice calling his name, but could not identify which room it was coming from, because every room he would enter and it would sound like it was coming from somewhere else. We all insisted that we had been downstairs the entire time, and I know we had been. He insisted it was all a big prank and that we were hiding in different rooms trying to conspire against him. We were not. He also said that out of the corner of his eye he would see movement, but when he turned, nothing would be there. He saw it as you would see a person out of the corner of your eye but not really think about it enough to identify their features. 

Finally, we had collected all the items we wanted and had loaded up the car, and took one last look at the home. It was truly sad to know that this may have been the last time we got to see it. We all got into our respective cars, and as I drove away I turned back at the house. I cannot be sure of it, but I could swear that from the upstairs attic window in the back, I saw the silhouette of a woman wearing a white dress, hair pinned up, turned sideways staring out into the backyard. 

If the house goes down, will she go down with it or will she finally find peace? Or will she find some other way to find us and finally convey her message? 

We all discussed our experiences and no one but me believes the house is haunted. Everyone believes I was imagining my experiences in the attic, while my step dad believes we were playing a prank. I know better."
"Cloaked Figures Yelling At Me","Indiana","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I have just moved into Logansport,Indiana. This is the place where my mother and grandfather both grew up. We also moved into the house that they both grew up in, which it has, of course, been fixed up. I have had many other sightings but this is the most recent one and the most terrifying. 

 I am 16 so of course I like to be out at night even just in my backyard. I have recently noticed a figure standing outside of the fence surrounding our yard. My first thought was a person trying to scare me, so I ran into the house and told my mother while grabbing a baseball bat just in case. We both ran out and no one was there. We then went back inside and called the police just in case.

 The next time I saw it was about 2 weeks after that encounter. I was in my room trying to sleep when I turned and saw the cloaked figure standing in the corner, only this time the eyes were a deep red, almost like the shade of blood but glowing lightly.

 I couldn't move once I saw the eyes, I couldn't scream or do anything. Then there was a low whisper that I couldn't make out. And when I asked what it wanted, it responded with ""may god have mercy on your soul"" it was so loud I couldn't bare it and started screaming. No one else heard it but me. 

 That morning I noticed scratches on my stomach in the form of 3 lines. I am still terrified to this day and haven't seen it again (this is now 3 weeks after the incident). But I have noticed my mood has never been the same. And I constantly feel as if I'm being followed. 

 I have been seeing others more recently. When I see someone and tell my mother about it she tells me she doesn't know what I'm talking about. I hear the voices of many in my head. I simply cannot escape for I do not believe in priests."
"The Loud Growl","North Carolina","Misc","It was 1980, and I was sixteen years old. I lived in North Carolina on the army base Fort Bragg with my family. I was getting ready to babysit for the White's, a couple that lived about a half a block from me.

I arrived just before dinner and played with Adam, who was eighteen months and Lacy, who was three. Mr. And Mrs. White came down the stairs dressed to the nines and ready to go out.

""If you have any problems the number to the restaurant is here."" he said as he tapped the paper on the refrigerator. 

The rest of the night was uneventful as I fed the kids, and gave them their baths. I read them a story and put them to bed. Once down stairs I settled down to finish the homework that I left for later. I was startled by the sounds of keys in the door. I quickly looked at the clock and began to pack my books.

Then Mr. And Mrs. White came through the door at midnight.

She asked if there were any problems. I told her none.

He gave me my pay plus extra for staying late. Handing me a fifty he said he would watch me from the door. As I started for home, the air got cold so I pulled my coat tighter around me. Most of the houses on my side were one foot away from the woods out back. I could hear the wind pick up blowing through the trees. I tried not to think about.

The next thing I hear is a loud growl, right next to my ear. I gasped and whipped around but I saw nothing. I mean I could see Mr. White in the doorway of his house. But I saw nothing else around me at all.

I turned towards home walking faster. When the growl came again, my blood felt like it froze. I didn't dare turn around, I was to terrified. I didn't want to see what it was. I began to run and didn't stop until I hit the front door. I quickly slipped

In and locked the door. As I leaned against the door breathing hard, I waited for whatever it was to follow, but nothing happened. 

With a shaking hand I move the curtain just a little and peeked outside, but I saw nothing. I went upstairs, hid under the covers and cried most of the night. I never told my family about what happened. To this day it still affects me greatly."
"Something At The Nursing Home","South Carolina","Haunted Places","I used to work 3rd shift at a small 44 bed nursing home. We were supposed to be an assisted living facility for people who were cognizant yet unable to live on their own and a rehabilitation center for those recovering from surgery or stroke. In reality we were mainly taking care of elderly residents with alzheimer's and dementia. Needless to say people passed away there.

My duties were fairly simple: come in, see to any residents who weren't already in bed, check the ones who were in bed and then make rounds every two hours to make sure everyone was clean and still breathing.

It's almost been seven years since I worked there so I don't remember the order in which these events happened so I'm just going to list them by order of 'severity':

Every so often I would come into work super tired from staying up too late, so after each of my rounds I would set my phone alarm for an hour and a half and take a nap in one of the recliners. Next thing I knew there's a loud *WHAP!*, like someone dropping a heavy, hardback book on the floor, but right next to my ear causing me to jump up awake. I would look around and see that no-one was there before rushing down the hall to check to see if my residents were alright, which they were. After that I'd start my round. This happened at least two times that I remember and always woke me up 1-2 minutes before my alarm was supposed to go off.

The second wasn't really an event, per se, it was just something one of the residents said to me that kind of creeped me out:

One night when I put of my residents, a sweet old lady named Mrs. Lindsey, to bed she looked at me with a smile and said ""you have the most beautiful angel watching over you (or behind you, I can't really remember exactly)."" Mrs. Lindsey did have dementia but she was cognizant enough to recognize people and sometimes circumstances that happen around her, so hearing her say something like that was more than a little creepy.

Lastly is one that still gives me chills and makes me a little paranoid just thinking about it even today:

 Most of the rooms were just rectangles with one bed on each end, a wardrobe at the foot of each bed for resident's clothing and a small end table beside the bed for smaller effects and our gloves and wipes. There are windows on the wall opposite the door from the hall. I was in the middle of one of my rounds when I entered one of the rooms to check on the residents and as I was digging through the end table looking for gloves I started to feel the muscles in my neck, shoulders and back start to tense up. It felt like a weight had just settled across my shoulders. What's more it felt like there was something huge directly behind me. By huge I mean *at least* 8' because I'm 6' and whatever this was felt like it was standing over me looking down. I couldn't move, I could hardly blink, all I could do was stare straight ahead at the windows. The only thing I could think was ""ohcrapohcrapohcrap"". Then, as suddenly as it had started, it was gone and I could move again. When I turned around all that was behind me was a geri-chair and wheelchair. I don't know how long the feeling lasted and didn't think to check the time. It felt like an hour, but couldn't have been more than a few minutes.

I don't remember if there were any sounds or anything like that, just a huge, imposing pressure right behind me. As for my policy on determining what I was thinking about beforehand: I was essentially on ""autopilot mode"", my body was working while my brain was basically off, so I wasn't thinking about anything. When this happened it snapped me fully alert and aware. This is the reason I never keep my back to any opening for longer than I have to as I don't like the idea of something like that coming up behind me again.

The funny thing is is that the room I was in at the time was Mrs. Lindsey's. For some reason I didn't realize that until just a few months ago, though I'm pretty sure it doesn't correlate with what she said. Nothing about that encounter seemed very 'angelic' to me."
"Spirit Guardian To Teen","Louisiana","Misc","I grew up in Coushatta. I was around 12 or 13 when I first sensed the presence of a small girl. I told my brother about her and he told me that he had seen an apparition that looked like what I described. I never saw her but she stayed with me the entire time I lived in this house. I do not believe she was attached to the house. She told me her name was Irma. She was a young girl. She did move things in the house and would get upset if you spoke about her in a bad way. She stayed with me until I got married. 

My next experience was after my husband and I moved into a home close to a house noted to be haunted. One night he went over and brought a board that he wanted to use for a train table from that house. After he did this, things began to happen. Our dog became afraid to go down the hall by herself. I would have to go and ask the spirit to let her go down the hall and then she would go on to our bedroom. The Tv would come on by itself and I always had a sense that someone was there.

After my husband became a firefighter, I would tell him when there would be a fire. Within three days there would be a fire. One night I was working on a jacket for him and suddenly leaned violently to the left. Just then the alarm went off and the phone rang. He was hesitant to go but I told him that I was not sure what it was and he decided to go. As soon as he left I knew he was in trouble and tried to stop him but he was already gone. I waited for hours panicking. Finally, the phone rang and it was another firefighter telling me that he was okay. I asked to talk to him and he told me that he had hit a washout and that the truck had turned over on its left side. The same side I had leaned so violently to before.

My mother has always been able to sense things but she does not like the way she feels. I have always tried to embrace my gift (as small as it is). I have never worked with my gift to try to hone it better. I have a friend that was a witch and she has told me a lot about the gift I have.

I have always been interested in the paranormal and even tried to contact a spirit on an Ouija board. I ended up being threatened by some evil force and I never tried one again.

 I have had experiences with the paranormal all my life. I am interested in trying to hone my gift and would like to join a group on a hunt. I am a criminal justice major. I am in my second year of college online. I am very interested in getting with a group to go on hunts to help those that are plagued with evil. I realize that this is not a game. I take this very seriously. Please consider me when you are close to where I live. I would love to be invited on a hunt. I would like to see if this is what I want to do for a living.

Thank you,

Chey"
"My Friend's Message?","Ohio","Family / Friends Visits","This just happened to me last night. (3/25/19) I thought it strange and wanted to share to get your impressions. (I'll explain my thinking at the end.) 

A little over 40 years ago, I met a little girl on the playground at school. We were both 8 years old. She was new to the school and I was one of those kids that would rather play on the swings alone than be in a group of kids. She and I became fast friends. Before you knew it, we were best friends doing everything together. Even as adults we were very close. Our kids are all close in age too.

2 1/2 years ago, she was diagnosed with cancer and not given much time. We were still quite close (except for the miles between us) but, as happens in life, we had an argument or two. As time went on, we would talk here and there, but her cancer progressed and she passed away a few weeks ago. Luckily for me, we were able to make amends first. 

Anyway, last night I was really missing her and was talking to her. My husband was downstairs listening to the stereo. I was apologizing to her for not standing up at her funeral and saying a few words (I have social anxiety and can't get up in front of a group of people.) I apologized for not being by her side as much as I wanted to or felt I should have. And on and on I'm sure you get the picture. I asked her before closing my eyes to come talk to me in my dreams just so I could know she's OK. As I laid my head down and closed my eyes I heard the song ""Thank you for being a friend"" (Theme song from ""The Golden Girls) come on the stereo from downstairs. 

I am not sure what all of you will say this is. One part of me truly wants to believe it was her telling me it's OK. But the other part of me says it was just a total coincidence that this particular song played right then. I am tending to believe the latter although I would like someone to convince me it was the former.

Thanks for any input."
"Strange Things Are Happening In My Boarding School","Pennsylvania","Haunted Places","I usually talk about my experiences in my old boarding school in Indonesia, but this time I will be talking about my experience in my new boarding school in PA. 

 I started attending an Islamic boarding school in PA in August. Of course, for privacy reasons I will not be telling the name of the school since I still attend that school. I've been staying in this boarding school for almost 8 months and I haven't experienced anything until a couple of days ago. These experiences are not very scary but more strange.

The first encounter was at bed time. My friend S was downstairs but my other friend and I saw her upstairs at the same time. We saw her tucking herself in and my other friend actually talked to her. While ""S"" was settling into bed, the real S walked into the room at the same time. Then the S that was tucking herself in disappeared. It was so strange! I'm sorry if this doesn't make sense because I don't really know how to describe that moment but trust me it was so strange.

Another encounter was when I was cleaning the downstairs bathroom. So, the layout of the bathroom is kind of weird. There is door and when you walk in there is a little hallway. If you go straight there is another door which leads to a toilet with a single sink. If you go straight for probably 6 or 7 steps then turn left and about 1 or 2 steps ahead there is a room with no door on your right with 3 sinks and 3 mirrors. If you continue to go straight from there there is another room with just 1 toilet. I'm sorry if this is hard to understand because it's hard for me to explain it too. So, in the room with the 3 mirrors and sinks there are 3 mats for every sink. I straightened out the mats and cleaned the sinks and mirrors then I went into the room with a toilet and sink to clean in there. Then I realized that I left the paper towels in the other room. When I came back the mats were all messed up again. I didn't even leave the room for more than a minute. No one else came in and if they did I would've seen them because they would have to pass me first to get in there. At first I thought maybe I kicked it by accident and didn't think anything of it. Then went back to the room with 1 toilet and sink and started cleaning. When I clean the toilets I don't close the door because I get paranoid that the lights would turn off since the light switch is on the outside. Then I went back into the room with 3 mirrors and sinks to turn off the lights but guess what? The mats were messed up again. This time I knew that I didn't mess them up by accident and no one else came in because if they did I would've seen them since I left the door open. I was super annoyed and angry.

Those are the only strange things that have happened so far but if something else happens I'll keep you updated."
"Creature In My Hotel Room","Tennessee","Non Human Entities","This story happens exactly one week after my first story which I posted this morning. It may be connected because it contains a similar creature as the second creature that I encountered in Dad's house on the day that I left. But as I reported in the previous story, it was difficult to identify more than the outline of the second creature at Dads house. Go find that story if you want more on that. This creature however, had a very different demeanor then that one.

After I left my father's house, I went on a vacation to Tennessee. At this point, I was in Memphis, in a hotel room on a high floor where my shepherd (who was with me) was taking a keen interest on the activities outside the window. Not on the ground below the window that is, she was looking *straight out*. I had my curtains open because the lights were fluorescent and I'm a migraineur and was opting not to have crushing head pain that night. The front desk would not initially provide me additional towels to cover the shades at check in, leaving the sodium halide or whatever-they-are road lights as my room lighting. I feel like I need to explain this because who leaves their curtains open, right? Anyway, after initially thinking that the dog was looking at traffic, it occurred to me that she's much smarter than that. I started to feel uneasy, closed the curtains, noticed the dog looking around the edges, called her away and phoned the front desk to ask again for some extra towels for the lamps. The dog and I settled in for some tv and then bed.

The creature showed up in the middle of the room the next day, a Sunday at 4:30am. I was woken but groggy when my dog jumped off the bed and walked ¾ of the way around it, sniffing it. It raised its muscular hand, turned outward and hooked it in the air above my big shepherd. This seemed to make my shepherd lay down on her belly right there next to the beast. As I woke, and before it noticed me, I was lying on my side facing the center of the room where it stood. At first, I thought I had an intruder and then it occurred to me that the door was deadbolted. After that thought, it became invisible, surprising me, and then visible again in exactly the same spot, (ostensibly?) a little angry that I had witnessed all of this. 

This creature looked like a short burly man with a long torso and short dark, possibly furry legs. I did not get a good look at the legs. He was very muscular, about 4'-6"" tall but you could have put his torso on a 6' man and it would have been proportional. He had dark, curly hair and a dark, curly, medium length beard shaped to a point. He also had what looked like something poking out above his head toward his face, either ears or small horns. This is the best I could make out since the room at this time was just lit from a light from the bathroom, so he was strictly backlit and lit with reflected light to my eye. By any measure, I'd say it looked like a satyr but until this day thought these to be strictly members of the fantasy realm. 

So what is a demon to do when it's mad? If there are demon phones, the word is out that chucking a fit doesn't get much traction with me in the moment (reference first post). So this one... Tries to kill me? While one hand was over my dog (and she wasn't moving) he pointed two fingers at me and suddenly my heart started racing like I was finishing out a stress test. Part of me was afraid and part of me was impressed that he could throw energy around like that while having some confidence that I'm a poor candidate for this particular attack. I thought to myself ""he's not going to have any luck with this."" And then I rolled flat on my back, crossed my arms over my chest and started softly singing hymns because I didn't want him reading any other thoughts. This went on for at least five minutes- what seemed forever and then he just gave up and left. I haven't seen that guy since. Anyone know who he was or why he stalked my room? What is the best tactic to take when dealing with hostiles? I feel like I was lucky in this case but now I've met (at least) two hostile demons and am concerned the next one could be worse.

I've been to the doctor since and my heart rate and pulse are still very slow."
"Christmas At Dad's","Wisconsin","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","My dad is 80 years old. He doesn't live in his house, but instead lives with his girlfriend in a one story house approximately 3 miles from his. When I visit at Christmas, I normally stay at his house because his girlfriend's dog is unnecessarily fearful of my big shepherd. This story takes place between December 24 2018 and mid January 2019.

The house felt unusually strange for no visible or palpable reason. I thought that unoccupied houses are this way and then spied a little brown bat hanging off the stairs to the second floor. (Firstly, gross. How did that get in there?) It looked gaunt but I couldn't tell if it were living or dead. I stepped around it because I an *not* messing with anything that can carry a zoonotic disease.

The next night, there was a lot of banging around, walking, and dragging sounds coming from the attic. The attic is just storage and it's really difficult to get to, or rather, impossible without a ladder and can only be accessed though the house. I've looked for that ladder and don't know where it is. I meet my dad and brother for Christmas dinner (girlfriend is sick) and apprise them of the bat and Ghouly McChains, which they found very funny apart from the bat. Dad later removed the bat himself after it had not moved for several days.

In the following evenings, I start feeling this buzzing feeling, usually on my arms and legs and eventually other places. Of course, at this point, I had not read your posts on succubi so I didn't know what it was at that time. It showed at night, I could be walking around or in bed and would leave if I just covered up my lady parts with my hands. However, get this- it harassed my dog! When I saw my elderly female hump her new toy- a behavior she hasn't done in years and never to toys- I had an inkling that something was definitely afoot.

Meanwhile, every time I would open the door to the basement, my dog would want to run down there. She has never had any interest in the basement in the past. But this visit, like everything else, it's all different. Upon opening, She would sprint for the furnace and run a loop around a huge old table meant to hold a model railroad but instead just hosting stacks of crushed dreams, lost languages and last century's artifacts. It's dusty and full of webs making it all the more frustrating when she wouldn't get out of there until she was ""good and ready"". (dog thinking) 

So all of this came to a head one morning, around 6am, a time that I'm not normally awake. Lying on my side and facing the door to the bedroom, I had just my bottom eye cracked open. I noticed the bedroom door swing from cracked to open and immediately registered that there is *no wind* in that winter-sealed house and thus, something was going down right then. A short blur whisked around the door and hovered over/ occupied the same floor space where I had stacked drawings behind the door. This was the first time I'd seen her. She didn't look entirely human. Her face was as if it had been in a car accident and her hair was cartoonish. I didn't see her legs or feet. Then she zoomed about 1 foot off the floor towards me, still not knowing that I was awake and brushed against my forearm, which was just outside the covers. There was that familiar buzz. I yawned and pulled my arm beneath the blankets. I thought I had foiled her.

She returned approximately 5 or 10 minutes later and I felt her trying to put her tendril-like fingers beneath the covers. I slammed my opposing hand down tight because THE JIG WAS UP. She jumped over my head to the opposite side of the bed. I looked straight at her and (opting to be visible) she stuck her tongue out at me. I asked her to please go away and to leave that house. She then touched my head.

Now, apparently (per my experience) their ""power"" works this way. When a succubus touches you, blood rushes to that spot of your body. I'm a migraineur. It will not do for me to have these things touching my head. I asked her to quit and instead she wrapped her body around my head. So I threw her off as best as I could, which worked, while saying some cross things and then *somebody* (maybe her?) chucked a fit and stomped loudly around the house for the next two hours. Seriously, it sounded like a bipedal buffalo was ascending the stairs.

I lain in bed while chaos reigned and then it was quiet for an hour. I got up at 9:30 when I thought it more likely that the sun was far enough up and there would be no more confrontation that day. I made breakfast and heard rustling in the den. Again, winter in Wisconsin- windows are closed. I grabbed the dog, opened the doors and see this shadow creature zipping around the room. This is NOT the same thing from earlier that day and it was either afraid of me or the dog or both. I couldn't make out what it was because it was moving as fast as a mouse. It was about 3 1/2-4' tall, running on two rear legs and was leaning forward. My closest guess at that time was that it looked like a small goat-man satyr but I didn't think about it much. I opened the back door and told it to leave and that if it did, we wouldn't hurt it. I have no idea if it left because I didn't see it anymore and my dog didn't seem to find it. She saw it when I did.

This house somehow got this way in the past year. I don't understand how. I typically only visit at Christmas and it's not possible to do a cleaning/ protection then. I packed my belongings and got out of there that morning and won't return until I understand what I'm dealing with and what I can safely do about it. Thanks to this site, I have already discovered that creature 1 isn't a poltergeist, as I had initially thought and as for the rest, it's anyone's guess."
"The Ghost Principal","South Carolina","Haunted Places","In 2013 I was in 7th grade, I was in the band for Ware Shoals Junior High. We had a winter concert coming up and one day in early December, my band director sent me and my friend Lee to a small room above the auditorium to grab a few extra stands and music books. The idea of doing that terrified me as the school had more than one ghost story about the auditorium and that room in particular.

 When the school was first created we had a female principal, who's name had been lost in history. One night after everyone had gone home, she stayed to complete paperwork and was attacked by someone who had broken in, getting pushed over the banister and her neck broken on impact. After that happened she haunted that part of the school, including the auditorium and all of the rooms near it. 

I believed that story completely, having no reason not to. Lee and I made our way to the room, Lee staying on the steps to wait for me as I went in, since she had problems with her legs and couldn't quite walk up the stairs completely. As soon as I walked into the room the temperature seemed to drop, chilling me even through the thick jacket I wore. I shook it off at first as it just being an old building, but then the door slammed shut behind me as I picked up two of the stands nearby. I turned and called out to Lee, and from her voice I could tell she was still on the steps, and I would have heard her running up and down them. I turned back around and grabbed a third stand, stopping when I felt someone's eyes on me. I turned back around and saw some dark shape staring at me, blocking the door and preventing me from leaving. A chilling voice came out and asked me why I was here so late, and I couldn't reply as my voice had somehow stopped working. The shape walked towards me, getting clearer with each step. It had brown hair pulled into a bun, its neck twisted abnormally and its eyes a burning red black. It yelled for me to get out, and I threw a stand at it, running out of the room and grabbing Lee on my way out. We made it back to the band room and I went into the director's office, telling her everything I saw and heard. She was silent for a moment before shaking her head and looking at me. She informed me that Lee and I weren't allowed to go the auditorium alone anymore, and I nodded. 

A few days later we had our concert, and through the whole thing I could see the shape staring at me, almost as if she was waiting for me to get off stage.

Let's just say I never went into the auditorium without at least 3 other people again."
"The Easter Bunny","Michigan","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","Before I get started this happened a long time ago. I'm almost 20 and this happened when I was 5 or 6. At that age I didn't know anything about ghosts, and I don't know if this was a ghost, but I can tell you I wasn't hallucinating.

 I'll give you a basic description of my house, my bedroom is the farthest room in the house, if you walk out of my room there is a hallway that leads to the dining room, there are a few rooms on both sides, my mom's room is right next to mine, then a guest room, and then my bathroom. (So keep this in mind) 

On Easter morning right around 4 in the morning I woke up, it was normal for me because I would have to use the bathroom. I didn't sleep with my door closed at the time so it was open, I never liked to use my bathroom because it was too far away from my room (I'm scared of the dark) but that night I wanted to use my bathroom. 

I walk to my door way and look down the hallway and into the dining room and you know how little kids take pictures with the life size Easter bunny, yea there was one in my dining room. Like this thing was huge, and being a little kid this was scary. The lights weren't on, and I didn't want to turn them on, being a little kid things went through my mind like: what if I'll get killed, or what if I won't get my basket. I decided not to go to my bathroom, and I went to my mom's. My mom was in her bed trust me I checked, I stayed in her room for 5 minutes and when I went out to go back to my room it was gone. 

No ones believes me when I tell them this story and it makes me it upset because it's very true. Please let me know if this has happened to you!"
"Pizza Hut Ghost","New York","Haunted Places","I mentioned in one of my previous stories that I am a delivery driver for a Pizza Hut in NY. Today I am going to tell you of the experiences I have had while working in the restaurant. These are short, quick encounters with sentence long stories. 

Lights throughout the store will flicker at random times. Sometimes weeks will go by and nothing happens, then it will start happening again. There has been a couple times that I have seen a shadow moving, the first time I saw it go through two walls, and the second time I thought someone went to the back, only to go back there and find no one there, and all my co workers were up front.

 I also once heard a woman's voice say ""hello?"" right before we were about to leave.

 My manager once said that a stack of plates seemed to rise up and back down like a slinky, but without any sound. 

But one major thing that happens is when me and other co workers are on break, I will be sitting in my car and sometimes I will hear what sounds like little stones hitting the back window, and to my annoyance, there's no one around. I mentioned this once to a co worker and she said that just that night it sounded like someone was throwing snowballs on her car. Once, one of my co workers went one break, then we got a phone call, and it was that co worker, freaking out, telling us to come outside and get her because she heard knocks on the car door that she was sitting in, and there was no one there.

I guess that's all for now, hoping to post more things in the near future."
"The World Paused","Texas","Family / Friends Visits","This is my 2nd story of 4 weird events that have happened to me in 51 years of life so far. After posting my last story, many readers wondered why I don't want to respond to comments or questions. Answer is I have talked about my strange events with others so many times over the years and I am a very busy man. I just want tell you my crazy true stories because I think they need to be heard. 

 This event took place while at work one day 17 years ago. I was the manager of an extremely busy paint store with 8 full time employees serving many contractors, homeowners, and decorators. What I mean by very busy is, at 7 am every morning there are van loads of contractors and workers waiting for us to unlock the doors and be first to order supplies for the day. Controlled chaos for most of the day is a good way to look at it. So this day was the same as every other day at work, BUSY.

 It was probably 8 am and I had just taken a order from a contractor at the front counter and had to go in the warehouse to fill the order. I pushed the swinging warehouse door open and walked a few steps into the warehouse then the phone rang. I looked around and all my employees were busy tinting, mixing, loading, pulling orders, etc, and there lots of contractors and crews waiting for their paint to be mixed or pulled from inventory. Every 1 gallon and 5 gallon paint mixer was on and everyone talking while waiting made it extremely noisy in the warehouse. After noticing I was closest to the phone I turned around and went back to the front counter to answer the phone.

 I answered it but nobody was on the line so I hung up and pushed swinging door open to the warehouse and took a couple steps in and looked around in amazement. Everything and everyone stopped as if someone had a remote control and pressed the pause button. I just stood there looking from right to left at everybody and they weren't frozen stiff in action but more like paused and relaxed looking at the ground in front of them during this moment of silence. All my employees and a bunch of contractors just standing everywhere on pause with no mixers or shakers making noise Complete silence. I still see them breathing but no body movement. The atmosphere felt very peaceful for those 10 seconds of time and just when I was going to say something out loud the phone rang again then BAM the pause button was clicked again and the whole place was turned back on like nothing had ever happened. Machines came on, conversations and work continued. 

I was speechless as I turned around to go and answer the phone that was ringing at the front counter. I answered and my mother was on the line. She says hi this is mom and I replied 'I Know' she says 'What---I know you are busy but I just wanted to tell you your grandmother just passed away'. 

I said ' I know, she was just here'. Mom says 'you're kidding me'. I told her her I wasn't and I would tell her about it she gets back in town. She was up in Cleveland Ohio with her mother my grandmother, at the hospital and we all pretty much knew that she probably wasn't going to make this time, so I knew as soon as I heard my mom's voice calling me at work that time of the morning what had just happened to me in the warehouse. Grandma put my world on pause when she came to say goodbye to me."
"He Doesn't Like Me","Nebraska","Haunted Places","I am a cable installer and I work in all sorts of buildings old and new alike. I am also a medium. I have recently been working a building that was built in the 1920's, the foundation was laid in 1918 by a freemason.

 Anyway, I was in the basement of the building and there are three walking spaces under the building one is the biggest of the three and has a tunnel in it that leads to an old crematorium. 

Well in each of these walking spaces there at least two or three ghosts. In the tunnel space there is a crying woman and a demon as well as a little girl. I have seen all three of these entities and I have been scratched by the demon for protecting some of my co workers. 

In the medium size walk space there is an evil spirit it is a male and he does not like me at all. He has choked me and is constantly trying to trip me when I go up the stairs to the ground level and tries pushing me down the stairs when I have to go down to the basement. He has told me that it is because a woman should never work in a man's job. That I am a disgusting disgrace to all women. Now I am completely straight he just hates me for working in a man's job as a cable installer. I do not want to go back to that building I hate it but I need to so I can pay my bills and provide for my son. 

There is a little girl who has told me she died from being sick. I think she means tuberculosis. She is always hugging me and she follows me around. She hides behind me whenever I am around my co-workers. 

The crying lady has been asking me for help but I do not know how to help her. She seems so sad and there is a little boy who is super shy. I still hate the building regardless."
"Many Many Deer, Why?","Massachusetts","Haunted Places","My husband and I have always enjoyed nature. We feed the birds in our yard, and yes the black bear came, likes sneaks in the night. We didn't care, only upset that we didn't see them. Then came the evening a she bear came just when I had put out the kitchen light. ""Bob! Bear! Bear!"" He runs for his camera as I stand where I could touch her, if not for the kitchen window. The sliding door was opened slowly, click, click, goes the camera and off goes the bear. The fur was so shiny black. Interestingly she left a bad smell behind that only lasted for about thirty seconds.

We were on a route that is very familiar to us, I travel this way for groceries, also many stores for clothing and nice places to dine. A cultural place where several universities blend to the main park.

Not driving myself, I was enjoying the winter wonderland out the side window. Suddenly I saw deer, more than I had ever seen before. The hill beside me had a massive amount of deer, walking slowly on the steep hill, one after the other. Some were female and others had big racks, large pointed horns.

We pulled over, and off the road. They continued to follow the same path. Never had I seen so many at one time. The large buck was leading, there would be young bucks mixing with the doe, and finally the smaller yearlings. We noticed a space between the groups, then the very large Buck and again a similar chain of deer. We watched, unspeaking, hundreds of deer, what is the reason. Perhaps with snow on the ground making food harder to find so they are on the hunt for better eats.

We sat with our engine stopped, as this show passed before us. The view made me think of a much earlier time, thousands of years ago. A prehistoric action, done, just as the packs had done long before.

My husband saw everything with me, we took many pictures with my phone and the digital my husband had in the car, and not one came out. There was a fuzzy area, where there should have been deer. Until I saw the fuzzy pictures I gave no thought to the paranormal. I still think what we have seen is real. My husband has almost never been a part of anything paranormal, and he never questioned as to what we visualized as to not being real. Is this a replay of the past or did we see a reality moment. If this is real, where did they come from, and why?

Thank you for reading, do you have any ideas?"
"Getting My Faith Back","Pennsylvania","Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms","I have gone through 40 years of my life without having a paranormal incident. This includes camping, staying in old houses, staying in supposed haunted houses and all the things a person does either knowingly or not while growing up. But having several, 2 of which I posted here, over the course of a 6 year period is a bit much. My wife who has a very strong faith, attending Mass, saying the Rosary every night, has a better and stronger relationship with the almighty. I sadly have work in that area. Point is she instructed me in getting ""right"" in my faith. I think the last couple of month's activity convinced her. Things I have learned to live with or ignore. Whispering in your ears during the night, noises from empty bedrooms, falling boxes in rooms can all be explained.

 I was at work one day a few months ago when I got called to the phone by a very irate wife. Why were you downstairs screaming my name and and not answering? I assured her I had not left. It took my boss telling her I had not left for her to believe me. I told her it was a dream. But when she said she was at the top of the stairs yelling back down, she was not dreaming. I got home and she said I know it was your voice, after years of marriage I know my own husband's voice.

 Other things started happening to her that was happening to me and would always make excuses for without her knowledge. I soon found out that is classic activity I did not want; there was a lot and in particular a high level demon or possibly even a devil at the cause of this. My voice being reproduced, missing items, Holy objects that are blessed and messed with were all a giant calling card. 

Then her Rosary started getting screwed with, again.

Every night for a week her Rosary would be tangled. It is a special one as she has M.S. And it is made for her because of the disease. But she often falls asleep during or right after her prayers and I told her it falling into the bedding could knot the beads. Every night I would take from 5 to 30 minutes to untangle them. What I did not know was she was placing them on her nightstand for a few nights. Combine that with being awoken to whistling in my ear so loud it woke me up, only to find I was alone, my wife had left for work scared me, as it was in the same room!

 That night a wooden set of Rosary beads hanging on my chair would swing to a degree you could hear them knock of the wooden chair they hung on. I suppose the house settling is causing that right? I could not argue her point. I always thought that as long as you believed in Christ and tried to be a good person he did not care whether you were praying in a Church, playground or fishing. I still kind of think that in a way. But my wife is a forgiving person who despite her health always seems a bit happier and less negative than I. I wanted that. I started going to mass with her. I learned many things. The Catholic church had changed. No prayer to Saint Michael, no latin, and very hard to get an audience with a priest especially if you are a ""newbie"".

 I had the luck of befriending via social media 2 people who work for the church although a distant parish. They investigate for their church and I did verify their employment at their urging. There diocese contacted local clergy who actually contacted me for counseling and a blessing. I was amazed. After trying for weeks I had my meeting. Between the sources of the demonologist and priest who both said the same thing I was ashamed. Due to my faith which was weak, my wife being much more pious, she was the target of this not I. I was no threat, ripe for the picking I think the exact words were. The fact that I work in a long term care center which is often the source of pain, death, unhappiness and anger often draw demons like hospitals often do. The fact that for the 2nd time rosary beads were desecrated worried us all. There was no pretense to this demon. It was a very high level and proud one. After a house blessing and a brief cleansing service by the priest he informed me it was up to us to keep our house in order.

 Good news is that all is normal, and I have found my faith again. I am just sorry it had to come to this. I am striving to be more like my wife. We say the rosary because she told me Jesus listens to his Mom, she never prays for herself despite her destined for a walker/wheelchair in the near future. There is always somebody worse off. M.S. Is a burden God knows I can manage.

 She leaves me speechless. Bad news too, although the parish where my friends work is prepared for such things many churches, despite religions are not.

 My point in posting this less then scary story is this, despite what you are going through and your belief system, you are always watched over, help comes from unexpected places, and as much as you might not want to accept it like I, you might want to consider thinking outside the box. If you dismiss or make excuses for things that have no explanation, you might be not be looking in the right spot for a reason. After all I have been through I would be happy to share signs of oppression, infestation, or whether you have to worry I would be happy to answer your questions. They are all church ordained, from what I have learned from the priest and church sanctioned demonologist. If You have a question ask. I am an unwilling source of info. And as I have found out computer data is highly unreliable..."
"Ghosts In The G.i. Lab","South Carolina","Haunted Places","Since this is my first story on here I want to give a little info about myself for better understanding of my state of mind during any events I describe: I've always been interested in the supernatural/paranormal for as long as I can remember. It's always been a fascinating subject for me and I constantly read ghost stories and watch videos on YouTube with a hope of some definitive proof that there are such things as ghosts/aliens/etc. However, there is a large part of me that is incredibly skeptical and despite multiple occurrences I still cannot fully embrace the idea of the supernatural being a real thing. This is because I have a very overactive imagination. Even at the age of 35 I can easily psych myself out by thinking too much on certain topics, so I have to be careful in determining if my reaction is one of an imagination run rampant or if I am truly experiencing a phenomenon. Any feelings I have that may be caused by the paranormal starts with my arms tingling, then my scalp/back of neck will tingle and sometimes there's a hollow sensation in the pit of my stomach, however, most of these feelings (arms/scalp tingling) can happen too when I get excited by something, so again I have to be aware of what I was doing/thinking at the time and not write it off as paranormal every time it happens. That being said: I WANT to believe.

These are the most recent events that have happened. I figured I'd start with these and work my way back to earlier ones.

I work 3rd shift at a relatively small hospital doing floor maintenance (stripping, waxing, scrubbing and buffing). I have one coworker 'Wade' and we essentially do the floors for the entire hospital. Normally we work together but our days off are alternating so there's at least one of us working on any given night. Usually our solo nights are the times we designate to scrub and buff all the main halls and lobbies and when we're together we do the waxing, so this night I was scrubbing (as I am when all these occurrences happen) and always in the area of the Gastrointestinal (G.I.) Lab and Recovery. I'll try my best to describe the layout for better understanding. (I apologize in advance for spelling out each area, but usually whenever I talk to someone who doesn't work in a hospital they always ask what something means when I refer to an area using shorthand terminology which has become rote habit, so I figured it'd save me some potential questioning later.) 

I always start on the second floor where the G.I. Lab and Recovery units are and work my way down to the ground floor where we put the machines when I'm done. When you step off the employee elevators onto the second floor to the right is the single set of doors to the Medical/Surgical (Med/Surg) unit and to the left there are three sets of doors: on the left leads to the second floor sitting area and visitor elevators, to the right is Sterile Processing for surgical equipment and straight ahead leads to the outer G.I. Lab hall. Going through those doors into the hall there's two G.I. Operating Suites on the right, on the left is the doors to the G.I. Observation unit and straight is a set of doors that leads to a long hall with the Operating Rooms (O.R.) to the right, Recovery to the left and Labor and Delivery (L&D) at the end. The G.I. Observation unit is like a sideways ""U"" with doors at each end that enter into Recovery and the rooms around the edges with the nurses station in the middle area. There's a small door that leads out to the sitting area on the opposite side of the unit from the double doors of the outer G.I. Hall. All the doors are electronic and require a badge to open going into the units and a button when exiting except the doors that lead back out to the elevator landing, it opens automatically when you approach from the G.I. Side.

Whenever I'm in the G.I./Recovery area while scrubbing I usually have feelings of being watched (which I usually just chalk up to the aforementioned imagination) and occasionally will hear fixtures rattling. My coworker believes there is the ghost of a little boy in that area and that he likes to play with the bathroom light and room fixtures. I've had the bathroom light come on randomly while I'm working (it has a motion sensor switch, so I'm not certain it isn't just my shadow or reflection in the mirror setting it off). 

There have only been three experiences so far that I can't easily explain: the first happened the middle of last year when I was scrubbing the outer G.I. Hall and with every pass the automatic doors to the elevator landing opened and then closed when I was on the far end. Except when I was done. I finished up and was heading for the doors when they suddenly wouldn't open. Thinking that I had tripped the sensor that keeps the doors from opening if someone is too close, I backed up to try again. No luck. I even hit the button used for such an occasion and still nothing. Getting a little frustrated I muttered ""seriously?!"" and immediately the doors opened. 

The second time was around October last year and I had just gotten started sweeping in the G.I. Observation area before I could scrub when I started feeling very uncomfortable and uneasy and my arms/scalp started tingling with the hollow pit in the stomach coming on. This is usually when I have to evaluate what I was thinking about beforehand to determine if I was just hyping myself up. I realized that I wasn't thinking about anything in general, just wanting to get done with work. The feeling kept getting stronger and I felt like I really didn't want to be in there so I went out the outer hall to get the scrubber. When I turned to start scrubbing I heard the small door to the sitting area start rattling pretty hard. At first I thought it was security messing with me, because we prank each other all the time, when I realized that the sound was moving around the unit to all the outer doors. Then all the sensors above them started clicking rapidly for a few seconds before stopping and silence. I was more than a little freaked and I didn't scrub that area, but decided that I at least needed to do the outer hall.

 I was still feeling the tingling feelings, but the uneasy, hollow feeling was fading. I started scrubbing and after the first pass of the automatic doors (they opened normally this time) I made my way to the other end and as I was rounding that end I looked in the direction of the closing doors and saw a flash of a yellow/white light go past the small windows in the doors going in the direction of the sitting area. I tried to reason that it was a reflection in the window, but the doors were closing to slow for how fast the light went by and there wasn't a bright enough light in that area to reflect something that clearly. Add to that the fact that the tingly feeling intensified almost tenfold. My scalp tingled so hard I thought my hair was going to spontaneously combust. Again I tried to rationalize that I was just getting overly excited after what had happened earlier, but that didn't explain why the feeling almost immediately faded after I got on the elevator and went down to the first floor.

The last event happened just the other day. One of our other duties is to gather all the trash from the cans around the outside of the hospital and in the lobby/waiting areas. I was in the second floor sitting area outside G.I./Recovery emptying the can right beside the small door to G.I. Observation, I had my back to the visitor elevators, when it felt like someone was coming up behind me. It was the feeling you get when there's someone standing directly next to you, but it started off like it was at a distance and was moving closer/getting stronger. I turned around and no-one was there. Generally I tend to keep my back turned towards a wall at all times (due to an incident at my last job that I plan on posting about sometime), but figured I wasn't going to be there long and I guess I dropped my guard. There was no tingling feeling, but a little bit of the hollow stomach feeling.

Sorry for the long post and if this is an indecipherable mess, I have trouble articulating my thoughts into text on a large scale like this."
"The Lady In The Glass Case","New York","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","""The myths about the Galloway ""Lady in the Glass Case"" memorial in Lake View Cemetery in Jamestown grow bigger with each passing generation. Speculation ranges from the untimely death of a young bride, to the '50s version of the untimely death on a prom date, to a forbidden love between a rich heiress and her chauffeur.

Some embellish the tale with reports that she roams the cemetery on dark and foggy nights, crying for her lost love. The more creative version is that the body of the young woman is encased within the statue itself.

Grace Laverne Galloway was the only daughter of three children born to a wealthy family. Her father, John Galloway, had made his fortune in oil in Titusville, Pa. They lived in a mansion that is now the Moose Club in Jamestown. Because she was a promising opera singer who frequently appeared at Chautauqua Institution, her family chose to send her to a Boston institute to study music. She was a young woman with career aspirations and little time for romance.

Although she was said to be very friendly, outgoing and generous with her time and money for charitable work, the fact is, to the best of Elizabeth Smith's knowledge, Grace Galloway was never seriously involved with anyone before her death at the young age of 26. When she died in 1898, it was from a case of tuberculosis contracted during her stay in Boston, not from a broken heart.

Her parents eager to find a cure, had sent her to North Carolina in the hope that she would recover. She died a year later in Pittsburgh, on her way back from a visit home. All of the Galloway money could not buy the life of their only daughter, Grace.

Later, the family commissioned an artist in Italy to sculpt a statue, modeled after the likeness of Grace, in a dress they had chosen at random. It was a monument to be built in living memory. The rest of the monument was constructed by John Galloway and his father.

When it became evident that the statue would eventually be destroyed by the elements, it was encased in glass.

The life size glass enclosed statue of a young woman in Lake View Cemetery attracts attention of thousands of persons each year... And many stories, most of them untrue, circulate about the young woman.

Grace Galloway died Nov. 2, 1898, at the age of 27. She was taken ill with tuberculosis while studying music in Boston, Mass., and died in less than a year. She had gone south to Asheville, N.C., for her health, and had also been a patient at Saranac, and was returning south when she died in Pittsburgh, Pa. Funeral services were held at the First Baptist Church her and Miss Galloway's favorite hymns were sung.

The Galloway home was what is now the Moose Club Home at Fifth and Liberty Streets. John Galloway, father of Grace Galloway, had seen a monument in a Buffalo cemetery which impressed him and gave him the idea for the monument in Lake View Cemetery... He engaged an artist in Pittsburgh who modeled the figure in clay from Miss Galloway's last portrait. It was sent to Florence, Italy, where it was carved in Italian marble. Miss Galloway's dress was sent along with it so that it could be copied."" (Mason, Cheryl. ""Unveiling The Mystery Of The Lady In Glass In Lakeview Cemetery,"" Jamestown (NY) Post-Journal, 16 August 1997.) 

In 1985, I was an active member in the Moose Lodge in Jamestown, NY. On Thursday evenings I played cards with my brother and other friends at the lodge. We usually played in the dining room on the first floor, but when we had less players, we would play in the basement. On one particular night I arrived and went directly to the dining room to meet my friends, only to find my card friends missing. They were playing in the basement. Earlier I had taken my jacket off and placed it over a chair in the dining room. 

Besides the main stairway from the entrance to the first floor, there was also a back stairway from the dining room to the basement level. Leaving my jacket in the dining room, I proceeded down the back stairs to the basement. We played cards for about three hours until 1:00 am. As everyone started leaving, I remembered my jacket upstairs. Everyone else began leaving through the main entrance/exit. I went up to the dining room, got my jacket and proceeded back down the stairs and on the landing, I came face to face with Grace. We were about two feet from each other.

She just stood there looking at me, barely moving. I said nothing. She appeared to be startled, as was I from our sudden encounter. She was partly transparent white, a little shorter than me and appeared to be calling me to follow her. The area where we were standing became very dry and cold. I wasn't scared and stood there for about thirty seconds, staring at her. I then walked briskly to the main entrance/exit to meet my friends outside. 

I looked at my friends with a totally horrified face and said ""I just saw Grace"", and explained what had just happened.

The building is planned to be razed this spring 2019."
"Spirits Follow Me","Missouri","A Haunted Life","My entire life has been filled with paranormal experiences. The first sign that something was wrong is when I was very young I kept asking my parents if we had ghosts. They would always answer with,"" we bought the house brand new"", so no one had died there. I would try to believe them, but I always had a nagging feeling they were wrong.

When I got a bit older I started having horrible realistic nightmares. They would range all over from childhood nightmares of an evil leprechaun sized dentist who wanted to kill me to flying snakes. Some were not so much childhood imagination.

Nightmare 1: It was my mother's birthday and I had just learned how to read. My grandma had gotten my mom a card and said I should read it to show my mom how good I had gotten. I don't remember what it said but it was hard to read and I botched it horribly. The second I stopped reading it my mom died. My grandma then started laughing as I bawled my eyes out. This one was so vivid I had awoken my dad who coaxed me awake and had to comfort me for at least half an hour. 

Nightmare 2: This one is short, but recurring. Basically a witch was living in the walls of my Grandma's basement.

Nightmare 3: Before I had fallen asleep I was in the playroom watching Blues Clues. I don't know when I had fallen asleep, but I had an awful nightmare that a witch had come out of the closet and tried to attack me.

As you can probably tell there is a recurring theme of a witch, I don't know why and still haven't found out. 

As I grew older and my parents divorced I was switching back and forth every week. I never had any experiences at my mom's and the one's at my Dad's had settled down a lot. Until I moved in with my dad except every other weekend.

It didn't start right away but I still had an uneasy feeling in the house especially in the old play room. One day I had gotten ready for school and was walking down the hall from the bathroom to the living/kitchen area. I didn't realize such a short walk would leave such a long memory. 

As I got to the end of the hall and could see into the kitchen I saw a black shadow in the shape of a man. My dad was at work for another hour or two and it was too tall to be my step mom. There was a lamp at the end of the hall and I was not going to be an idiot and look away and the shadow would be gone. So without looking I tried turning on the lamp. It wouldn't come on. As I'm staring trying to get the dang lamp to turn on, the shadow starts to move. When a person walks there is a bounce. This did not have any bounce; it just glided to the right toward the other hall behind a wall. 

I was frozen in fear for a couple minutes then I finally got the lamp on; nothing was there. I did the typical thing and followed it cautiously and it had just disappeared. I booked it out of the house and just for good measure texted my step mom and asked if she had been in the kitchen. She texted back saying no, my text had awoken her. 

Eventually I had gotten into some trouble and switched arrangements and moved in with my mom and her boyfriend. I figured at least this place isn't going to be haunted. Boy, was I right and wrong. It wasn't I am. 

Nothing happened for a while. Then one night as I'm trying to go to bed and can't because of my mom's boyfriend watching TV too loud. He finally turned it off to go to bed and I started to ease into sleep, facing the wall. Right on the verge of unconsciousness I heard a man yell very clearly ""wake up!"" Once again frozen in fear I waited for what felt like forever and slowly turned praying not to see a face. Nothing was there.

The next day at dinner I was recounting what happened to my mother. Her boyfriend piped up telling me that it might have been his mom's ex whom she had shot dead in our field for his abuse towards her. 

A year or so later I was talking about all the things that I had experienced and my mom told me a story of her own. She had dabbled with a ouija board with friends. They had stopped to get some beers from the garage and when they came back the TV was on and apparently on channel 666. I think my mom might have invited something into our lives that day. While we were swapping stories my now step dad says ""oh, stop you're a teenager who thinks it's cool to be haunted so you're making up stories"". A bottle that was on top of the fridge in the back was thrown at his head. 

Now, back to the nightmares. My older sister had told me she had a dream of the wicked witch coming out of the closet, but I always assumed it was at my grandma's where she spent most of her time. 

The two of us and my dad met for lunch and I had asked if the activity at his house had stopped. Now that I was older he was more honest and told me yes, after I moved out it had stopped, but they still burn sage for good measure. Well my sister didn't stay at my Dad's after the divorce so she had no idea what we were talking about.

So we started telling our experiences and after talking about nightmare 3 my sister stopped me and told me she had the same nightmare, at the same age, in the same room, of a witch coming out of the same closet. My dad then states that he has always felt uneasy around that closet.

I have two theories on why I am haunted. 1) my mom invited something into our lives with her ouija board experience. 2) the closet at my Dad's house was somehow a portal and they followed me because I am a sensitive and have always been open minded. 

Years later I met my boyfriend and his cousin shot himself. We rushed to the hospital but he was already gone, but everyone wanted to say goodbye. So, we went in and everyone is crying and all of a sudden so do I and I have the worst feeling of guilt and all I can think is ""I'm sorry, mom. I didn't mean it. I am so sorry."" Over and over again. As soon as we left the room, it stopped.

I still have occasional experiences but nothing like I used to. I know this is kind of all over the place but my life has been full of random occurrences that I still have no answers to."
"Watchers ""fallen Angel's""","Florida","Non Human Entities","One night about 2012 in the middle of summer, which was different than any other in my life. I was living alone in a camper on my parents homesite in the western Florida panhandle, an acre surrounded by woods with no neighboring lights visible, total darkness!. I woke around 2am, tea candle long burnt out, immediately with needed urge, cast myself silently onto the block step I used to step into my camper.

I looked ahead and up towards the moon shining as beautiful as ever and nearly three quarters full.

I turned to my right and saw a motionless black figure, gaze affixed southward and into the moonlight. It stood roughly 12 feet tall, maybe more. It had a decent girth to its figure of maybe four feet. I also noticed the drape of its wings around itself the shoulder part protruding upward making up the girth and its height.

 Then as my frozen bodied gaze retreated downward, another! This second dark spirit was facing towards the taller one, kneeling on one knee as if subjected in some curtseyed manner of reverence, three to seven feet away. This being was perhaps half the size of the taller one, but black as night as well.

 They both were right there! Talk about fear at first, but I calmed somehow after a few seconds, I was quick with my business. The silhouettes of trees and bushes behind them and to the tallest 's right side. Their darkness stood out with much more blackness as they were in front of the landscape as the moon shone on everything. With my breathing nearly halted, heart beating out of my chest and only being one step out and off the bed which is right at the door...omg!, I seemed to nearly will myself back onto my bed believing I was ok and sensed no ill will, although I was quite alarmed, lay down and went back to sleep. JWW"
"Trolled By A Ghost?","New York","Misc","I saw the Rock Isn't dead story and I wanted to share a kind of cool one I had along those lines. 

I had gone out with a girl the night before and had a fairly unmemorable date other than talking about an upcoming wedding I was planning to attend. 

I drank possibly one too many beers after the girl left, then I went home and went out like a light. I hadn't had a full sleep in days. 

When the dream began I was at a wedding or very formal affair. It wasn't the one I was attending or anyone's I knew. It seemed like it was of another time. Been listening to a lot of 1970s music so maybe this had to do with it. 

From what I remember I was with a girl at this affair. Like the girl I had met in real life I was raptured by her and she seemed to have a different kind of air about her. At one point in the evening she was gone. Just vanished. I was confused, startled, and I started asking people at the party where she went. One person, I can't remember who it was, said they knew but didn't want to tell me. I insisted that this person confess and I'd like to know. 

At this point I woke up from the dream with a jolt and heard someone whispering in my ear ""she slept with Chris Brown"". I remember it was something having to do with Chris Brown- slept with or broke up with, I can't recall. 

It was NOT like someone in my dream telling me this, it was like someone there in my bedroom whispering it to me. I looked around the room- heart racing, hair standing on end, and no one was there. There was just a really piercing ringing in my ears. Eventually I calmed down, wrote a note detailing the experience, and went back to sleep. 

My building was built in 2016 and is a brand new development. There is no history of incidents or anything unusual in my apartment or the building that I know of. It scared the wits out of me. 

Could it have been related to the girl I saw the night before? Or another girl I dated? The only other cause I can think of is that I sometimes take a medication at work that can produce very vivid dreams when in withdrawal. 

Chris Brown is a singer many years younger than me and I have no idea what he'd have to do with any of this. Still no clue what this was or what to take out of it. Any theories or suggestions are welcome. If anything else happens I'll be sure to update."
"Who/what Slammed The Door?","New York","Haunted Places","This story isn't full of any ""wow"" factor but it really happened. My parents told me this and they don't make up stories. 

It was July 1963 and they had just moved into a brand new house. New construction and they were the first owners. It was a 2-story house with the bedrooms upstairs. It was their first or second night living there and they had gone to bed. They were still awake when suddenly a door downstairs got slammed VERY hard. Nobody was down there and I was asleep in my crib upstairs with my parents. They had no air conditioning, windows were all closed and locked and the heat wasn't on since it was summer. It only happened the one time. I was only a year old so don't remember this but about 10 years later I had a lucid nightmare about 3 evil ""hippies"" hanging out in the same room where the door was slammed. At the time, I didn't know about the slamming door incident. 

Later that room became my grandmother's bedroom and I was never comfortable in there. I wanted her to move to a different room because it just always felt cold, sad and well, evil. 

They say that new construction and home renovations can stir the spirits. Maybe that's what happened. We lived in this house for 26 years and there were other oddities that mostly happened to me as a child. For a year or so, I would see a cylindrical column of a grey smoky haze that went from the floor to the ceiling just off the living room, always in the same spot. When walking past it I always walked faster...lol. Nobody else in the house ever saw it. 

This house was on Long Island, NY, which was previously occupied by Native American tribes, Dutch and English settlers. This was the first ""modern"" house to be built on this land. Seems someone wasn't happy about that!"
"I Think I Saw Myself Hovering Over Next To Me?","Mississippi","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","This is a little scary, I'm still a little shocked. This just happened about 30 minutes ago. 5:30am. I kept waking up throughout the night because my pillow kept falling over. I kept pushing it off the side of the bed with my head, and I could feel its absence every now and then and wake up. I don't sleep in the dark because I've had a few occurrences that have left me terrified of being alone and unable to see. 

In my bathroom, my dogs were sleeping on the floor and the light was left on like it always is. 

 I ""feel"" my pillow isn't under my head anymore so I open my eyes to get it from the floor when I see what at first I thought was myself and freaked out. I literally said,""Oh sh!t!"" Things I don't blurt out. It had my hair, but was black, and the face was off. I can't really remember because it was gone in like three seconds. The first thing I thought once it was gone was...""did I just see myself?"" The only light I had was from the bathroom so it was almost like a shadow? I'm not sure...I've always thought I ""saw things"" or could hear things, but this is the first time I actually saw something that was actually there with my own eyes. I'm not too bothered by it, I'm just not sure if I want to go back to sleep anymore. Don't want to wake up and have that thing closer to me. 

I have one of those ""kitchen dinner"" tables next to my bed because I was eating on it the previous night. That thing was hovering next to it, bent over, staring at me. It wasn't touching the floor. It seemed as if it was floating.

 I'm not sure what it was. I was awake. I wasn't dreaming."
"What Was Making That Noise?","California","Haunted Places","I lived with my mom at her house for 20 years and I have had quite experiences there and so have others. I do not live there anymore but I still remember everything I experienced while living there. This one in particular I thought was the scariest.

I had my girlfriend living with me, who is now my wife. It was us two, my mom, dad and my little brother living there at the time. My parents and brother went to go visit my eldest brother in Northern California so it was just me and my girlfriend at the house for a few days. We have cat and everyone who owns a cat knows that they love to run around and make noise at any time they please. So that is how our cat was, sometimes he would wake me up early in the morning from him being hyper and running around so I got use to it.

It was the second morning we were alone and my girlfriend woke me up around 5 am asking me ""Caro do you hear that?"", all I heard was our cat running around in our room and jumping on the dressers. I responded saying "" it's just Bagheera (our cat) "" but then I suddenly sat up cause I remembered that our cat was not there! We had left him at my girlfriend's mom's house when we went to visit a few days prior because she wanted him to stay to play with the cats she has. At that point I got so scared and ran up to turn on the light and saw nothing in the room. It couldn't have been a rat or something because the running around sounded heavy and much bigger, like if it was our cat. My girlfriend had such a scared look on her face and told me before she woke me up she heard someone in our kitchen moving pots around on the stove as if someone was cooking and heard someone setting a cup down on the counter.

I believed her because years before this incident I heard someone cooking in my kitchen as well while I was home alone."
"Delightful Experience","California","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","This happened to me about 6 years ago, me and few friends were hanging out and decided to go to a ditch (just plain land that had a few tracks). To get there we had to go under the street through I guess a tunnel or so (I don't know what they are actually called). There is a ramp you have to go up to get to the ditch area. I was the first one to run up the ramp and as soon and I got up there I saw a ghost running one of the tracks, he looked like an actual human but as a white mist. It was still day time and I saw him very clearly. I even saw what he was wearing; he was wearing very short shorts, a jersey and long socks. Like the outfits that they use to wear in the old days for track or baseball. I was stunned and stood there which felt like forever, like time paused for a bit. He was just minding his own business running the track and just disappeared into thin air. My friends had ran a up there a little after me and I asked them in excitement if the say what I saw. Nobody else saw him, they did not believe me. 

I don't care if they didn't believe me and thought I was crazy or just seeing things, but I know what I saw. It was actually a cool experience, not scary at all and actually happy I saw that. I have seen other things from the corner of my eye but even until this day I have not seen anything like I did that day."
"Am I Haunting My Own House?","Connecticut","Haunted Places","My youngest brother came into my room one morning and asked if I had gone into his room the night before. I was still sleeping and got annoyed and told him of course I hadn't. I didn't get home from my bar tending shift until about 4 in the morning and went right to bed. It was obvious he didn't believe me but I didn't care and told him to go away.

Because of things I've experienced over the years and general curiosity, I asked him later that afternoon why he thought I'd gone into his room. It took quite a bit of effort to get the full story from him and then only after other family members had begun to share experiences they'd had over the years did he tell the full story.

He was asleep. He woke up because someone was on top of him. He kept his eyes closed to feign sleep until he was prepared to retaliate against what he thought was a rapist. As this person sat on top of him, the covers were also being pulled off of him. He was getting ready to fight back, terrified, when he heard my voice whisper in his ear, ""do you have any weed?"" He rolled over and went right back to sleep thinking it was just me in his room.

He believes he was awake just as much as he thinks he must have been asleep.

When I pointed out I wasn't even home and that it was impossible for me to be sitting on top of him while also pulling off the covers, it was then I could tell he believed something else aka paranormal had happened.

The first night we moved into this house I remember a feeling of unease. It was unlike me, but I also remember feeling relieved before we moved in to find out the house was built in the 70s and no one had died in it.

But once I was sitting at the computer downstairs and out of the corner of my eye I saw what appeared to be an old man walk out of the bathroom behind me to my left and toward the staircase in front of me to my left.

My sister one time, lying on the couch in that same room, saw me come out of the bathroom and walk toward the same set of stairs. She called my name and as I walked up the stairs I turned to look at her but kept walking up the stairs out of sight. She thought I was being a jerk until she realized I wasn't even home. I was 300 miles away in upstate New York.

She was terrified.

My mother (who is very hard of hearing) on several occasions has burst into my room while I'm quietly reading or working on art in a panic, asking me what's wrong, swearing she heard me screaming for help.

One time I was in bed reading late at night when, clear as day, a creepy voice screamed right in my ear, ""help me!"" I froze, and looked around but no one was there.

I walked into the kitchen late one night and it was like a slap across the face: I KNEW someone else was in the kitchen standing by the fridge. But with all the lights already on, I couldn't see them.

My youngest brother says he sees shadows when he walks down the stairs. My mother sees them as she sits in the kitchen. My sister suffered from insomnia when she lived here and says it's because she was always too afraid of a presence she felt.

There was another time I heard a voice clear as a bell right in my ear but I can't remember what it said.

I wrote all this down last summer and sent it to a local paranormal group and they said they'd be over to the house ASAP but after we all talked we came to the conclusion that while it's scary in the moment, we don't believe anything here means to cause us harm. I never responded to the paranormal team after that.

I'm just concerned why my sister saw me, my brother heard me, and my mother continually hears me calling for help.

Am I somehow haunting my own house?

My middle brother and father haven't experienced anything (so they say) but my mother, sister, youngest brother and I have experienced all this and more. It comes and goes and doesn't seem to make sense.

Any ideas?"
"Mom's Disembodied Sobs","Louisiana","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","My experience happened in 2015. I had just moved backed to New Orleans from Florida and gotten an apartment. Then came hurricane Katrina. My parents and I evacuated to my sister's house in P.a. We were very stressed, especially my Mom. My sister had a large old house, and Mom and Dad and I were sleeping downstairs. Them in a bedroom and I on the living room sofa. My sister slept upstairs. 

 At 4:00 a.m. I awoke to my sis, Heather, standing over me and telling me to get up. Frantic, she asked if I heard Mom sobbing loudly, and I said I did not. We went upstairs, and she told me what happened. She was sleeping and awoke to the sound of Mom sobbing and screaming, coming from outside. She looked out her bedroom window and saw Mom leaning against a tree, yelling into her phone. She thought, what's going on? Heather ran downstairs and opened the door. Mom wasn't out there and it was silent. 

 Confused, she ran back inside to wake up Dad. She was shocked to see Mom in bed with Dad, sound asleep. That's when she got me up. 

 We went upstairs and she's telling me what's going on, when suddenly we heard Mom sobbing and screaming at the top of her lungs, sounding like she was at the foot of the stairs. We started running down, and when we reached the bottom everything went completely silent.

 I vividly remember the atmosphere feeling thick and prickly. We went into the bedroom to wake Dad up, and there was Mom, sleeping with Dad. They were both deeply asleep. We roused them both and related to them what happened. We were all at a loss explain this experience. To this day we still talk about it.

 My sister and I have witnessed other strange events, always together. Thanks y'all for reading my story, and I wish you all the best."
"Devil's Den In Gettysburg","Pennsylvania","Haunted Places","This event took place in July of 2013:

I am a member of the Boy Scouts of America, a Star Scout at the time (for those interested, I have since gotten my Eagle Scout). At the time, I was 15 years old and did good in school. Due to my grades, my parents allowed me to go on our units upcoming scouting trip to hike the Blue Ridge Mountains in Virginia, and then tour Gettysburg, PA on the way back home to New York. My dad, being an Eagle Scout and a troop leader, was tagging along. We (about 12 of us) were all very aware of the history of the Blue Ridge Mountains involving the American Civil War. My dad mostly wanted to tag along because he grew up in Roanoke and has always been sensitive to the paranormal, and was seeing if he could experience anything during the trip. Boy, did he...

We had been in the mountains for 10 days, hiked over 45 miles, sleeping in hammocks in the woods. Occasionally in the night, we would hear leaves being stepped on, a twig/branch breaking, but that was to be expected, considering it was the outdoors. The part that inspires me to tell this story happened on our way home, in Gettysburg. 

We decided to hike 5 miles through Gettysburg to get a 50 Miler Patch. We looked at everything during the day, but a lot of us agreed that we'd like to go on a ghost tour at night. So that night we did. And it honestly went as you'd expect. Walking around at night, learning about the history, but nothing out of the usual. When the tour was over, some of us wanted to do our own ""ghost tour"". We went into a shop and bought a pendulum. My dad has used a ouija board and a pendulum in the past, and knew how to properly open and close a session, so he was going to help us.

It was roughly 11pm when we took the pendulum to Devil's Den, an area with large boulders that has a steep drop off to some smaller boulders down below. You may want to google what it looks like to get a better idea. We parked the cars about 30yds away from the bottom. A few of the other parents stayed at the cars and talked, while the rest of us made our way to the smaller boulders, where we would sit down and start using the pendulum. Once my father opened the session, we started asking generic questions, like ""Did you die during the Battle of Gettysburg?"", ""Did you fight for the Union or the Confederates?"" and such things. About 15 minutes in, someone asked ""Are you an ancestor of someone that is here right now?"". It said 'Yes'. We went around the circle saying, ""My last name is ____, are you my ancestor?"". When it was my turn to ask, it said 'Yes'. It gave me chills, because my great great great grandfather, Hermann, did fight in the American Civil War. My father then asked ""Are you Hermann _______?"". It said 'Yes'. Suddenly my father yelled, ""Bulls**t! Hermann never fought in Gettysburg and didn't die in the war!"". Then, I heard a *thud* from behind me. Looked, and I didn't see anything. My dad said, ""We don't want you here anymore, please leave."" I hear another *thud* and then about 10 seconds later, I feel something hit my backpack, as if something fell onto it. I turn around, and there was a rock, about the size of a softball or a grapefruit, that fell down from the top of the rocks. My friend then shouted in pain as a rock in similar size, hit his arm. 

Considering there's a staircase that let's you climb to the top, I thought that there was someone up top that was throwing down rocks, not knowing we were down there. I shouted to the parents at the cars, asking if they could see someone up top. They said that they saw the silhouette of a guy on the top of the rocks. Me and my friend run up the stairs to confront this guy and tell him to stop. We got up there and the crickets, the frogs, everything went quiet. It was really unnerving. We didn't see anything. We shouted back down, ""There's nobody up here!"", to which the parents below replied, ""What do you mean? He's right in front of you! Just standing there!"". That's when chills went up my spine and I froze. I noticed how cold it was compared to down there. Easily 8-10 degree difference. I just turned to my friend and we shared the mutual look of 'we should go'. His flashlight, in which there was brand new batteries, died. That made us both go pale. 

Completely chilled to the bones, we sprinted back down to the bottom and told everyone that we should leave, and that whoever is here, doesn't want us here. My father closed the session and packed everything up. We got in the car, did a quick prayer, asking God to prevent anything or anyone from becoming attached and following us back home, and left. Every time I tell this story, I get chills and my voice shakes, as this event had such an impact on me. But eventually I want to go back to Gettysburg and try to catch something on camera..."
"Blues Brother","Georgia","Misc","My brother died in a tragic accident several years ago.

A few months after he died, my mother and I were sitting in her living room reminiscing about him when she suddenly asked me if my son (who was 10 years old at the time) would like to have my brother's black fedora hat.

My brother liked hats, specifically the fedora because when he was a teen he loved John Belushi and The Blues Brothers skits on SNL thus developing an affinity for the black fedora. 

I was a bit surprised that she offered because I had not mentioned to my mother that my son had recently asked to get a black fedora. It was an odd request from him because my son is pretty quiet, low key, and decidedly not one to wear a fedora. 

He and my brother were not ""close"" because we didn't see each other all that often - mostly just on holidays or birthdays - however, I'm certain my brother did love him. Furthermore, I had never discussed my brother's black fedora with my son and I don't recall seeing my brother ever wear it although my son may have seen him in it in a photo somewhere at my mother's house. So when my son asked for one I just thought it was one of those phases kids go through, with hats, haha. 

My mom gave the hat to my son that day and we left her house. It was a short drive home during which my son was grinning from ear to ear while wearing the fedora. 

My brother was very heavy on my mind during that drive home and I felt a deep sadness. The news was on the radio and it was mostly bad - so I changed the station in search of something to lighten the mood. 

The first station I switched to was playing ""Soul Man"". It was my brother's favorite cover song that John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd sang in the skit. 

I found a lot of comfort in that. It was such a coincidence that the song came on, I had never heard it on the radio before and I don't think I have since then. Was it my brother giving his ok for my son to have something of his that was significant? Or was it a mere coincidence? Who knows for sure, but I felt comforted and a sense of wonder."
"Ignis Fatuus (ghost Lights)","Florida","Haunted Places","Ghost lights (Ignis Fatuus) 

We always loved taking the kids camping. 

One summer night under a warm, muggy clear night sky in 2011, the time was only an hour or two into sunset. We were walking across the campground to the lake, which has a pier across it that's four feet wide.

 I was gazing into the darkness of the woods beyond the lake, which was marshy with hardwoods and some pines and very few bushes. I began seeing what I thought was lightning bugs. 

As we began crossing the lake I'm thinking that getting closer would help me finally catch it with my direct vision as I had lucked out on with the first couple. I began thinking I can't follow them! Which was an instant problem. 

All my life I have been accustomed to lightning bugs appearing in summer here in the south; and watching and following them with my eyes. 

I noticed that as I was trying to follow, ""the bugs"", I couldn't. Now keep in mind my first glance was caught directly with my eyes which turned immediately to peripherally noticing them. By this point I knew it was not lighting bugs and realized what I was seeing ghost lights. 

 I'd ran across the term researching Halloween folklore and many other things the internet of knowledge can reveal, a few years before. Anyway, there was an incredible number of flashing lights throughout the woods. They seemed to be bluish-white in color and were a pulse of magic in the darkness. There were more appearing in the first few feet off the ground than upwards. As I looked higher they were not present. By now I'm scanning my eyes all different directions and catching dozens pulsing.

I brought it to the attention of my kids and their mother who saw them. We did seem to see a similar light activity in the lake, but could have been reflections. I've also camped other times there and did not see them. JWW"
"The One Who Was Spying On Us","California","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I use to work inside a warehouse and I had three incidents when I saw someone who actually wasn't there. 

The first time I saw someone I thought it was our boss who was real pain in the butt. The managers inside the warehouse would wear a red vest, he is Caucasian, with blonde hair and blue eyes. I was working in a certain area just minding my own business, and I look over to the left of me where there are just some tables with computers (it is always empty because that area is only used during the day time and I worked overnight). But when I looked over to my left I saw our boss leaning over on the side of a computer and spying on us to see if we were working. I clearly saw his eyes looking at us, his blonde hair and red vest. I just rolled my eyes because I was irritated that he was actually spying on us, it took like 1 second for me to roll my eyes and when I looked back no one was there. It was impossible for anyone to move that fast or hide anywhere else, it was an open space and I can see everything around that area.

 It was really weird I thought I was just seeing things until it happened again a long time after.

The second time I saw something like that it was just me and one of my co workers. We went to lunch 30 minutes earlier than everyone else because we wanted to get some work done without any distractions. But when we came back our manager (a different one than before) wanted us to go to the back dock to make sure we didn't get backed up while she was loading packages onto the conveyor, we did not want to because we had our own work to do but we just sucked up and went to the back. There is a board where we hang up our the scanners and right there is where I saw her standing behind, peeking her head out spying on us. She's a short Hispanic lady with dark hair and always has a bun with a hair band in her hair and of course with a red vest. I saw every detail and I even saw her smiling, kind of like a giggle. I turned to my co worker to tell her and when I turned back which was about 2 second later, no one was there, no way anyone could leave that fast and nowhere to be found.

The last time I saw someone when I went to work early to put in some over time, I was the only one there in the back dock cleaning up. Then I saw a girl walk out of a trailer where we load packages (wearing an orange vest so this person really stood out, we all have to wear some type of vest for safety and visibility), she was walking towards the ship clerk desk that was just left of where I was standing. I walked the same way as her and I saw her walking passing the poles and big cardboard boxes (the only time I did not see her was as she was behind the cardboard boxes passing them), and once I got to the ship clerk desk I did not see her anymore, she was not anywhere in sight, it was weird but then again I was use to seeing things like that at work by this point. I did not get and bad energy from these experiences, I wonder if anything has happened in that area."
"Have You Seen Her?","North Carolina","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","3:30. The time I've been so anxiously waiting for all day. So mentally exhausted from a long day of pointless algorithms and discussions about why we should buckle down on learning the theme of the book we'd been assigned that week. I had been so eager to burst out of the school building and smell that oh so splendid smell of diesel that would carry me home. When I saw the three numbers that meant freedom I bolted into the crowded lot. I searched up and down the rows trying to find the big yellow contraption.

 ""Hey Erin!"" My friend Darla called out, running to catch up with me. ""Hey D"" I replied. ""Any fun plans for this weekend?"" She questioned. ""No just working"" I shrugged. Where was my bus? I scanned each of the rows and stopped dead in my tracks when I saw something very unusual and very out of place. As a junior in high school the sight of this was rare. A tiny child... A tiny girl who I assumed was only six or seven stood at the bus's steps. Something about her held my attention and wouldn't let it go. It was as if she'd glued my eyes to her and made everything else in the world disappear. Her hair was an orange red color and tied neatly into two pigtails, she held her purple flower dress neatly in place, and she held what looked like an old bag someone would've carried perhaps in the 1940s era. I couldn't look away on my own. I also noticed how a yellow glow, perhaps the sun, surrounded her. ""Erin? Is everything okay?"" Darla asked. ""Y...yea"" I stammered. ""I'm going to... Go over here. See ya later"" I began taking steps to the bus this little girl was standing at. When I'd turned my attention back to the spot after bidding Darla goodbye I couldn't help but let jaw fall agape. She was gone. The little girl had vanished. Surely I wasn't seeing things I thought to myself.

 I walked to the bus and looked at the bus driver. ""Um excuse me"" I said. ""Have you seen a little girl? Red hair? Dress. Six years old I think?"". ""Mm sorry darlin"" she shook her head. ""Don't no one under 14 ride my bus"". I looked out into the distance and thought surely I hadn't seen a ghost? A spirit of some sort? I'd only seen that in movies. I shook my head and hopped down back onto the asphalt and made my way to my bus.

 I knew better than to tell the delinquent children on my bus what had happened. The whole bus ride had been filled with my thoughts. Who was she? What was she? Was she in fact... A she? A person? From that day forward I'd forever be asking myself have you seen her?...this is my ghost story. Maybe you'll find her too..."
"Grandmother Mary","Nevada","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I was a young girl, maybe 9- 10 years old. I had been going to this elementary school in Las Vegas where we had a small fundraising carnival going on. My father had taken us to make up for not seeing us for almost a month.

 My little sister and I were all over the place having fun and playing the games when I got this retching feeling in my gut. It felt like a vortex swallowing me up from the inside out and all I wanted to to was lay down. I stood frozen trying to gather my bearings. My father didn't notice he was looking for my sister who had gone to participate in the Cake Dance game, but I was standing in the middle of a large crowd frozen -yet aware of my surrounds- when my vision began to blur and darken. I tried to look around as if someone could help but then I saw a figure in front of me. She looked as if she had been crying at first but then she smiled at me and waved goodbye to me then disappeared. The feeling that had me frozen left me instantly and I could see my father running up to me with his phone pressed against his ear saying ""we need to go now.""

 We got into the car and drove to my grandmother's house where my grandfather had been sitting on the porch crying, as my dad ran inside. Grandpa walked to the car and sat in the back seat, I asked him what happened as soon as he closed the door. He simply looks at me and I see the familiar face of tears as he spoke ""Now...you are going to need to give your daddy some time, me too.""

""What happened, grandpa?"" I asked again. And it was then he had just told me my grandmother Mary had passed away. I didn't know what it had meant but I didn't cry even though she was my favorite person in the whole world... But I had felt as if I had been given closure from the spirit I had seen at the carnival."
"The Play Room At Gramma's House","Ohio","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I have been debating for quite some time about posting this. But in reading other similar stories, I thought I would go ahead.

This happened not only to me, but also my older sister at the same time. Way too freaky to be coincidence or childhood imagination.

My sister and I spent the night at our grandparent's house usually a weekend or so a month when we were little. They had a small bungalow type house with living room in the front and a bedroom off of that, dining room next (again, with a bedroom) and you went through a doorway to the kitchen towards the back of the house and there was a small room off of that which we used as a play room.

One morning, when we were probably 4 and 6 years old, we woke up and went to the kitchen for breakfast. After breakfast, we went to our room (off the dining room) to change clothes. Gramma had said that we could play with toys after we got dressed. We came running out of our room headed for the play room and both of us stopped dead in our tracks upon entering. There was a man standing there dressed in what we called old farmer type clothes wearing a baseball cap and suspenders. My sister and I looked at each other then looked at him and he smiled.

Why we decided to play and not be scared still baffles me.

We would see signs of him off and on for years. A small indentation in the daybed or a toy moved from where it had been left. Every once in a while he would be standing there with his arms folded smiling at us as we played.

Fast forward 40 years (yes, I'm showing my age here) and our mother shows us old photos we'd never seen. She hands me one and my jaw dropped. I showed it to my sister saying, ""Hey Mouse! Remember Mr. W from Gramma's?"" She looks at the photo and her reaction was the same as mine.

Turns out he was an uncle, I believe related to my grandfather, who had stayed in that room at the house until he could be moved to a more permanent nursing care facility. We had never met him as he had passed well before we were born, but he was wearing the same type clothes in the photo as in the playroom.

Anyway, I hope you like the story. I feel it just goes to show kids can be very receptive and we naturally know whether or not to be scared.

Thanks for reading."
"Winking Twinkling Charlie","Massachusetts","Children Who See Spirits","I recently read a story on YGS about an experience while very young. In my opinion, many if not all speak and baby talk about seeing someone or something. Unfortunately the young children are easily dismissed as their words are hard to understand or the adults are too busy to listen. Then for most children the event is lost in their minds as there is so much happening so fast. So much to learn quickly.

I was fortunate to have my Mother to myself as my sisters were much older. I can even explain why my memories of my very young years is very vivid. I wish it was different, but I lost my Mom when still very young. I believe I kept memories because those very young years were so special. I can describe an outfit I had worn or a room I visited once. Even words said by an older cousin, is remembered in detail. Trama does that.

I was 2-4 years of age, it was summer and at least once or twice a week we would stop by for groceries at Charlie's. Old Man Charlie had started his store in the early 1900s, when aged in the 1940s, he had been teaching Young Charlie, his Son, all about the business. Old Man Charley died suddenly on a normal day, at his store. 

Young Charlie did his best, and the store thrived. I was smiling and winking one eye and then the other, just as the old man was doing, when Young Charlie said roughly ""why are you doing that"". This made my Mother jump and she pulled me to her. ""My Dad would wink just like that, when I was little."" Young Charlie was different with me after that. He seemed to always be watching me. I did continue to see Old Man Charlie, but had learned to be hush about things I saw. My Mother would not hear anything I had to say, when I spoke of something I saw or heard.

The face was funny, sticking out his tongue from under the loose hay on the floor of our barn. The warmth from the cows helped in the winter, the smells I had long ago learned to love, it was part of what my Father was. I had seen the funny face many times, big blue eyes, his hair was the same color as the hay, hard to tell what was what. My Mother was often at meetings, popular and involved in much. My Dad and the barn were my babysitters. As I played with the barn cat, my Dad asked me what I saw in the hay that made me laugh? I looked down, not wanting him to know. ""Was it a funny face"", he asked. Surprised I looked up, ""I saw him too, when I was young."" This became what my Dad and I could share, perhaps it is where I got this not so rare ability.

Take a quiet moment... A quiet moment of when you were tiny, most of us have some memory of an odd event, something you seen or heard, something that should not have been there."
"The Man Is Back","North Carolina","Shadow People","So to clear things up right off the bat, this story is being submitted on my girlfriends behalf, but I have some experience with it too.

As for some context:

She has a very dark history. When she was a baby, her mother had multiple affairs on her father. At some point, she wanted the guys she was messing around with to beat up her father, to 'get the message' that she was over him. Those two guys ended up shooting him in the head 4 times, and cutting his throat twice. Her mother was sentenced to life in prison. Her aunt had gotten custody of her, but from what my girlfriend told me, she was physically abusive, and at 17yo, kicked her out of the house, right before she graduated high school. She ended up moving in with one of her best friends. Due to all of this, she is not involved in religious activities at all. As ""if there was a God, why would he let this happen"".

My girlfriend and I (both 21yo) have been dating for just under a year and a half now. I met her on a personal vacation at my parents house in New York, while I live in North Carolina, as I am stationed here. We have been dating long distance until recently, roughly three weeks ago, she moved in with me, our first apartment, here in North Carolina.

My girlfriend has a gift. She used to be able to see people and hear people who have passed on. This was when she was younger, roughly between 8-16 years old. After 16, she stopped seeing and hearing them all together. At least until about 6mo ago when she came for my grandfathers funeral, where she stood outside the room as we all said our last goodbyes after he passed away from cancer. I was so upset that he never got to meet her, but when I went to see her in the hall, she told me about how he came to her, and finally met her, before passing on...

 But there's no gift like this that doesn't have a dark side... She told me about who she calls ""the Man"". A very skinny and pale man with pitch black eyes. She could feel his presence, whenever he was near, very oppressing. She told me about how when she was younger, he would sometimes be in a corner of her room at night, looking at her. A few times he was actually on top of her, pinning her to the bed. Other than that, he wouldn't harm her. She told me that she heard him mumble or like whisper, but could never make out what he was saying. This all occurred when she lived with her aunt, and stopped when she moved. To her, the malevolent spirit was tied to the house, as it would have followed her. It was a huge relief, as it felt like it was feeding off of her fear.

Fast forward to her moving in with me, about 4 years later, we had just finished getting settled into our cozy 1 bed 1 bath apartment. Relatively new, built in 2013. Not a worry in the world. But then she told me about how right before the move, she started seeing shadow people. Not harmful or anything, just shadow people out of the corner of her eye, minding their own business. But she also felt like she was being watched. Then it continued when she came down to NC. Seeing them in the corner, or at a quick glance, but nothing really that would obstruct with her day. I never saw anything like this in our new place. I occasionally heard footsteps in the night, but I just waived it off as our neighbors. 

One night, about a week into us living there, its roughly 12:15AM, we laid in bed, with the lamp on. On our cell phone checking Facebook and things like that. When we decided to go to sleep, I turned the light off and closed my eyes. I heard her start to cry, while trying to be quiet. I rolled over asking her what's wrong. She tucked her face into my neck and cried and whispered, ""The man is back. He's here"". I asked where he was, and she replied with, ""on the ceiling"". I looked up at our ceiling fan and saw a black mass. Kind of shaped like a bent oval. No light source could've casted this shadow, and it was getting darker. I quickly turned the light on and held her for a little while. I then went to my closet and dug out my Bible. She said she felt his presence leave at that point, but asked me to read some of it to maybe comfort her. As I was reading, maybe a page worth, she stopped me. Told me that the more I read, the more she was feeling sick to her stomach. I began to hear footsteps in our living room, walking around. Heard them walk up to our bedroom door, but that was the last time I heard them. That whole ordeal lasted about 10 minutes.

Since that night, about a week and a half ago, we haven't experienced anything except for the occasional shadow person minding their own business. I check every part of the room when I go to sleep at night, and keep our Bible out on the nightstand. I can't tell if this is a malevolent spirit, a demon masquerading as a pale, skinny man, or whatever. I just want answers... I suggested church, but she's iffy on the idea. We want to burn some sage, but have yet to find a local shop that sells it. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thank you"
"Grim Reaper Or Shadow Person?","Tennessee","Shadow People","When I was little, about seven years old, I would always see this sort of figure. It was almost like a shadow but it was pitch black. It had a pointed hood, just like the grim reaper. Now I know that some people say that the grim reaper is supposed to stand for death, but I didn't feel that way. Whenever this figure came around I wasn't scared of it. It was more like a companion. 

 One afternoon my best friend came over and we were going to go outside and play. We went out the back door and stepped on the back porch. 

 (I had previously mentioned to him that I was seeing this figure.) Anyway, when we stepped outside I saw it standing in between the neighbors yard and my yard. I pointed at it and told my friend that I saw it. But he claimed that there was nothing there. I didn't think anything about it and we just went about our day like nothing happened. 

 About a year ago I suddenly remembered that I used to see this figure. I haven't seen it since I was little. But I have done research, and I learned that they are called shadow people. Although, I am still confused on whether I saw a shadow person or the grim reaper. When I saw this figure, I also noticed that it didn't hold a scythe, like the grim reaper does. If any body has any suggestions to what I may have been seeing, I would love some input. 

 I haven't told many people about this experience in the fear of them not believing me. I haven't known of anybody else who has seen this sort of figure. But again, if you have any suggestions, I would love to hear them. 

 Thanks, Em1234"
"Rock Isn't Dead","Georgia","Family / Friends Visits","On March 9th, 2018 I was awoken suddenly at 1:14 am by the sound of a few notes played on my 12-year-old son's electronic keyboard in his room. 

I waited a moment before getting up to investigate, just in case I was dreaming. Then I heard a note played a second time. I thought that maybe my son must be up, in which case it would have been very unusual. Our rooms were close together and I would have heard it had he been up. 

I laid in bed a short moment, trying to figure out who was playing the keyboard at that time of night. The cat sometimes sleeps in his room so I rationalized that the cat decided to play a little night music. The notes, however, sounded too composed to be a random cat walk. Also, the cat had no history of jumping on the keyboard, it was not entirely sturdy enough to handle a pounce. 

I decided to go investigate. 

I wasn't worried, just curious, as I crept down our hallway to his room. I quietly peeked in to find that he was sound asleep. I used to work nights at a psychiatric hospital and it was part of my job to check on the patients throughout the night. I knew the signs of deep sleep and my son was definitely sleeping soundly.

After scanning the room and finding nothing amiss, I decided that maybe my son forgot to turn the keyboard off and it just sounded a note for no reason, maybe an electric issue or something of that nature. Eager to get back to bed, I went to my room. When I reached my doorway (only about 10 feet from my son's door) it dawned on me that his keyboard display was not lit up like it does when the keyboard unit is turned on. 

I went back to his room for further investigation. I saw the cat awake on his bed, blinking sleepily but standing up and facing the keyboard. The cat is not nocturnal - when we turn in for the night he picks a room/human to sleep with and snuggles in for the duration, often curled into a ball on the bed. I thought it unusual for the cat to be staring at the keyboard so I walked over to the keyboard and pressed some keys. No sound came out, confirming that the power was turned off. 

I checked my son again and he was softly snoring. I shrugged the incident off as unusual but not alarming, thus went back to bed. 

The next morning, I woke my son up for school. As he rolled over in bed I saw the back of his tee-shirt and couldn't help but smile at the words printed on it - ""ROCK ISN'T DEAD...it's just played by Ghost Of"".

The shirt belonged to my deceased brother who had been in a band called ""Ghost Of"". He died suddenly and tragically in 2015. He loved music and his lifelong dream was to be in a band. He finally made his dream come true a few years before his death. My son had never worn that shirt before even though it had been in our possession for some time. It is curious that the first time my son wore that shirt I was awoken by the sound of a musical instrument in my son's room. But that wasn't the only coincidence. 

My brother and I were very different people, he was charismatic and outgoing with many friends. I am a quiet introvert who prefers staying home rather than going out to parties. Despite our differences, we had two main things in common: a love of ghost stories and music. We would often sit around the table telling ghost stories and he would jokingly tell me that he would come back to visit me when he died. 

Maybe it is true, ""Rock isn't dead, it's just played by ""Ghost Of""."
"Invisible Stalker?","Michigan","Haunted Places","This is my first year up in Marquette and I always like to know if the town I'm living in is haunted or has haunted places to visit. I did my research and found a couple places that are haunted. One of those places is the NMU college that I'm currently attending. I read about the stories and got a little spooked since I was in my dorm room by myself.

 While I was reading the stories my roommates bookshelf fell over. This normally happens so I thought nothing of it and picked up everything (remember this).

 I decided to go to my friend's house which is about two miles away from campus. It was cold out so I figured I would drive there. As I'm walking to my car, I hear footsteps coming from behind me. My first thought was that it was another student walking to their car. But these steps got closer and closer and closer until I got nervous and turned around, no one was there. I freaked, ran to my car, locked the doors, and drove off. Everything was fine during the drive to my friends house and during the time I was there. I didn't tell them what I experienced since I didn't want to make it a big deal.

After spending some time with them, I decided to leave since it was a school night (this is where it gets creepy). Instead of walking to my car this time, I immediately ran to my car and locked the doors. Across from where I parked was a gas station. At that gas station there was a person sitting by the doors that go into the gas station. The person was wearing all black with their head down. Warning bells were ringing in my head and the little voice in my head was also saying ""Go go go! Start your damn car!"" I listened to those instincts and drove off.

 For the first mile there was no cars and no one walking around. Then, out of nowhere a person pops up in front of me, also. Wearing. All. Black. I act normal and keep driving towards the person until I'm roughly 40 feet away and they decide to cross the street! I slam on my breaks as they take their time crossing. At this point I wasn't even thinking about paranormal stuff. I was just pissed off that someone decided at the last minute to cross the street. 

I finally arrive at campus and go to every parking lot near my dorm, then farther parking lots, and eventually realize there's no parking spots; like usual... I park on a side street and start walking to campus. It was roughly a seven minute walk to my hall, so I picked up the pace, walking a little bit faster. I'm about halfway to the dorms when I hear someone say ""hello"". I immediately do a 360 to see where that ""hello"" came from. In my head I was thinking it was coming from a person in their house or from a car parked in the lot I was walking pass. Nope, neither. With everything that had already happened, I clutched my pepper spray and ran to my dorm. 

As I'm closing in on my hall I check to make sure no one was behind me just in case I was being stalked. Praying that I won't see anything, I end up seeing a dark figure coming right at me closing the gap between us. I struggle to open the door and feel as if I'm paralyzed in fear. The hairs on the back of my neck stand up when I feel heavy breathing. I don't bother looking back again and open the door to my hall. As soon as I step inside I feel safe. I make it to my dorm and drop all my stuff on the floor and lay on my futon. I go to pick up my phone and out of the corner of my eye, I see the bookshelf knocked over. But this time only the books were off the shelfs... The shelf was still standing upright. 

To this day only the books fall of the shelf at random and I constantly feel like I'm being watched. I have never truly believed in ghosts. I was only interested in reading stories and never thought I would be writing my own experience. I want to believe that it was all a dream, but it was very much real."
"I'm Being Followed By A Dark, Cloaked/hooded Entity","Missouri","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","The first time I recall seeing him was when I was around 8 years old. My bed had recently been moved to face the window in my room. It was nighttime but quite well lit outside and I saw this cloaked, black figure with a hood covering most of his face. What I could see of his face was white and maybe translucent and there seemed to be some blood dripping down it. I'm not sure if I would say he was solid but I did see him very clearly.

The next time I saw him was when I was around 12 or 13. I was sitting in my basement (different home) with a friend, facing her. I blinked and in my mind's eye I saw the basement from her perspective somehow and saw him standing behind me in a doorway.

I went to a little wiccan shop and scared the daylights out of the owner. She basically ran away as soon as I entered the store. Her husband told me that she sensed some dark energy about me. I took this as me having darkness in my aura. 

The order of events gets a little foggy from here, and there were plenty of paranormal experiences in this time frame that may or may not have to do with this particular entity so I'll leave those out for now but I should point out that after the basement incident I made the very poor decision to use a ouija board in that basement. I wanted to contact my uncle but I believe I invited in other spirits and perhaps allowed this entity to gain a stronger hold on me. 

Shortly after that I started hearing him in my head. It sounds crazy, and maybe it is, but he was communicating with me very clearly and non-threateningly. He told me his name (which I have since forgotten) and quite a bit about who he supposedly was. I don't remember all of the details but he claimed to be someone from one of my past lives that was very similar to this one in which I committed suicide at the age of 17. He implied that he was trying to help me. 

Things started to get scary for awhile and I assumed it was this spirit and that he was trying to trick me somehow so I decided to do a binding ceremony. Considering the fact that I was in my early teens and had no idea what I was dealing with (still don't but I'd like to think I'm a little more cautious now) I don't think it went as planned. 

He stopped talking in my head. I haven't exactly seen him since. But I have felt him, although I wasn't sure if it was him or not at the time. My husband has caught glimpses of him in every house we have lived in (5 different locations) and thought that it was something haunting him. I have saged my homes. I have cleansed this home of negative energies. But there is something here. 

The reason I'm writing about this now is because last night I had a conversation with someone who barely knows me. She is my step brother's girlfriend and we haven't spoken much but my mom brought up the shop incident and asked what it was that the owner had said to me. When I answered that my energy bothered her she said that she didn't think it was mine. She said that when she first met me she also had to leave quickly because she saw a cloaked figure standing behind me and that he didn't want anyone else near me. She's very scared of him and didn't even want to say anything to me about it. She didn't want to admit that he was there last night, too, but he was. What threw me off was that she described him to a T without ever knowing my story.

So, here I am at 26 years old, this entity has been following me around for around 18 years. I thought he was gone. I have gone back and forth between feeling like he is malevolent and feeling like he is a misunderstood guiding spirit... But either way I feel like he is hindering me from reaching my full potential. 

Does anyone have any advice or experience with something similar? Especially considering I believe I have bound him to me? I'm not sure I should release him from his binding because he could be malevolent and I don't want to release that into the world, but I would also like to be free of him."
"Watching?","Idaho","Haunted Places","My wife and I like to explore old abandon properties as a sort of hobby on the weekends.

 One weekend we drove by an old house that looked abandoned and it wasn't posted to keep out and nothing was locked up like the gate or barn that was adjacent of this old house. There were old farm implements and several outbuildings on this property.

 The barn doors were wide open and we entered, being careful not to touch or disrespect someone else's property and/or belongings. It's hard to explain the feeling we both felt almost immediately upon entering the barn. We walked around inside the barn and there was some cool old tools, and a motorcycle etc. We took a few pictures inside the barn and decided that we should probably head home and we had a creepy feeling like someone was watching us but it was obvious there wasn't anyone still living on the property. It was pretty run down and the doors to the house were all boarded up from the outside.

 Just before we got to the gate to leave my wife, using her phone camera snapped a few pictures. One was of the house from probably about 200 feet, and one of the barn. All the while we both still had a weird feeling that someone was watching us.

 As we were driving home my wife was looking at the pictures she had just taken and all of a sudden she said ""Oh My God, there was someone there watching us"", and she showed me a picture that she took of the house. Sure enough there was an older gentleman in the upstairs window of the house and when she zoomed in on him, it was obvious this guy was mad.

 We continued on our way home, pretty much in awe at what the picture had captured. We were like well no wonder we had the feeling someone was watching us, because there was and the guy was obviously mad at us for invading his privacy.

 When we looked back as we were leaving the property, and my wife snapped a few pictures, I remember specifically looking at the upstairs windows and there was nobody visible so we figured that the old man in the window was a ghost. For one, the house was nailed shut from the outside, which means if there was a real person in the house, he was locked in there and left with no obvious way to get out.

 But as we were sitting on our couch at home looking at the other pictures, it became very obvious, without a doubt that we had just experienced our very first ghost, because in one other picture that was snapped at the barn, there was another person and it was without a doubt a picture of a ghost because there was a girl almost completely naked except for her pantys and she was transparent and it looks like her head is on backwards... I'm trippin right now telling you this experience. That's pretty much the end of my story and to this day we won't even drive by this property in fear of dragging one of the ghosts home with us."
"Footsteps On My Bed","Alaska","Haunted Places","I remember one specific night when people tell me about their paranormal experiences and I can remember it so clearly. 

When I was much younger, maybe 5 or 6, I used to sleep with my mother on a king sized bed. We lived in a small trailer court in Alaska at the time and we lived a typical life, mundane and uneventful. 

One night we were both sleeping in a dark room with no noises or family members around, yet something was going to wake us from our normal routine. I slept on the left side of the bed and my mother on the right side. There wasn't anything special about that day or night that could predict what was about to happen to my mother and I. 

Out of nowhere I started rolling towards my mother to the point where I could open my eyes and be face to face with her. After a moment of confusion and not seeing anything in the room with us, my mother simply smiled at me and told me to go back to sleep and at the time I just did. I didn't think of the fact that it was just me and her there and what had awoken us from our sleep was footsteps walking between us from the foot our bed to our heads.

 I can't think of why that had happened and it hasn't happened since, but the memory still haunts me. The feeling of the footsteps one by one, dragging me and my mother to the center of the bed are too real. They weren't light like a cats light steps, they were large and heavy like a grown man had just ran between us. I don't think my mother slept that night, or got much sleep after that for a while. It was the first experience I had with the paranormal but not the last."
"She Needed Help","Florida","Haunted Places","A few years ago my family and I traveled to a small beach town on the east coast of Florida for a quick overnight stay. My 14 year old daughter was volunteering to help with an event, so my husband, myself, and son went along. 

While searching the internet for a hotel close to the venue, I was intrigued by a charming old ""motor lodge"" style motel that appeared newly renovated. It was situated on historical highway A1A and built very close to the edge of the two lane road. On the other side of the highway was a vast expanse of quiet beach on the Atlantic ocean. You could step out of your motel room door, cross the quaint highway, pass a through a small patch of dune and be on the beach. 

The website images of the motel depicted a trendy little establishment, it was not fancy but appeared clean and appealed to my sense of nostalgia. 

Upon check-in the evening of our arrival, we were amused to discover that the renovation consisted of spray painting everything white. As much as I can recall they painted just about everything except the floors and beds. In the bathroom they even painted the 50's style tub, sink, faucet, electrical outlets, shower head, toilet, all window molding, window frames, etc. It was surreal and quite amusing. We laughed about it and then went to dinner. We didn't stay out late nor consumed anything alcoholic as we would have a long hot day in the sun the next day. 

Back at the room we prepared for bed. My daughter and I shared a double bed and my husband and son shared a double right next to us. We all went to sleep quickly and slept soundly for the night. 

At dawn I awoke to the sensation of something small and slight jumping onto the foot of my bed. I felt it begin to walk up the length of the bed right next to me. I recall wondering how in the world a cat got into our room. I tried to move and open my eyes but I couldn't. 

I have experienced sleep paralysis before in a few instances when traveling but never to the extent or horror that was about to occur. 

The ""cat"" walked up to my face, sniffed my left ear (I felt it and heard it), sniffed my closed eye, then walked behind my head on the pillow - I could feel the weight of every paw. I then felt it walk over to my sleeping daughter and then jump to the floor. 

The next I remember is standing at the foot of the bed in front of a woman who was dripping wet. Her hair was long and hanging in a damp manner on either side of her face. Her clothing was saturated as well. She was pleading softly ""Help Me"" and quietly sobbing. I kept asking her how could I help? We continued this exchange for some time. She gradually became more frantic. ""Help Me"" was the only thing she would say, over and over. Finally I said ""I can't"". Without warning her face turned menacing as she lunged towards me to grab my hands, she roared ""HELP ME!"". I screamed and jumped backwards to avoid her grasp, then woke up in my bed. I checked on my daughter and she was still asleep as was the rest of my family. 

That was the most vivid and realistic sleep paralysis I have ever had. Among the few instances prior to this I would just wake up unable to move. Never had I felt a cat or seen or communicated with anything. 

If I were an imaginative sort (I am) I would think that maybe this woman drowned in the ocean that was mere feet from the motel. She needed some help and I couldn't help her. 

I was glad to check out the next morning."
"A Man I Can Not Explain","North Carolina","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","This may appear a tad unusual - the post has been written in three sessions over twelve days. I wanted to record my initial impressions to share with you if I could not satisfy myself as to what I saw. I thank you for your indulgence...

I had an unusual sighting this morning- January 7th, 2019.

Most week day mornings, weather permitting, I take our dog, Sadie Mae, for a pooh stroll of approximately three quarters of mile, roughly 30 minutes starting around 5:30. For those curious I always have three pooh bags on hand, more if I'm with Sadie. We see, for the most part, the same people doing the same things with very little variation.

 First a slight description of the area: after taking a right turn on the right hand side of the street there are two houses, followed by a small cemetery, followed by more houses until the next right turn, approximately a half mile. On the left, in the corner, is the church's house followed by woods. The house nearest the cemetery has a motion sensor light which Sadie and I activate most mornings from the street. The cemetery covers roughly an acre, and most of the names on the stones are the same as the name of the street upon which we walk. There is a church which is located behind the two houses. The church's house is a house owned by the church which has been used to house hospice patients to keep them near their church and minister. How many people have died in that house I can not say but certainly more than a half dozen in the twenty years we have live here. Currently the church's house is unoccupied and undergoing renovations. 

This morning, after making the right turn, I saw a man walking towards us from the direction of the cemetery (there are any number of houses beyond the cemetery so he could have come from one of them). There are two things remarkable about this: 

First - he's the first person I've seen walking at this hour of the day in this location, and I've been on this walk for six or seven years. I have seen people out and about, normally I see two or three cars, and two or three people walking from their doors to their cars. Once or twice a week, if we're running a tad late, I see an elderly neighbour get his morning paper from the end of his drive. 

Second - he didn't set off the motion sensor light, which Sadie and I did as we passed the house. Now I'm a large man and Sadie and I together make a much larger target for the motion sensor than most people, but the Cuddlewife has told me she and Sadie have set off the motion sensor when they passed. I can not come up with a plausible reason he didn't set off the sensor.

When I first saw him he was in the area where Sadie and I normally set off the light, so I had at first assumed that the sensor wasn't on. That happens from time to time, but Sadie and I activated it after passing him. I can't really describe him too well, it was dark and he was wearing dark clothes. We did exchange greetings (I didn't recognize the voice but I don't know everyone who lives back there). Sadie reacted to him as well, the way she reacts to most strangers, friendly and wagging. 

After Sadie and I activated the motion sensor I turned to take another look at the man, I could not see him. Whether this was because he blended into the background, made the turn, or went into a house I can not with any certainty say. I think I would have heard him enter a house if he had, I do hear people leave their houses in the quiet of that hour.

I should also mention that, other than walking for exercise or visiting neighbours, there is no reason to be walking around this area. The nearest place of business is the County Complex, about a mile and half away. The nearest store is some ten miles away. There is no bus stop nor is there any public transportation of any kind here. The area is becoming increasingly suburban but remains pretty rural.

January 14th, 2019

It has been a week since I saw that mysterious figure and I've not seen him since. Over the weekend I was able to ascertain that no one new had moved into the neighbourhood.

 Over the course of the week Sadie and I performed some experiments to determine just how far away from the house a walker must be for the motion sensor light not to be activated. The result was that I could not pass the house without tripping the sensor, even when I walked along the tree line across the fence giving about an additional six feet of open grass. I can not conceive of a way that individual could have passed the motion sensor without activating it.

A second point Sadie and I looked into was my inability to see him after we had activated the light. Taking some crude measurements and re-enacting the events as best I could I determined that the figure could not have made the corner had he maintained his pace, he'd have been perhaps 25 yards short of the point. This would have put him in the field of light coming from the first house's front window, which is usually on at this time of day. This makes my inability to see him after the event even odder than I had at first assumed. 

January 18th, 2019

I had arbitrarily decided to submit this on Monday the 21st, I was hoping to find more information, specifically another sighting which would convince me that what I had seen was a man. However on this morning's pooh stroll we had another, very different encounter. 

Prior to coming to our first corner I noticed a large white form in the yard beside the church's house. The form was about six feet tall and appeared to be a smaller sphere sitting atop a much larger structure, giving the overall impression of human like form. The whole form seemed to be changing shape, like a poorly defined mist. Given that I was looking for the figure I had seen before I was somewhat taken aback. I stopped and observed the form for a bit.

 Sadie showed neither fear nor even interest in the apparition, so we sallied forth and discovered, to my amusement and relief, it was a freshly installed propane tank; as I mentioned the church's house is undergoing renovation. The shape changing impression was caused by shadow cast by trees moving slowly in the light breeze. I included this tale to show that I am not given to seeing things which aren't there, and that when I see something I can't explain I am given to investigating it. I admit readily that my earlier sighting has led to my imagination playing tricks on me.

So the YGS readers who've stuck it thus far, what do you think the figure might have been? I'd like to think it was a man, but I can't get around the facts it didn't set off the motion sensor light and that it seemed to vanish when it got behind me. If it was only that I lost sight of it after passing I'd not be so bothered. If it was a paranormal/supernatural entity it is of a type I am unfamiliar with. It did not inspire fear in either of us. It did respond to my greeting, though I can't recall exactly what it said (hello, hi, good morning, 'morning) it struck me as a normal response. In body type it seemed like a perfectly normal man of average height and weight, somewhat smaller than myself. 

So I'd like some thoughts from the YGS community. Any thoughts, ideas, or tests would be appreciated.

I will say this, that since I saw that figure, I lock the house when I leave with Sadie, something I never did before."
"Down A Dark Hall","Georgia","Haunted Places","I already despise the story that I am about to share because it has no ending. Twenty-one years have past since the activity started, and, at first, it seemed quite harmless, almost funny...ALMOST. But lately, there seems to be a new presence with more influence, and it has become quite frightening.

 The house in which we live was purchased due to the convenience of its location. I grew up next door to this house in a pleasant and safe neighborhood full of loving and friendly neighbors. I saw several families come and go over the years, but the young couple who were the second owners of this house stands out the most due to the birth of their two children while they lived here. I babysat quite often over the years since I lived next door. They were wonderful people and fit perfectly into the neighborhood. 

 Years later, after my first husband and I divorced, I bought the house so that my eight-year-old son and I could live next door to my mother. I had met a young man from our small town that had those special qualities that I was looking for in a partner. We married, and 14 months later, my second son was born.

 The young girl who had lived in this house many years before passed away just after the birth of my second son. The baby's room had belonged to the young girl who once lived here. It wasn't long before the activity reached a whole new level. When my second son was 2 1/2 years old, he was playing in his room while I was folding laundry on his bed, and he stopped and asked me if this room once belonged to a little girl. I told him that it did, and I began looking around to see if I could figure out how he knew that. We had never mentioned it before, there was no pink paint on the walls, and the carpet was earth tone. There were no indications that a female had once occupied the room. He continued to play for another minute or two, and then he stopped again and told me that she had died and that her name was Tracy.

 I immediately froze! How could he possibly know that? She had not lived in the house for over 20 years! I tried to remain calm, and I told him that he was correct. When I asked him how he knew that, he told me that she had just told him. I quickly gathered a few of his toys and a change of clothes and told him that we were going to visit next door with my mom. I had to tell someone what had happened, but it needed to be someone who would not think I was totally crazy. 

 This is how the story begins. I had no idea what I would be facing in the future or how it would affect my family. The experiences that started that day have opened doors that I did not believe were possible. I will continue to share the remaining events if you are truly open-minded and interested in taking this journey with me, but I must warn you, these events are true. You may find yourself searching for logical explanations, but there aren't any."
"Memory Lane","North Carolina","Haunted Places","The year was coming to an end, with it being late October, 2009.

This was when I was still in my first marriage, and had just moved out from our apartment. At this time, I recently had found out that I was now pregnant, with my second son. 

With us having to quickly find a new place to rent, due to our lease ending at the apartment we were staying at, as well as needing the extra room for our new coming addition, I finally found a place that seemed to meet what we wanted. 

I wasn't able to be too picky with what we found, as all our other choices were pretty bad (the other places I looked at before the one we settled on, were falling apart). 

Our new home was directly beside a busy road, but at the beginning of a decent neighborhood, with the street name being, Memory Lane.

Before we moved in our new place, I remember not being able to shake the weird feeling I would get, when looking at our new home. It started to make me worry as to why I felt the way I did, in fear of us having to live in another haunted house. But I tried to just push my feelings aside, and be happy with our new place. 

When we finally had moved in, I could feel something off in our home. I knew that my fear had to be true, and that we were not the only ones in this home. I just hoped that whoever was there, was at least not anything bad. 

Not long after living there, my oldest son (who was 4 at the time) started to wake me up at night, saying that the little boy in his room wouldn't let him sleep. I remember asking him more on the details, and him telling me that this boy keeps wanting him to play with him, and won't let him sleep. Naturally that had me freaked out, that not only do we have a child spirit in our new home, but that it's trying to play with my son, to the point that it won't let him go to sleep.

I would let my son sleep with me, whenever he came to me saying this, so he was able to sleep.

After being told about this little boy, whenever I would go into my son's room, I could sense a presence in there, that would try to hide really fast, either in my son's closet, or behind a wall that stuck further out, to where you had to go all the way into the room, to fully see that area. 

There were times when I would be down stairs in the living room, watching tv, and I would keep seeing something in my peripheral vision. It looked like something was running into the living room, from the bottom of the staircase, to hide behind the couch, or recliner. 

I have a male friend that would stay on our couch a lot, and he would constantly talk about seeing the same thing, and referred to it like a child playing hide and seek. 

I thought it was crazy how he thought it to be a child, when my son was saying how he can see a little boy. 

There was also times when my son's toys would randomly go off. One in particular toy, was a big car that had a remote to steer it with. It seemed to be the toy that went off the most. It got to the point where I was tired of it going off so much, that I just put it on top of the refrigerator. Not long afterwards, one night while sitting in our living room with my then husband, and a friend, we heard something in the kitchen. We realized that it was my son's car going off, that hasn't been touched in a few days, maybe weeks (sorry, I'm not sure on the details of how long it was). Freaked out by what we're hearing, we all slowly creep into the kitchen, and see the car on the fridge, flashing lights, going off (not actually moving or driving though, just noise). The remote to the car was still turned off, as well as the switch to the car itself. Needless to say, we all were pretty unnerved by seeing that.

There were times when we had people over, and they would ask us about my son being up stairs, when to their surprise, would see that he was down stairs. Apparently some of our friends and family would see a little boy at the top of our stairs, as they came into our house, because our front door was directly in front of our stairs, where you could clearly see to the top of the stairs as you came in. 

After experiencing so much activity, I asked my friend to come and see our new place, and tell me what exactly I am dealing with here. This is the friend I mentioned being a lighthouse to spirits, and is able to see and communicate with them, in one of my previous submissions on here, called ""Living with a lighthouse"". 

When my friend came over, as she walked through our front door, she immediately looked up to the top of our stairs, saying that she saw a little boy watching her come in. She decided to go upstairs, and sit in my son's room, since it seems to be where the little boy is at the most, and she said that she can see him trying to hide in the closet. I told her that I could feel him try to hide from me, whenever I would come in there. 

I asked her about the little boy, and why does it seem wherever I go, there's always something where I live. She told me that the little boy was lonely, and what she believed was that he may not have exactly had any ties to this home, but was more so attracted to me, because I'm a mother, and pregnant. 

She said that she doesn't believe that everywhere I live is haunted exactly, but that I'm somehow attracting them to me. 

Which I guess makes me more sensitive to the paranormal, but I'm fine with how I feel them, as having the ability to actually see and talk to them, would scare me too much. 

At one point, towards the end of my pregnancy, my son had asked me where his dad just went, and I told him that he's been gone for a few hours now. He said that he saw him walk through the living room, into the hallway, as he was about to walk into the living room. For some reason, I was curious if he had actually saw his grandfather, that had passed away before I knew his dad. My son's dad, looked just like his own dad when he was his age. So I grabbed the one photo we just recently got at that time from a family member, of my husbands dad, and showed it to my son. He said that's who he saw. 

I told this later to my husband, and after what all happened in our personal life while living there, he said he couldn't help but wonder if his dad visiting was a sign to him. As far as I know, that was the only time my son ever saw his grandfather. 

Living in this home for me, never really felt warm, or inviting, but honestly I consider that to be because of my personal life while living there, affecting the mood. As for that bad feeling I got whenever I would look at this home, I also believe to be because of my personal life. Unfortunately while living there, I found out that I was being cheated on, and was abused to the point of our family breaking up, and since then, was never able to fix what all went wrong in that marriage, despite how much I tried. 

I believe the feeling I got when I first saw this place, was because I knew it would be where my first marriage would end. That feeling of dread, and nothing but negative energy is what I had in that home."
"Confirmation From Our Dog","Alabama","Haunted Places","My three children and I rented a house for a few years in Mobile County, Alabama, starting in 2015. Shortly after our first year there in the house, I began to notice small instances that alerted me that we may not be alone. Tapping on windows, misplaced items, nothing traumatic. 

It did, however, start to become more distinct. For example, I would hear my phone be thrown to the floor over and over again, while I would be home alone. At this point, I have accepted it may be an entity, and because I never got a bad energy from it, I was not at all worried about our safety and well-being.

 Eventually, my children started experiencing their own encounters. My teenage daughter came to me one night, asking why I keep messing with her door. Confused, I asked why would she think I would be doing that. I was then told she closed the door a couple of times, and when she would turn around, it would be slightly opened again. After examining the door, she knew there was no way for it to pop back open on its own. So I finally told her about my experiences and informed her there is no reason to freak out. If she wasn't comfortable, to politely ask it to leave. 

My oldest son's first experience was shortly after my daughter's. After laying him down for bed, I could hear him saying ""What?"", ""Come in"". Then about 15 minutes later, he told me someone keeps tapping on his window. He thought it was tapping on his door. After checking the outside, making sure it wasn't any branches, I finally told my son as well. We were all accepting of it, but never taunted it, nor talked about it a lot inside the house. Our encounters subsided after a while.

 At this time, I started working for a Vet Clinic and often fostered dogs. I ended up adopting this 3 year old yorkie that my children and I fell in love with. One night, me and my dog, Baxter, were snuggled up on the couch while I was watching a movie. Baxter was fast asleep when all of a sudden his head pops up and his eyes darted towards the blank wall facing us. He stood up, front paws on my lap, and just stared for about 10 minutes. I figured he may have heard something outside and went back to watching my movie. I started to feel his legs trembling, and that's when I noticed all his hair down his back was standing straight up. Then his deep growl started. I am trying to not move, trying to not distract him, because I had the feeling of what he may be growling at. Our entity must be back. Slowly, his deep growls turn into lip curling snarls. I have never heard such a sound come out of a yorkie before. With every breath, he would bark. With every inhale, would be this blood curdling snarl. He jumps down off the couch in front of me. Never once taking his eyes off this certain spot. He's in protective mode. He's taking a few steps forward, barking, then backing up, keeping himself directly in between me and this spot. He jumps back onto my lap, trembling and snarling, eyes still glued to the wall. By this time, I am trying to comfort him. Trying to calm him down. Everytime my fingertips would touch him, he would jump out of his skin. He nearly bit me one time, out of sheer reaction and fear. He jumps off the couch and runs through our left entrance into the kitchen, which is right beside where we were sitting. He runs through the kitchen growling, and he stops right before the right entrance. The entrance that is only a few inches from where he's been fixated on.

 To this day, I do not know what happened, but I can hear his nails on the floor, slowly approaching the right entrance. Complete silence for a few seconds, and then he let\'s out a very loud yelp, runs back through the kitchen, back through the left entrance, and into my lap. I have never seen an animal so terrified in my life. In my mind, I am thinking, what if it's a snake or a rat. I search for over an hour, looking for any signs of what might have scared him like that. I exam him to make sure something didn't bite him. Came up with absolutely nothing.

 He is no longer looking at the wall at this time. Other than occasional glances. It was the confirmation that I needed. The following day, I asked it to leave my house, and that it was no longer welcomed here.

 I never thought I would experience anything like that, but I am one of the few lucky ones that have. I am now a firm believer in animals seeing what we cannot. Since asking it to leave, we have not experienced any more encounters. I am thankful nothing bad happened during our experiences, and I was able to teach my children how to respect a spirit. A memory that will forever live with my family."
"The Back Room","California","Haunted Places","When I was a preschooler, we moved to a shadowy house surrounded by a creek. Bay trees grew close, hugging the house and making the rooms darker. The front of the house contained a main living room with a wood stove and two bedrooms that were very small. Down a small step was the kitchen. Off of that was a small hallway with a bathroom and the back bedroom. It was the largest room in the house and that is where my parents put me. 

As soon as I was settled in, things began to happen. At first they were small things, an uneasiness making it difficult to play alone. I started to have nightmares that left me shaking and screaming for my dad. 

As the time went by, I began to see shadows that writhed across the floor, along the baseboards, or on the ceiling along the walls. I was afraid at night.

One night I woke from a nightmare to see two perfect balls of light that danced independently from one another. They floated down by my bed and lined up on the wall like a pair of eyes, looking at me. I was so scared, I put my head under the covers. Soon I had trouble breathing from being stuck under the blankets, so I very carefully reached my hand out to create a hole in the blankets so I could breathe. Eventually, I fell asleep that way. 

Another time, I woke and found a stain-like shadow on the wall that appeared to be some kind of animal face. Once again, I flung the covers over my head. The next day the mark was gone. I didn't see it again, but I did see the balls of light, over and over. 

Things got worse. A sudden pounding would occur, coming from the ceiling at the corner of the room. There was an apartment over my room, locked with no-one living in it. I wonder if it came from there. Amorphous forms, white and twisted flowed down from the ceiling when it happened. I wondered why my parents never heard the noises. 

The covers on my bed were thrown off, at times. I began to wind them around my body to keep them in place and I do that to this day. 

I tried to tell my parents, but they never believed me. 

 The events happened until I was eight and I was moved into my brother's room at the front of the house. Soon, we moved away.

I visited the house years later as an adult, bringing my husband with me. It was a home daycare and newly remodeled. A little girl slept in the back room. I asked the owner if she was comfortable in the house and she said yes. 

To this day I have no idea what it was that tormented me. I have seen things and experienced things I can't explain, but nothing as horrible as that time period in my life."
"A Stalking White Spirit, What Is It?","Arkansas","Haunted Places","Recently, there's been some strange phenomenon happening after I moved with my father to a different state. All the time in many homes I've been in, there's always something happening, but I didn't expect it to follow me from state to state. I have enough on my plate as is, and I feel that this entity is making it all the worse. Thee details I am about to provide are from months and months of activity, I hope that someone will have an explanation on what this could be, and how to potentially get rid of this spirit.

Almost always, there's something keeping me up at night. But lately, it's been at its peak. Constantly, I keep hearing endless noises. Walking outside my window, a knocking on the window that continues every few minutes. But when I look, nothing. I thought it could be someone messing with me, or just me hallucinating, but now... I believe it's something more. The television keeps turning on by itself when I'm not in the room, and my father and I have recently been seeing the same figure, over and over again. It's white, but the face is as black as coal. But before getting a clear look, it always vanishes as quickly as it appeared. I haven't had much rest, and lately I've been throwing tantrums for seemingly no reason, I even lost control of myself and caused a lot of mayhem and pain, and laughed in the face of everyone as I did so. I think this spirit is following me, and is making itself known on purpose. Is it trying to mess with my head? That's likely. But what sort of spirit is it?

Even now, I usually see it peering through the windows. And the more I acknowledge it, the more frequent it seems to get. As I was walking around, my father said he could see it following me wherever I go. So now I'm suspicious if it's mainly after me. I do a lot of demonic research, and have had a history of demonic activities that I've done. But those were long ago.

We tried to contact this spirit, which I'm not sure if what we got was entirely accurate but it definitely has made me discover a few things. It led us to a shed outside, which is pretty much abandoned as no one uses it. It told us of a book, and as we searched, we came across an old, personal Bible. It looked to be many of many years old, and I never noticed it there before as I've been to the shed a few times. My father and I came to the conclusion that the spirit we contacted wanted it out. So, I decided to grab it, and took it outside and into the garage where it now lies. But, now, I feel I've made an error. Maybe that Bible was in there for a reason. I don't know. I'm not very religious but am willing to hear what anyone else thinks. Ever since I moved it, activity increased.

Sometimes I can't sleep in my room, as activity happens in there too. Whispering, bed shaking, screaming even. So, anything would be much appreciated. Thank you for your time reading this, and I'm going to keep up to date with what anyone else has to say. (or at least try to as soon as possible) 

I would appreciate any sort of advice."
"It Follows...always","New Jersey","Haunted Places","I don't have anyone to turn to. Everyone who experienced the following events with me, laugh it off as nothing, or disregard the events as a whole. 

 It started off when my grandparents first purchased their house, the year I was born, well, a few months before to be exact. Due to my parents not being able to find an apartment I lived in that house until the approximate age of two. 

 I have no recollection of my early years there. I go off testimony when I say that the entity that resided in said house, developed a connection with me. My uncles, aunts, and parents claimed that the paranormal occurrences would center around me. My swing would move on its own, and would continue to play music, after the batteries were taken out. I would wake up late at night and point to nothing and say something was there. The worst part is all these incidents occured in the basement, because that is where my parents and I would sleep.

 Long story short, we ended up moving away. My parents and I moved three hours away, but for some reason I always found myself back inside that house. 

 At 6 or 7 we moved back. The neighborhood was peaceful and the house looked quite nice. The sun was bright and always peered its way in through the windows of the house, but as a kid I would sit in the main living room and it would feel dark. It would feel evil.

 A few months ago, I was sitting in the main living room. I looked out the window and saw a tall figure looking back at me. Wearing all black, with an expressionless face. I turned for a second to tell my brother to look, and when I turned back it was gone.

 I moved away a few weeks later, happy to be out of the house. In my new house (a 45 minute drive away from my grandparent's house), weird stuff has begun happening. I hear voices at night. My bedroom door opens at night all the way, to reveal no one there. It has gotten so bad that I now wear headphones to sleep, to block the voices, and lock my room door at night, so it won't open. It seems to be working, but I don't know for how much longer. 

 It follows me. I know it's here. If you guys want more in depth stories about individual incidents please tell me in the comments. Also give me any advice. 

Thanks for reading!"
"Ghostly Revenge","California","Family / Friends Visits","This house was located in Ontario California. We bought it a few months before my first son was born. I worked in an electronic assembly company. 

My co workers and I would tease a lady named Pearl who also worked there about her chain smoking. 

I quit work when my son was born in July. One of my co-workers that I kept in contact with, asked me to come see her, and she wanted to see the baby. 

While talking to her she mentioned that Pearl had passed away.

A few nights later, I started feeling that someone was sitting on my legs while I was in bed. 

I didn't think much about it.

But one night my son was restless, and kept crying. I was up several times trying to get him back to sleep.

I gave him a bottle, setting the cap on the bed in his room. I was walking around, finally getting him to sleep. While walking around, I kept feeling a poking in the middle of my back. I reached back a few times thinking my back was twitching. 

The last time I felt the poking, the bottle cap dropped into my hand. 

I was freaked out, put my son back in his crib, and set the bottle on my husband's nightstand in our bedroom with the cap on it. 

He asked me what I was doing.

I told him what happened. He didn't believe me, and said that I was just tired.

A minute later we heard a sound down the hallway.

We turned on the light, and noticed the bottle cap was at the end of the hallway.

We decided it might be the spirit of Pearl getting a little revenge for all the teasing we gave her in life.

Next day we said out loud, "" Come on Pearl, get in the car"" 

We drove down the freeway, pulling off the freeway, we told her to get out, and believe it or not, that was the end of the haunting."
"Toy That Turns To Stare At You","Colorado","Haunted Items","When I was in fifth grade me and my friends Sadie and Abby really liked the show My Little Pony. At the time our school was having a book fair and one of the books came with a little pony figurine. Abby ended up buying it. Sadie and I would always beg her for it because we collected those pony toys, but she always said no and was persistent to keep it. 

 Over probably a couple weeks (I don't remember how long) Abby gave the toy to Sadie out of the blue. After a few days Sadie started telling me the pony toy is possessed. She claimed it would turn and face her and it only happened at night. She said she lined up all the ponies she collected on her dresser facing the wall. She left the room and as soon as she exited the doorway she turned around because she forgot something and all the pony toys were facing directly at her. In my mind I didn't believe her at all but I went along with it so maybe she'd let me have it for a night and see for myself. I asked her exactly that and the next day she brought it to me. 

 When I got home it was around dusk I put the pony toy and some of mine that I had on a shelf in the bathroom. I made note of where each one was facing. One facing the bathtub, one facing the wall, one facing behind the bathroom door, and one facing the corner of the room. I decided the use the bathroom. I got up and left the room, but as soon as I got through the doorway I turned around because I forgot to wash my hands and they were all staring directly at me as if someone moved them. I ran to tell my mom and she got mad at me for bringing something like that in the house without telling her. She decided to put it in a container with salt and threw it away.

 The next day I told Sadie what happened and asked her what she think caused it. She said she thinks it's because her and Abby were having a sleepover and were trying to summon ghosts, a few days later Abby gave the toy to her. I asked her what they did she said they ""put books together and said an ancient chant"" they found on the internet. She wouldn't elaborate more and didn't remember what the chant was."
"My Home Of Paranormal Activity","Minnesota","Haunted Places","Shortly after turning in for the night, dog sleeping by the nightstand, I go through my email and check my online buying and selling sales. While doing so, the increased depth and volume of breathing from the dog got my attention. It was unusual. But I continued my business. 

A few minutes later, again, I heard the breathing, it was getting louder... Or closer, or both. 

Now it has my undivided attention. Why? Because I was hearing three breathing; me, the dog and something else. 

The room is dark except for the light of my phone. The third breathing I hear is at the foot of my bed. It's a normal breathing rate. Not heavy, not deep. I look to the nightstand and my dog is sound asleep. 

Now I ask myself if I'm dreaming or if this is really happening. So, I pinch, slap and punch myself. I'm not dreaming. 

So, I hold my breath and count the number breathing again. I hear two. There should only be the dog breathing. I do it a second time with the same results. All the while whatever this is, it's going around the side of the bed, moving up the side, getting closer.

I look to the nightstand again to be sure it's not the dog. He's still sleeping.

Again, I pinch, slap and punch myself. It's not a dream. 

Now I start talking to this Anomaly or Entity. Whatever it is. Under my breath, I tell it to shut up. The breathing continues. Talking to something you can't see or feel, yet sounds like a person. Under my breath, I tell it to shut up again. It continues. Try to imagine it.

Now it is standing at the side of my bed. I reach to feel if something is there. Nothing. I can't see it or feel it. My mind is racing. 

I tell it to SHUT UP! Speaking louder. I'm asking myself ""What more can I do?"" I repeat speaking even louder, SHUUUTT UUUPPP! Still nothing. 

Now the breathing is 12 inches from my ear. I still can't see or feel it.

Now I tell it to shut up same as the last time. This time adding profanity. 

Well, it finally stopped. 

What was it? Well, prior to this, there were things happening such things as doors closing, faucets turned on, cameras being bumped during filming and an astronomical number of orbs in the living room, most coming out of or going up the fireplace flue. Some have said this townhouse to be a portal. The most interesting are five phenomenons; 1) Granddaughter communicated with the spirit of a little girl; 2) My Ex-wife's grandmother was trying to communicate with me; 3) The Central Air was turned off on one of the hottest summer days; 4) The dog was growling and barking at something I couldn't see; and 5) a black mass. 

I don't know whose or what spirit was next to me that night or what would have happened if I hadn't told it to shut up. Nothing happened after that that I'm aware of. I do know it was a phenomenal experience. 

I had incidents at the apartment I just moved out of too. That's a whole different story."
"Paranormal Experiences At My Grandma's House","California","Haunted Places","When I was born, I lived with my dad, mom and grandma in my grandma's house in Chowchilla, CA. This town is notorious for gangs, shootings, and plenty of ""crazies"" as the locals called them. This story is not about them, but I figured I should establish that first. I will be writing in this account of several experiences, some of which were simply relayed to me as I was too young when they happened to clearly remember them now.

#1 

I was roughly three or four months old when this happened to me. My dad and mom were outside in the carport, smoking. They had a baby monitor to keep track of me, because I was asleep in the house in their bedroom in my crib. My dad told me that the baby monitor was silent, when suddenly both him and my mom heard someone speaking in some sort of demonic tongue. My dad rushed inside to threaten whatever intruder was in the room, but found no one there. He heard muffled cries from where I was in the crib and ran to check on me. I was suffocating. I was wearing a beanie because that room never really got warm, and the beanie was pulled over my mouth and nose and was being held there forcefully. I was wearing little mittens, and at that age did not have the strength to pull that beanie down so hard, and with the mittens on couldn't even grasp anything properly. My dad says he wrenched the beanie off of my head and I started breathing erratically, finally able to breathe after being slowly suffocated for an unknown amount of time. 

#2

When I was a little older, maybe three and a half or close to 4, I began to speak and play with an unseen person in the house. At first this was chalked up to an imaginary friend, but that changed when my grandma, dad, and mom saw her briefly when she and I were playing peekaboo. This girl was not much older than I was at the time, she was maybe around six or seven years old. To this day I can still remember exactly how she looked. She was a small girl, with curly blonde hair, wearing a long yellow dress that was embroidered with little red roses all over it. I remember her being sweet, but she got upset when I played with my younger brother and not her. When I was nearly five years old, my mom, brother and I moved away to Kansas, because my dad was arrested for domestic violence against my mom. For several years, I lived away from my grandma's home, living in Kansas and Missouri, before finally moving back to stay with my dad, grandma and brother again, while my mom stayed in Kansas trying to better herself.

 For the first few months back in the home I had almost forgotten the little ghost girl, until one night when suddenly I remembered her name and all the memories came flooding back. Her name had been Sarah. I started to see her again after that, but she didn't talk to me or play with me. At first I figured it was because I was older now, but I was only around 8 years old. I finally figured out that she was mad at me for leaving her alone for several years. I spent several hours talking to the air trying to explain to her what had happened, but I never got a response and I honestly don't even know if she was listening. But, some time after that she appeared to other people in the house.

 I had a step-sister who was about four or five at the time, and she slept on the couch in the living room. She was small, with straight blond hair. I was in the kitchen one night and I heard my dad angrily yell at my little sister to ""get the f*ck back to bed."" Curious, I looked to the living room and saw my sister passed out on the couch, just like she had been for hours. I went down the hall to tell this to my dad, fully aware that he would probably yell at me, and he just had this shocked look on his face. He was staring into the empty laundry room, that had the washer and dryer and some clothes but nothing else. My dad whispered to me ""I saw her"", and when I replied with a confused look, my dad explained how he had seen a little blonde girl run from the bathroom (one side of the hall) to the laundry room (just opposite of the bathroom) from where he was sitting in his room at the end of the hall. He said he yelled, thinking it was my sister, and had gotten up to punish her, but when he looked in the laundry room where the girl had ran, there had been no one there. My dad said he remembered that I used to play games with a little girl when I was younger, who looked just the same as what he had saw. My dad went back to bed and we didn't talk about the incident for a long time.

#3

I was about ten when some sort of spirit decided to take residence in my bedroom, bothering me and disrupting my things often. I had a ceiling fan that I couldn't get to turn on, and one of those light fixtures with exposed bulbs with a kind of flower shaped glass case around them that didn't close. My dad was very abusive, so I spent a lot of time in my bedroom with the door locked, eating cereal straight out of the box. When I did leave my room, I always turned off my light and shut the door, even if I was only leaving for a moment. One day, I left my room to grab a new box of cereal out of the cupboard. I was walking back to my room, and I heard nothing out of the ordinary, but noticed that the light was shining from under the door. I thought this was odd, but it wasn't nearly as odd as what I saw when I opened the door. I saw my fan on at full speed, shaking the light fixture, I saw that the glass around one of the bulbs was smashed off and in three pieces on the ground, but the bulb was untouched. All four of the bulbs were on, even though I had believed one of them to be out. I immediately ran to get my dad and he cleaned up the glass and turned everything off. 

That house was just recently left by my grandma who moved away, and I don't know if it's been bought yet, but as far as I know that light fixture is still broken.

 A different time, I had bought a kit to make ""shrinky-dinks"" which involved coloring large drawings on wax paper and then baking the paper so that you had little charms that were shrunk. Since I had that kit, and generally left my room a mess, I had a large stack of wax paper sheets on my desk. One night I was staying up late reading a book (I have insomnia and am now medicated for it) when suddenly the stack of papers flies off of the desk and briefly around my room before scattering. Truth being told this scared the shiat out of me, but I was used to being abused and threatened so I didn't scream but merely gasped with shock. My window had been shut for a long time, because the screen was missing, and my fan wasn't on. I thought maybe it was the heater or air conditioning, but neither of those gave off strong enough blasts to do what happened that night.

 About a month later, I was exiting my room when a mason jar full of pencils and pens and paintbrushes flew past my head and broke against the door frame beside me. That time I did scream, but I was the only one home, since my grandma was at church and my dad was off doing god knows what, and my little brother and sister were at my (at the time) stepmoms house. I also had two experiences of what I thought was sleep paralysis while sleeping in that room, but I don't know what really happened, or if it was even real. 

#4

This will be the last story for now, but I will write about more of my experiences at some point. When I was around four, before me and my mom and brother moved away, I slept most nights in a small bed in my mom and dad's room next to their bed. I woke up one night, sobbing, to find my dad next to me trying to wake me up, saying I had been having a nightmare. The problem was resolved and that night I slept in the bed with my parents. The next morning when we awoke, we found above my little bed on the ground three deep gashes in the wall, as if something had tried to claw at it. It frightened my parents and me greatly. We tried several times to get rid of the gashes, plastering over them, painting over them, putting posters over top of them. But, they always came back. The plaster was always just not where the gashes were, no matter how many coats of paint we put we could always see the gashes, and every poster we tacked or nailed over it was found on the ground hours later with the nails or tacks beside it.

 When I returned to the house after living in Kansas and Missouri, around four years later, the gashes still remained in the wall. A few months later, my grandma had the house renovated, so we had to stay in a rental house for a couple months one summer. When we went back to the house we found the gashes to be gone, and we were relieved. Then, we were told that that entire wall was removed and replaced, and we were no longer relieved. It took completely removing the wall to get rid of those horrible gashes."
"Doctor Office Ghosts","Texas","Haunted Places","I work in a pediatric doctor office and we have several paintings on our walls from sick kids from the children's hospital we are associated with. Quite a few of us here have had several experiences. Some of my coworkers have had little cards go flying off of the counters with no wind around or AC to blow them off. Sometimes the bell for our doors will chime when I am the only one here or whenever one of the docs is here alone. We will usually say something like, ""Hello, who's there?"" only to get no reply because we are alone in the clinic. 

 I have had a few experiences. Often, I will feel watched here. It is a strange feeling when you are alone and you walk out the bathroom you SWEAR you locked only to find it unlocked and like you are walking into a fishbowl or something being examined or watched... As soon as this happened I grabbed all of my stuff and started walking out of the front door. I heard one of the exam doors slam closed as I was leaving. I did not go and investigate. 

 Recently, my coworker approached me and told me that a painting fell off the wall. I went over there and fixed it. There are a lot of these paintings from sick kids on our walls. So we go behind the desk and then boom something falls off the wall. She was too scared to go out there, so I did. And the painting right next to it was on the ground. It was never touched or moved in any way at all.

 I don't know much about this building other than it has been here for quite some time. It was an OBGYN before it was a pedi office about 8-9 years ago. Before that, I am not sure. It is definitely not the newest office. 

If anyone has any idea what kind of ghost this could be I am open to any suggestions! My manager thinks it is related to the paintings and that maybe one of them belonged to a child who passed away. Just her theory. A previous employee swore up and down she could see a little boy in here. I know that one of my coworkers came in early because she was expecting a friend to come so she could complete their blood work that morning. She kept hearing the door jiggle like someone is pulling on it. There is a silver bar in the front of the door to push and pull the door open and closed. She went up to the front 3 times and no one was there. Another time, same coworker came early, was the only one here, heard a loud crash and stayed in her office until someone else got there. When she went to see what was broken if anything... NOTHING was out of place. CREEPY! Thanks everyone."
"Ghost Of El Tropicano","Texas","Haunted Places","This past summer, my family and I (husband and 2 kids 8 year old at the time and a 6 month old) traveled to San Antonio for a weekend little vacation. I picked the el Tropicano on the Riverwalk because it looked nice online, and I got a really good deal booking at one of those online sites. When I booked it, I didn't really think of anything other than that I got a really good deal.

 A few days before I,of course, did some looking up online to see if we were staying at a haunted place because I have always loved ghost stories, the paranormal, etc... It is just an interest of mine although I haven't had many experiences except for the doctor office I currently work for they say is haunted and some things have happened here but that is for another time... 

 I found online a story about this man in a black hat that roams the halls of the 3rd floor. This was on some blog so who knows if its even accurate? Lol

 We check into this hotel, when we get there it looks a lot older than the pictures online. We get our room keys; luckily the in laws decided to come as well. Of course they have no problems.

 I think I felt things because I am very open minded. When we got to our small room, it didn't smell weird but it felt off to me. I felt like I was intruding on someone else's space. 

In the shower, there were several tiny little lights above the sink on the ceiling and also scattered around the bathroom. I should have taken a picture. Whenever I went into the bathroom, one light would flicker off. I could feel someone in there with me, but I could not see them. This did not happen to my husband or son when they showered or anything. My eyes would be closed, rinsing soap out of my hair and the one light would flicker off, then back on several minutes later. It made me so nervous, the 3rd or fourth time that I made my husband stand in there while I showered. It never ever went off when he was in the room. He just kept saying ""oh it's just faulty wiring it probably won't happen again."" This happened to me like 10 times when we were there.

 We stayed 2 nights. On the first night sleeping I felt like I was being watched the whole night. It was horrible. Everyone slept like a log except me. The second night, I slept better but the next day when I woke up my stomach out of the blue started acting up. I have some stomach probs but I mean this was like nothing before it was severe. My husband then got a weird cramping like in the creases by the groin area. At that point I was like ""you know what, we aren't wanted here, we are invading someone's space, we need to leave NOW."" We got all of our stuff and left in a hurry. Plus we were trying to get to the waterpark early.

 Anyways, when I went to the checkout counter to give my room cards, I asked them what's up with the 3rd floor... Is it haunted? They said that they have never had any experiences themselves, but that they have heard the 3rd floor is haunted. That's all she could tell me... It was really odd and we will never go back... And I understand now that when you get a ""good deal"" online they are really giving you the rooms no one else wants, rookie mistake I guess. I know that San Antonio near the Riverwalk especially is known for its history and hauntings especially because of the Alamo.

 Has anyone been to this hotel and had a similar experience? I would love to hear about it! Thanks in advance."
"New House With A Visitor","Florida","Haunted Places","We recently bought a house in a small town in Florida. It's a retirement lake community that most folks have bought into as Winter getaway homes. Others live here all year round and everyone is like one big family.

We were aware that someone had died in our home but that hadn't bothered us. The house felt light and empty even though it was full of it's previous owners belongings. My dog and birds felt very comfortable in their new home.

We quickly donated the furnishings, knickknacks, paintings and mirrors and only held onto a few things.

Renovations went smoothly and the place is really looking beautiful. I'm so proud of our accomplishments in such a short time. 

The holidays came and we didn't have a tree so we used the old tree that came with the house. It was so big and beautiful. I thought I had given away all of their Christmas stuff but I found a box of ornaments that helped fill in the empty spots on the tree. I couldn't believe I didn't have enough ornaments!

We started to hear sounds coming from the kitchen around the time the tree went up. Weird sounds that we couldn't explain. My husband checked the refrigerator, the electricity, everything and anything that could be making these noises only when we are in another room. 

My dog and birds started to get upset by the noises too and it was throwing our whole house off balance.

We did our best to just ignore it. 

News Years was approaching and in our big Italian Family that means clean every inch of your home and throw out what you don't want or need. 

I found this collection of lighthouses that I thought were really cute. Normally I would throw out something that belonged to someone that died but we have this big shelf across this doorway and I felt like they belonged there.

Now to the visitor part!

Last night I was alone with my dog because my husband was working the night shift. I tried to put her to bed at her regular time but she kept barking and running into the kitchen. It seemed like she was seeing something that I couldn't see. She finally calmed and I went to bed.

I was watching TV in bed for an hour or so when all of a sudden something very heavy got into my bed next to me! I was terrified! I quickly turned around and of course no one was there! I turned on all the lights and said the Lord's Prayer. 

This isn't my first Tango with a ghost, just my latest."
"6611","Pennsylvania","Haunted Places","I've lived in a small town all my life. It was always quiet, never any commotion. Cops rarely ever visited it. There was a decent sized house on the corner of our turn to our house. It was a medium sized red house, it had a back indoor porch, 4-5 bedrooms, one kitchen, 2 living rooms and one bathroom. Nobody lived there, whoever lived there last randomly up and left, and the house became foreclosed. Whoever lived there last left many of their belongings. I always enjoyed going there alone, especially when it had rained. I felt like I had a connection to the house. I tended to go there when I was sad.

 One dark, quiet night, me and my sister decided to take my friend there. We didn't go inside because when we got there, we started recording. We didn't notice anything out of the ordinary until we got back to my house, when we watched the videos we took. What we saw was amazing, it seemed to be the shadow of an older lady with a hat on, watching us at the door for a split second and then moved away. This isn't much of a story, but man we were afraid for a while.

 I still continued to go back, though. For a while I was convinced there was a ghost living there. I haven't gone back for quite a while because someone bought it and is fixing it up. I'd always collect little things from the house every time I'd go, like once when I went I saw a notice on the door that was for the people who left that said they had 30 days to get their stuff out, or the house would be cleared out and everything inside would be trashed. After I stopped going, for a while I'd see random black shadows follow me. It stopped after a while. I often still wonder if there was actually a ghost living there, and wondered why the people just up and left. I called this article ""6611"" because these numbers were the house's address."
"Highlands Haunting","Kentucky","Haunted Places","When I was 20 I moved into my first apartment, which was in an older home in the Highlands area of Louisville. It was a beautiful home, and the rent was super affordable for the area. Despite sensing a feeling of a presence during the walk through I was still excited to move in. It didn't take long for paranormal activity to start. One evening my room mate and I were hanging out in the living room and all of a sudden a picture frame and books flew off the built-in bookshelf next to us, as if they were pushed off. I think it's important to note that these were very deep built-in shelves, if the frame and books had just fallen over it would have still been in the shelf. We just looked at each other, completely in shock of what had just happened and trying to rationalize how it could have happened, but knew unless they were pushed they wouldn't have flown off the shelf the way they did. 

The next occurance happened when I was in the shower. I saw a tall, dark figure walk past the shower door and assumed it was my roommate since he was tall and work uniform was black. I started talking to him, but got no response, and didn't see anyone pass by again. When I got out of the shower I went around to the other side of the bathroom to the sink/vanity area and said ""hello, did you hear me?"" only to come around the corner and find no one there. I looked in the adjoining closet, still nothing. At this point I was feeling scared. I called my room mate and asked if he had just been home and had come in the bathroom. His reply was, ""I've been here at work all day, I won't be home until tonight"". I remember hanging up, getting dressed as quickly as possible and leaving the house and calling my room mate back to tell him what happened and to call me when he gets home because I didn't want to be there alone. 

A few weeks later I was just waking up and laying in bed, when the bedroom door slammed shut. It was slammed with such force that I was stunned. I thought it had to be my room mate or maybe one of our friends had spent the night and thought it would be funny. I went straight to his room and found it empty. I went to every room of the house-empty. I looked outside and my room mates car wasn't outside anywhere. I called him, asking if he had been home and had slammed my door shut. He replied that he had gone out after his closing shift the night before and crashed at one of our friend's houses. I was so terrified that I literally grabbed my car keys and ran out of the house in my pajamas, and drove to my college campus. I sat in the library all day until my room mate got home. He was in shock that something else had happened. From then on we started sleeping downstairs in the living room and neither one of us would be there alone. 

Hoping to get some answers, we approached the landlord and asked if any other tenants had experienced activity like we were experiencing. She was very short in her replies and wouln't give a direct answer. Next, we contacted the Kentucky Ghost Hunters Society for help. We only told them we had been having activity, and they sent paranormal investigators and a medium. As soon as the medium walked up the stairs towards my bedroom they stopped and said ""there is a dark figure standing in the door of that room, it is not a good spirit"". I left at that point due to feeling overwhelmed by what was happening. The medium also detected the spirit of a child around the age of 5, and the spirit of a man who was not a threatening entity, but just walked circles around my room mates room. They said if we were to experience mischevious things, such as items falling over or things moving, it was most likely the spirit of the child. My room mate and I looked at each other and then told the medium about the items on the book shelf. The entity focused in my bedroom was the one they were most concerned about, and they communicated they feared it may be demonic and didn't want to leave. Naturally, I opted to move out shortly after. In the process of packing, I turned to set a box in the hallway, and as I did I stepped into a misty white cloud the dissapeared as quickly as it appeared (it was like someone clapped chalk board erasers together). I didn't feel threatened by it, just confused as to what I had just walked into. 

On my last day in the apartment, my mom came over to help me clean. When it started to get late, she told me to go on back to their house since I had a test in the morning, and that she would finish mopping the stairs. It wasn't long after I got home that she came home. I remember her face was pale and she looked scared. When I asked what was wrong she said she had been mopping the stairs and heard someone pacing back and forth in the bedroom above her. Knowing my room mate had already moved out and she was the only one there, she left as quick as she could. I remember her telling me, "" I don't know how you lived there"". To this day, I don't know how I did either. Though 12 years have passed, I still get the chills when I talk about the experiences I had in that apartment."
"Peek-a-boo","California","Haunted Places","I lived with my parents at the time that this happened. We had a nice home, I loved the kitchen. We had a bar separating the kitchen from the living room, and I would sit there everyday and do my homework there.

I'm also a total night owl. So I went into the kitchen one night, really late. I was making myself a sandwich on the counter next to the sink, so I had my back turned to the bar. When I turned around, I clearly saw something ducking under the bar. Now, I have three brothers, and their favorite pastime is trying to scare me. So I assumed that one of my brothers was trying to scare me when they saw me go into the kitchen. I froze, and slowly moved closer to the bar, wanting to scare them before they scared me. So turned the corner slightly, and I didn't see anyone. The bar was curved, so I just thought they were further down. That's when I decided to jump out and scare them. So I did just that. Only to realize that there was no one there.

I froze again, but this time I had the chills. If you've read my other stories you know these events don't really scare me, but I still get the chills sometimes. 

I knew this was another paranormal experience I was having, and just went back into the kitchen to finish making my sandwich. I hurried up, put everything away as fast as I could, and left to my room. The next day I told my mom what happened, and she looked at me in disbelief. She told me that the exact same thing had happened to her, but she's not really a believer, so she hadn't told anyone. She also thought it had been one of my brothers, or me."
"Who Was In The Car?","North Carolina","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","This happened to me about 5 years ago, in 2013, and I still am baffled by it.

 I was on my way to work early in the morning, around 6:30, so it was still dark. As I rounded a corner on my road, I came upon a car stopped in the middle of the road. I halted behind it for a moment, before realizing that they must have been having issues, so I drove around it to the left. As I passed the car, I noticed an old man in the drivers seat. He was balding, dressed in what looked like a white sweater, and was hunched over.

 I drove up the road for about half a mile when guilt got the better of me. What is this older gentleman didn't have a cell phone to call for help? So I found a spot to turn around and headed back to the vehicle. 

 When I arrived at the spot, I was immediately confused. The elderly man was no where to be found, but there was a middle-aged man standing outside of the car, attempting to call someone on his cell phone. THIS man had dark hair, was in his late 30's or so, and looked NOTHING like the older man I'd seen in the vehicle earlier. I rolled down the window, and asked if he needed assistance. The man kindly replied that he was visiting a friend and had gotten lost, running out of gas in the process. I directed him to the nearest gas station, and he stated that his friend was coming to help him out. 

 Before I left, I asked him if he had anyone in the vehicle with him... He replied that he did not. 

 So, just who-or what- did I see in the drivers seat that morning?"
"Money Mysteriously Disappears","California","Haunted Items","For the last 2 years something has been happening to me that I can not seem to quite understand. I get scared every time it happens because I do not know why it has continuously happen to me. Lately my money has been disappearing so mysteriously and it is not someone taking it it's more of a something!

 It all started on the day before my daughter's 2nd birthday party. I had just finished picking out our outfits and came to my parents house to talk about the party I remember settling my purse down at the table in the living room and going to kitchen, but when I was just about to get something out my bag it was gone I lost about $200 that day. I was angry hurt thinking how could my family steal from me the day before my daughters party.

 2 months later I had went to a gas station to pump some gas I clearly remember having my wallet with me and on the way back home I thought about leaving my wallet in my car because of what happened with the incident before. I believed I could not trust my family, but when I went back to the car my wallet was gone. It was not under my seat where I had left it. I thought I forgot it at the gas station but the man had even said he saw me take it. I was devastated but blamed myself. 

Later on I started to carry my wallet with me everywhere I went and settling it down without me in front of it but then money inside my wallet started disappearing. So much of my money has been disappearing almost every paycheck that even my family are starting to think I am forgetful and that I do not know how to take care of my money, but it is not that. Something is taking my money and I do not know why.

 I've came to conclusion that it is not my family who is taking from me nor my friends because even when I am alone it is still GONE! I have direct deposit now but every time I pull out cash I would not be able too because this something keeps taking it away from me and I just want to understand why is it doing it to me!

 I have lost my debit card recently and this year has been a rough year for me I had lost my debit card and cashed my check out. I put in a lot of hours and sacrifice a lot of my time. I counted my money and put the money in my wallet and hid it in the glove department, $750 was in my wallet. I must admit I was afraid to leave my wallet but did not want to think too much of it and just be positive; however, the next morning I woke up and got dressed to go to work I arrived and thought about grabbing a snack before I started my day I was so nervous about getting my wallet because I was afraid that it was going to happen again. I reach for the glove department grab my wallet and I noticed how light it was, I shed a tear and opened it to only find $15!

 I keep thinking about what I have done for a spirit to keep doing this to me why the fact that it is only happening to me and why not anyone else that I know! Someone please help me I've encountered this way too many times that I want it to stop I don't know who to pray to or what to believe. Someone please give me some advice I cannot keep up with this any longer!"
"The Shadowman From Hell","Ohio","Shadow People","In the old days, we spent our evenings as a family parked in front of our old black and white TV set. There were only four channels back then: 3, 13, 8, and PBS. Being down in the hills, we could only pick up two: 3 and 13. If atmospheric conditions were just right, and they seldom were, we could pull in a very snowy channel 8.

On this particular night, sometime around 1967' or '68, me and my brother were in our usual places sprawled out on the living room floor in front of the boob tube. Dad was lying on the couch, and mom was in her favourite chair.

While we were watching TV, I remembered something I wanted. Unfortunately, it was upstairs - a place that experience had taught me to avoid at all costs on my own at night.

Whatever it was that I wanted, the desire for it was strong enough that I was willing to risk life and limb to get it. 

So, there I stood at the bottom of the stairway looking up at the vinyl, accordion style door, and debating whether it really was worth the risk.

Finally, I decided to go for it. I carefully slid the door open, hoping with everything in me that the noise wouldn't awake ""Mr. Titus,"" the family ghost. 

Stepping onto the first step, I reached up and turned on the two-way light. I couldn't feel his presence anywhere.

I cautiously walked up a few more steps. He still wasn't there - I was going to be safe!

With a grin like the Cheshire cat, I ran up the rest of the stairs, made the quick U-turn down the hallway to my room. Flipping on the light, I grabbed whatever it was I needed. I stood there for a moment bursting with pride. I was in my room, at night, alone, and I wasn't afraid. I was growing up!

Just as I got to my bedroom doorway, my legs became heavy. I froze in my tracks. My heart began beating like it was going to shoot out of my chest like the creature in Alien. I was suddenly filled with that inexplicable fear that overwhelmed me every time Mr. Titus appeared. But this didn't feel like Mr. Titus. This was something different. This thing wanted to hurt me. I was trapped.

The ghost of Mr. Titus was annoying at best. This thing was new, terrifying, and at the end of the hall, just inside Mom and Dad's room - waiting for me.

All the excitement I had felt about being so brave and growing up was gone. I was terrified. I wasn't used to something invisible wanting to actually hurt me.

I knew I only had three choices, and I didn't like any of them. I could yell for help and listen to my family tell me to stop being stupid, and possibly hear snide remarks from my brother until morning, or I could stay put and risk it coming after me and killing me.

In the end, I decided the best option was to take a chance on beating it to the stairs, and get down before it could hurt me.

It was comical to think I could beat it to the stairs. From my room, I had to run the length of the hallway, make a fast U-turn, and run down the stairs. ""It"" just need to walk two steps and it was there!

I mustered up all the courage I could. Took several deep breaths. Steeled myself. Then bolted down the hall as fast as my trembling little legs could take me. ""It"" was nowhere in sight! I was going to make it!

But just as I was about to make the U-turn, a huge black shadow shaped like a stretching square came out of Mom and Dad's room. It was at least two-thirds of the wall high. I felt as though I was being suffocated by it. As though it were trying to engulf me.

There was no way I could turn back now. I had to force my little shaky legs on. Forcing my way onto the top stairs, I stretched out my arms to brace myself against the walls so I wouldn't fall. Then, I felt a hand on my back. It was pushing me forward. I was missing steps all the way down.

I somehow managed to land on my feet when I landed on the living room floor. I quickly turned around and looked up the stairs. There, at the top, stood Shadowman. We stared at one another for a moment. He had made his point, and he knew it. He slowly turned away and went back into Mom and Dad's room.

This wouldn't be the only time he would push me down the stairs. It happened a lot after that. In time, he must have gotten bored, because he eventually stopped. For which, I'm quite thankful."
"A Voice?","California","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","This story took place on October 31, 2017. This night was one of the most creepiest nights in my life, it was about almost 2 years ago. Before I get into the story I'll give you some history on my house. Before my grandmother got the place an old man lived here, I don't remember his name but the story is that he died in our house. Also my dad said that a little girl died here too. I'm not an easy person to convince, but this night me change my mind.

Like I said it took place on Oct 31,2017. We had just got home from trick or treating (And yes I still do that, thank you very much) My mom had just opened the door and we heard the T.V on but the remote was on top of the coach and our dog as sitting on the chair on the left side, barking her head off. We see what it was playing and my mom yelled something along the lines of '' NOT THIS MOVIE!'' Freddy Cougar was playing on the T.V. She hated that movie.

 My mom rushed to the remote and turned it off static from the T.V filled the room it made my head spin it when on for at least 1 minute or more then it shut off I remember sitting there for almost 5 minutes, not a word came out of my mouth. That's when I heard it, a little girl giggling at the end of my hallway leading into my parents' room. For some reason I began to cry. It was because of all the fear inside me from all the creepy houses or it was something else. I told my sister and my mother what I heard they thought I was lying but I know what I had heard.

Thank you for listening"
"Where Does It Go?","North Carolina","Misc","This is somewhat of a new experience that has now happened twice to me, well that I know of. 

I've shared under someone's submission on here in the past, about my first incident with this prankster I seem to have. So for the people that hasn't read that comment of mine, from about a year ago I believe, here it is.

I forgot when exactly this happened to me, but I know it's been about a year now.

I was getting ready to take a shower one night, and as usual I get all my clothes together that I'll put on afterwards, and lay them on my bed. Since I'm a mother of 3, and my youngest being mischievous, I chose to lock my bedroom door while I took a shower, so I didn't have to worry about my youngest getting into my clothes.

As I finish with my shower, and unlock my bedroom door to get dressed, I noticed when I went to put on my panties, that they were gone. I thought to myself ok, well maybe they just fell on the floor or something, but I couldn't find them. I started to tear apart my bedding, to see if for some crazy reason, they ended up under my covers or pillows (even though I knew that was a far stretch to have happened), but still nothing. I couldn't believe that they just were gone.

I knew I had gathered ALL of my clothes, like I always do when I get ready for a shower. I even knew which pair I had grabbed, and placed with the rest of my clothes, as I laid them on top of all my other clothes.

After giving up, and just grabbing another pair, time went on, and like anyone, I had washed my bedding in this time period, and had cleaned up my room numerous times, but still never came across my missing panties, that was until 3 months later.

It was a weekday morning, and still dark outside, when I had to get my youngest son up and ready for the bus.

After putting him on the bus, I came back home to get a little more sleep, until I had to get my oldest son up and ready for his bus in another hour (one is in elementary school, and the other middle school. So they start an hour apart).

As I started to crawl back into bed, I noticed something laying on top of my pillow. To my surprise, it was my missing panties from 3 months ago! I couldn't believe that it was just on top of my pillow, especially since it wasn't there when I had woken up to get my youngest son ready. 

I laughed to myself saying seriously, now you're finally giving it back to me, and of all places to return it, you lay it on my pillow? I couldn't help but wonder though, during this 3 months period, where does ""ghost"" put our stuff they hide from us? Because I've went all through my bedding, and room during that time, and never found it. So to see it on top of my pillow, knowing that that's not where it has been, makes me wonder where was it? 

Now my second, and most recent incident of missing clothes, happened just yesterday, on December 22nd, 2018. 

Again I was about to take a shower, and again gathered up my clothes to wear, but this time placed them in the guest room, so I could have more privacy in getting dressed and ready to go out afterwards, as my kids were in and out of my room. 

As I'm getting ready to get dressed, and working myself into my pants lol, I went to grab my under shirt (a tank top I like to wear under other shirts/sweaters etc) that I had placed on top of my sweater, but saw it wasn't there.

I immediately thought about my panty incident, but still frantically looked around for where it could have gone to. It wasn't on the floor, or the bed that I had put it on, and again I tore up the bedding to see if for some reason it was there, but again nothing! 

At this point I'm saying out loud, seriously, this is not funny, and I'd appreciate if you'd just give it back to me, as I don't want to wait another 3 months to finally get it back again. 

I walk out the room to tell my husband what happened to me again, and go back to the room to see if it choose to listen to me, and put my top back, but unfortunately it didn't. 

I told my husband how I can't believe this has happened to me twice (well that I know of) now.

I said it's like it's wanting to make me feel crazy, but I knew for a fact that I had grabbed my black tank top, and placed it with my other clothes. I told my husband that at first I couldn't find my top when I was getting my clothes together, so I went and put what I did gather in the other room, and came back to look for my tank top again. When I finally found it, I told him I remember looking at how wrinkly it was, but with it being a tight under shirt, wouldn't matter, and placed it with my other clothes. So I knew I wasn't just thinking I grabbed it, but didn't.

Now it's the day after, and still no top. I told my husband that I'm curious where it will finally pop up this time, since it was in a different room. But again I wonder where does it go? Do ghost have like their own hiding place they hide things? And how many other things has it hidden from me, that I haven't noticed? 

I guess now it's just another waiting game of when and where I will find it. 

Side note: I'd like to add that this happened in my childhood home, that we stay with my mother in. I've said before in I think other comments, how I lost my dad before I was born, and my older brother (only brother, and sibling) when I was 11, and he was 16, to a rare children's disease. So this house has held many pain throughout the years because of our loss. This is also the same home that I had written about ""Something dark"". But I don't believe that the dark thing has came back, nore do I believe that this is something bad. Honestly I've wondered if it could be my brother playing a prank on me, as he was a prankster in life. But I also don't believe that he's a ghost either, so I wonder if spirits can come in other forms, other than being a lost soul? I do feel that my brother crossed over in death, as well as my dad, but think that they still are around me. 

I've had other experiences in this home, that has made me believe this to be true. 

Now I will say that there are times that I feel someone watching me, and have seen things from the corner of my eyes, as well as my husband too. The feeling I get at those times, do not feel like it's my dad or brother. But whatever it is, doesn't bother us at least, more so just watches us. 

This home was built by my family, on our families property, that was once woods, so as far as someone dying in our home, or property, that's a no. 

Hopefully I was able to give out enough details to help understand my experience, and hope to hear any ideas on what y'all believe where our stuff goes, when something hides it?"
"Red Apparition And Other Odd Stories","Pennsylvania","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","These stories all occurred in my childhood home so I will group them together here. 

One of my earliest paranormal memories was of me saying, ""Mom, there is a man in the corner."" 

Just an average looking everyday man. Nothing too distinguishing. He was dark haired. Around 30 years old with a cigarette in his hand. Crouched down in black clothing. Half sitting half standing with his back against the wall.

We had just moved into this home. Our previous home was destroyed by fire. I was very young. I was around pre-school years so somewhere between 3-5 years old. I saw this man in the corner of the living room. He was kind of smirking with a mischievous grin. The impression I had of him was he wasn't that nice. He was very sarcastic looking.

My mom did and still does freak out at the idea of paranormal stuff so she told me to never say that again and if there was a man there it was bad and I shouldn't talk to it or look at it.

I was upset by mom's intense reaction so I closed myself off to seeing the man in the corner. I never saw him again.

A few years later...

My father worked night hours so I usually slept in my mom's bedroom. Their bed was bigger and more comfortable. 

So, one morning I was laying in bed. My mom got up to get dressed and went to the bathroom. I was pretending to be asleep because I didn't want to get up and go to school. I peeked my eye open and saw my cat purring at me. Then I closed my eyes again to pretend I was sleeping. I started thinking about the cat and that it was time to get up and pet her and get her food. My cat kept meowing and I could tell she was walking to the other side of the room by the sound of her meows. I was thinking of petting her.

 All of a sudden I hear my mom shouting, ""Help me Jesus"". She was standing in the doorway praying in a stressful tone. I didn't turn to look at her because my mom is a very religious person and it was common for her to always praying like that so I kind of ignored it. But I could tell she was getting upset. So, finally I turned over and said, ""what is going on""? When I turned over, whatever was there went away. My mom said she saw ""someone"" in the room that looked just like me. In fact, it was me, but wasn't. I was laying in bed but I was also petting the cat on the other side of the room. There were two of me.  The other me who was standing by the cat looked right at her and then faded away. But, the fading away occurred as soon as the real me sat up in bed.

My thoughts are, if it was an out of body experience then why didn't I feel myself leaving my body? Oddly, I was thinking about my cat when the spirit that looked like me was petting the cat. I was imaging very strongly petting the cat. I could see myself doing it in my mind's eye. I felt like I was petting the cat on my fingers. But I knew I was not. I knew I was laying in bed.

Possibly could it be a ""doppelganger""? But do doppelgangers read your minds and do what you will them to do? Are they a connection to you?

Was it a separate entity that pretended to be me?

I'm not really sure what this was. All I know is there were two of me in the same room thinking/doing the same thing at the same time. 

Around the same time frame, my mom's mom (my maternal grandma) died. She was a very cruel person. I don't say this lightly. She did many things in her life that were hurtful to my mom. I understand there were a lot of things out of my grandma's control and she probably did the best she could. But, instead of making amends in this life to my mom for the hurts, Grandma became a very bitter and cruel person. Out of respect for the dead though, I'd rather not elaborate further. 

Anyway, she died suddenly of cancer when I was 8. It took over her body and metastasized quickly. There was only a few days knowledge of her impending death prior to it happening. I'm sure there were plenty of things left unsaid between my mom and her and not enough time for resolutions. 

About three days after the funeral my mom woke up in the middle of the night screaming. I was again sleeping beside her and she woke me up by screaming. I looked up and my mom pointed to the end of the bed to the wall. She said, ""It's my mother and she is in a ring of fire"". I looked and indeed the image of grandma appeared to me as well. There standing, was my grandma, full body, with a very sad forlorn look on her face and she had a red glow and red ring all around her. Redness shot up and down twinkling around her. I didn't see actual fire or flames but there was a redness, like looking through red colored glasses at a person. It had a fluid texture that moved and waved. It didn't appear like a real full three dimensional person but rather like a hologram. The kind of image that was in Star Wars where Princess Leia was asking for help. It was flat and one dimensional as if someone was projecting her onto the wall with redness all around her.  My grandma's voice did say my mom's name but it wasn't coming from her mouth. It was being announced by another source. It called my mom: ""Carol, Carol, Carol"". Then the image blacked away like someone turned it off with a switch.

My mom sobbed herself back to sleep. Not knowing what to say, I went to sleep as well. We never really talked much about it because My mom interpreted it as Grandma being in hell. This is what she believes. She sobbed herself to sleep crying.

I didn't interpret it as such. I didn't think it was hell or a bad place but rather my grandma coming to say she was sorry for what she did to my mom over her life. The redness was her emotional state I felt rather than a place. Kind of like you're so upset that you get an aura around you. My mom never wanted to discuss this as it was and still is too upsetting to her. 

My cousins and relatives came to help my mom clean out Grandma's apartment. Grandma's place was dark and heavy. I'd only been there a few other times. We really weren't much in her life. But the few times I had been there it was always the same. Dark and an oppressive feeling. 

My mom only took a handful of things from the apartment and left the rest. One thing she took was a suitcase. We came home and the adults made dinner. 

My cousins and I were playing with the ""new"" things. A few dresses, necklaces, knick knacks and the suitcase. For some reason, we sat inside the suitcase with the sides open and took photos with an old polaroid camera instant print we had. Just a bunch of goofy kids playing around. When the pictures developed out, every picture we took showed us smiling kids but each one had a weird reddish orange human like face in the background.  We all looked at it and thought it was a spirit or ghost of grandma. It didn't look nice. It didn't look like a double image of one of us goofy kids smiling. It was taller and longer and not smiling. It looked in pain. If anything it looked like a replica of The Scream painting face. We all suggested it was Grandma's face distorted by redness. Or some sort of scary version of grandma.

My mom dismissed it saying it was a double exposure of us kids' faces. The other adults thought the pictures were weird but couldn't explain them.

Hushing the concept of grandma's spirit, my mom threw the pictures away. I'm not sure she really believed it was a double exposure. She was just saying that.

I don't think it was a double exposure. It clearly looked like a face in the photos. A face in anguish and drawn into sadness. Plus, in some pictures it was in the corner. In others it was in the middle of us. Behind us. Etc. It was the same face in all the prints in different positions. 

I believe some souls leave this world and do not rest in peace. I think my Grandma was one of those."
"The Disembodied Whistle","Ohio","Haunted Places","This is a story that happened about 7 months ago. I had recently moved out of my old home to move into my own home. It is the first time I've lived on my own, besides my significant other. Well we had been moving in and out of this house, (my mother was moving too) and I had decided I still needed some of my things out of my old room. I had only a bit left so I figured I'd be in and out. I hadn't realized how unnerving this old house was with no lights and being alone. I walked down the horrifying hallway to my room in the back when I passed my sisters old room, it was creepy but nothing to be concerned about, so I went on my way packing up what little I had left and turning to leave. As I walked down the hallway again passing my sister's old room, I was stopped in my tracks. A disembodied whistle clear as day was coming from her room. It sounded human, not an object but like a person whistling. I was a bit too scared to move as again I was the only person in the house and I was not whistling. Like a deer in headlights I was stuck, my hands holding a full box of my things. I had an old car vacuum in her room that I had still wanted to grab. Yet I changed my mind finally gaining the ability to move. Safe to say I booked it out of that old stinky house, never going back for that vacuum. As far as I see it wasn't worth it, if someone were to be hiding in there my life certainly isn't worth a little handheld vacuum. 

Once I had finally gotten all my things moved into my new home, I had finally settled myself on my couch to relax. It was getting late and I decided to start watching tv. My first night in my own home (before my SO moved in) when I began hearing it once again! That human like whistling. I muted the tv, thinking maybe it was just on the television. Nope the disembodied whistling was still there.

I'm really not sure where else to turn to. I don't know much about spirits, but I do believe in them. No one else can help me. None of my friends have any real suggestions or answers for me either. I just need advice... Clarification maybe? I was honestly frightened to even put my story on blast for others to judge, but at this point I'm vulnerable for an answer. 

Now I did read that dreams aren't really told here, but I need help. I'm not asking for an interpretation, but I'm afraid something has been trying to get to me. I hope this doesn't get taken down because my sleep paralysis has a contributing factor, but it's worth the shot...

I think it all started 7 years ago, I was 11. It was the very first time I had sleep paralysis. I kind of had a little bit of a rough childhood. My earliest memory I have is my father choking my mother out until she fell to the floor. By the age of 7, I was telling my mom to leave my dad. I was afraid of what he might do to her. Long story short, I grew up too fast. My mom finally split from my dad when I was 8. When I turned 11, she got back with him. I begged my mom not to go back to such a terrible man. I hated him, I cannot describe how much hate I had in my heart. When me and my mom moved back in with my dad, I experienced sleep paralysis for the first time. 

At this time, I didn't know what sleep paralysis was. I slept on the couch when I was a child. I woke up in the middle of the night and got a disturbing feeling. I've never felt an emotion like this before. It was like... I wasn't alone? I could feel something watching me. All the lights were off, I looked into the kitchen and saw something crouching on the kitchen counters. My emotions turned to straight fear and shock. Ever since this night, I randomly get an emotional wave come over me like I'm not alone. This was also around the time I gave up on God. 

Freshman year of high school, it was just me and my dad living together in a different house. Another long story short, my mom put me through hell when she split from my dad before high school started. Abuse, drugs, depression. High school was really when the experiences became weird for me. 

I constantly had sleep paralysis. I would wake up and feel something around me, but I couldn't move. I would try to scream to myself to wake up. I had sleep paralysis so much that I got good at hiding my eyes. Every time I would wake up I would feel a presence and sometimes could see something in the corner of my eyes, so I would hide them as fast as my body would wake up so I couldn't look at it. 

But as time goes by, my experiences just get worse.

At 16, I had sleep paralysis and felt something raping me. I had never had sex before, I had never done anything with anyone. I had no idea what THAT felt like, but that night I felt something inside of me. I didn't see it, but I could feel it. I can still feel that memory like it actually happened... This was the occasion that made me discover what sleep paralysis was.

After that, I just felt a stronger presence. I remember one night I was sitting up in bed and felt something touch my back. And I mean REALLY touch my back. The feeling was so real that it made me jump and gasp for breath. I turned around and there was nothing there. Around this time my sleep paralysis experiences just got stronger. I began having it every week, eventually every other day. It became not only just feeling a presence watching me in my room, but eventually I would feel it on top of me. I would feel pressure on me. I got to the point where I would stop breathing and when my body woke up I would have to gasp for air. I would cry every time I had sleep paralysis, I guess because of either not being able to breathe or fear, maybe both. 

It eventually began to choke me. I could feel something around my neck and I couldn't breathe. One occasion I will never forget. I had sleep paralysis and felt a presence around me. I noticed something was going down my throat. I was choking and tried to move my body to pull it out, but I got to the point where I felt myself fainting. I felt my soul begin to leave my body, like I was dying. It was the weirdest, most calm feeling actually. It was like I could just feel my soul slowly fading away. 

Every time I have sleep paralysis the presence just gets closer I think... After all these occasions, I got to the point where I started to believe this was actually SOMETHING real. I tried so hard for so long to believe it was just coincidences, but after so much you can't deny anymore. A couple months ago I hadn't had sleep paralysis in a week or two. I asked, ""If there is something here, give me sleep paralysis tonight."" That night I had the worse sleep paralysis. I woke up and felt the strongest presence I've ever felt. There was something on top of me putting so much pressure on my head. I can't describe the feeling, I'm actually shaking. It was like some current electricity running through my body and there was so much pressure on my head it truly felt like it was going to explode. There was so much pressure that I ended up passing out from it. I heard it trying to whisper to me, but I couldn't hear anything, all I heard was pressure. I didn't just feel pressure I heard the pressure in my head. Since this happened, when I have sleep paralysis I just feel so much pressure on my head that it makes me shake and I just hear pressure... I don't know if that makes any sense.

Ever since this, I believed all my experiences from before were connected together. I think it's been the same thing following me this whole time, but I don't know. I think I try to talk myself out of acknowledging this.

A few days ago, I felt a strange feeling throughout my day. Well, I went to my room and laid in bed. I have Christmas lights above my bed. I felt that weird feeling that I wasn't alone and then part of my Christmas lights that were right above me went out. After a few minutes, my cat started following something around the room. My cat looked everywhere in the room and eventually his eyes stopped right above my head and he didn't move anymore. My cat is the best in the world, I say his name and talk to him all the time and he talks back to me. I say, ""Jiji,"" and he meows. He always pays attention to me. This time when I tried talking to him he would not move away. His eyes were locked there above me where the lights went out a few minutes before. I've had him do this with bugs before, but with bugs he would look away and talk to me. I would even pick him up so he could reach the bug. I looked right above me, I looked everywhere, and there was no bugs there. I had a really bad feeling in my chest, but I tried to block it out and tried to find a reason he was staring at that one spot and wouldn't move. I couldn't find any reason. I got up and went out of my room because I was so uncomfortable with a terrible feeling.

But after what happened to me last night, I'm not sure what to do. This part was not sleep paralysis, this was an actual dream I think. Now, I have bad sleep paralysis, but I rarely have bad dreams. I had multiple dreams I think, but they all connected. And I definitely don't have such weird dreams like this. It felt like I was AWAKE. The details were so real. It was kind of like I was in some slow motion dream. I was in my room and there were no lights on. I got out of bed and walked into the living room and saw a blanket hovering over the couch. I got a strange feeling that something wasn't right and looked back at the blanket and it was completely flat. I realized there was someone under there before, so I ran outside and felt it following me. It then automatically changed to me ending up in someone's basement and there was a boy in a destroyed room. He reached his hand out and I took it. I heard someone yell ""DON'T TAKE HIS HAND THAT'S NOT THE REAL HIM."" I looked over and the boy started screaming a scream that I've never heard before. It shook everything and a door opened to the real boy. The person told me to grab his hand so he could save me, but I couldn't let go of what was holding me. 

I woke up last night and felt something with me. I just could feel whatever it was in there with me, I KNOW THAT FEELING. I couldn't go back to sleep for an hour. I call my boyfriend every single night that I go to sleep. Well I called him so I could feel someone else with me. I heard him say my name, ""Blank."" I said ""what?"" He didn't answer me. I automatically felt something strange. I heard him sleeping, but a little while later I heard him say my name again, ""Blank."" Again, I said ""what?!"" He didn't answer me. I knew, that wasn't him. It was in his voice, but it wasn't HIS VOICE. It sounded nothing like him. It didn't have his tone. It was monotone...quiet...emotionless...and completely awake. I know how my boyfriend sounds, I've been with him for five years. I know every single one of his voices and any tone he has ever had. That was not him. He would never just say my name and then not answer me back. He was asleep. Even if he woke up he wouldn't have sounded so awake like that. He doesn't even say my full name hardly, he says nicknames. I asked him today if he said my name and he said no.

I finally fell back asleep after a whole hour. Now this... I don't know what it was. A dream. Sleep paralysis. Awake. I don't know. I felt like I was awake. There was something hovering over me and whispering in my ear. I mean actually whispering, I could heard the whispering, but I couldn't make out what it was saying to me. I thought it was maybe another dream, but I don't remember waking up this morning after that. 

I've had the worst day. I haven't felt tired in a long time. I mean, I wake up at 7:00 a.m. Even on my weekends, and I'm not tired. I'm an early person. But today, I've been the most tired I've been in probably a year. It's not just emotionally tired, it's physically tired. My body hurts. I've been shaken up all day, I've been feeling that feeling. When I think about what happened today I felt like I was going to pass out. I started to have anxiety a few hours ago and it just feels like the presence is just getting stronger. While typing this my T.V. Has been cutting out. There's NO BAD WEATHER. My T.V. Does not normally cut out like this. I've been seeing things out of the corner of my eye more than normally. I keep hearing thud sounds. I live in the country. My house is in the woods alone. There's not really thudding sounds like this. I mean, I feel presences, I've seen candles move uncontrollably without any wind on it, I've seen things in the corner of my eyes, I've had things move on me, I have weird occurrences with the number 13, but today it just feels out of control. And I feel like it has to do with last night. 

The more time goes by the closer it gets I think. It started out in my sleep paralysis being far away from me, and as the years went by it just gotten closer and closer. I just feel like last night with the connecting (I guess) dreams, the overly emotional feelings, and hearing things when I'm awake is a sign that it's maybe getting worse. I mean, I've had these things happen to me over the years and I've tried to rationalize them, but I don't think this is normal. I don't feel like it's normal. I don't know what it is. I don't know how to rationalize this. 

I'm lost."
"A Very Frightening Encounter With The Grim Reaper!","Texas","Haunted Places","Enchanted Rock State Natural Area spiritual Encounters With The Grim Reaper!

 I guess I should start my story by giving you a short background of my information before I continue. You see all my life I been a witch but suppressed my gifts until the magical year of 2006 when I finally embraced all aspects of what my life is about. As a young child I always had the gift of seeing deceased people and things that were never human at all.

 I also used Ouija boards in my teens to communicate to with the dearly departed but all that changed one fateful night when my older ""Christian"" brother in law barged in my room to let me know dinner was ready and I was in the middle of a conversation with the dead using my board. I casually looked up to him, smiled and asked if he wanted to talk to the dead with me but he understandably declined my request. Actually he was so freaked out and I got such a lecture about doing such terrible ""Demonic things"" that I suppressed my ""Craft"" until much later in life. That was the story of my life, but on the fateful day of 1989 I went to Enchanted Park. That literally changed my life and to this date I still don't know why I am alive? I have survivors guilt I suppose but I'm glad it happened and still wonder if this was some type of test for me?

 The year was 1989, I was in my 8 year of suppressing witchcraft and pretended to be a full Christian that happened to also love the outdoors. I was working a lot of hours and needed some time away from the city to get back to the thing I loved most: Nature and all her beauty is what gave me peace and was the place I needed to be so I decided to go to Pedernales Falls State Park, which was my favorite place to be in other than Canyon lake. One of the themes to my outdoor adventures is that I usually only go when there is a threat of heavy rain so that I can have the park to myself since most people do not like to walk in the rain.

 I was really looking forward to that day, and by the time I reached the park the Ranger reluctantly informed me they had to close the park down because of the threat of flash flooding. I understood that area is prone to flash flooding so I had to rethink my options and found to my surprise that Enchanted Rock Natural area was not terribly far from Pedernales Falls so I took a chance hoping it would be open.

 I was very lucky when I drove to the park it was only lightly raining on ranch road 965 but 3 miles from the park I hit a wall with my car. A thick wall of fog and I had to drive extremely slow since the sharp curves and steep hills made driving treacherous. It was near 10am but the fog was so thick it seemed like it was twilight which made me feel uneasy!

 Well about a mile from the park the fog lifted and it was fairly clear and I was just so inspired by the magical hill I grew to love! Enchanted Rock stands out from all the other hills of the area because it looks like a bald mountain with trees only around it's base. I checked in with the ranger and luckily he said that the park was open but to be very careful because the trails were wet and slippery from the light drizzle and fog that was coming in. I thanked him and drove my car to the final outpost of civilization which happened to be the parking lot to the trail head. 

 As I was heading to the mountain I kept seeing all kinds of warning signs that technical climbers needed to sign a waiver before proceeding. I suppose those warnings should have been a foreshadow of things to come but I wasn't planning on climbing around any of the technical areas I just wanted the safest way to the top so I could lose myself in nature for a bit.

 Oh I just loved being on that massive billion year old rock, it really was a humbling feeling that my presence here would only be a blink of existence in the chapter of this rock's history as I continued climbing on the safe section of the hill.

 As I was halfway up the hill I noticed that the fog I drove through was starting to arrive in the area and the few park buildings below were fading into and out of view as I continued my ascent on this incredible hill. It was strange, as the buildings faded out of view time began to get distorted for me and it seemed like I was going back in time with every step I took. It almost felt like I was somehow transported back to the middle 1800's with all traces of the buildings erased from the fog and then I saw something that startled me!

 In the distance I noticed that Native Americans Elders were dancing in a circle and they seemed happy but they did not notice me. It was a strong vision and one I haven't had in such a long time since I suppressed my Craft and I was just trying to make sense of it all as I waited for the vision to pass so I could continue my climb.

 Before I made it to the top of the hill I did slip on the wet rocks but nothing serious just an embarrassing fall that I was glad no one saw. Actually I was very lucky because I seemed to be the only one one the mountain, there were a few guests staying in their RV's below the mountain but I suppose the drizzle and fog kept them from exploring that day so I happily had the whole mountain to myself! 

 I don't know? Perhaps the vision of the Indians should have concerned me, but hey I'm a Christian (well witch) so these things didn't bother me, but I would like to mention whenever I try to become involved with Indian ways (since I have 27% Native American DNA) I always ended up in extremely dangerous situations almost as if I were cursed? I never understood why because I love and I'm proud of my Native American Heritage, it just seems that bad things happen when I try to get in touch with my Indian heritage and I felt like danger was approaching me!

 As I finally made it to the top of the mountain it felt like I went back to prehistoric times and imagined I was a fat contented lizard sunbathing on the top of this wonderful rock I was calling home. It really felt good to be on the mountain and I felt like I belonged there but for some reason it kept feeling like I was transporting through time from the early prehistoric period to the 1800's. I climbed around a high area of the rock when I saw a vision of a settler pointing his rifle at me and it startled me, but the vision quickly faded and I kept wondering what strange forces were around me to cause me to have such strange visions?

 I know this is kind of silly, but one of the things I loved to do back when I was young was collect 10 ounces of water all over the world I travel to and I even had water I collected from the top of Pikes Peak in Colorado Springs. I suppose all of the rain and drizzle around Enchanted Rock I was lucky to find ample pools of water from the craters around the rock so I collected 10 ounces of that precious water and traded it with 10 ounces of my precious drinking water because I felt that it was only fair to give an even trade with the mountain I grew to love.

 Well after my little trade with the mountain it was around 1pm and the fog just rolled in from the East and consumed the mountain I was on. The fog became so thick that I couldn't see my hand in front of me it was that bad and any trace of daylight was lost and it was very eerie feeling, even for a suppressed witch!

 Well I want you to know that I'm fairly good at navigation and even traveled in the dark primitive areas of Pedernales Falls with no trouble, but this fog was so bad I quickly lost my bearings. I just wonder? Was the water I was taking from the mountain somehow related to the trouble I was getting in? I attempted to get water 3 times from this area on other visits and out of the 100's of water samples I collected from other areas of the world, the only ones that broke were from this mountain!

 I was terribly lost as I was trying to find my way back to the safe descent of the hill but the more I walked the steeper the trail got. The trail was getting so steep that I had to use all four points of my body to keep from falling and the slippery rocks weren't helping! It was getting so bad that I had to move one foot, then the other, my hand and then the other just to move a foot it was that terrible!

 I knew I was in danger but I think the scariest part was wondering how high I was and would I fall a couple of feet or hundreds of feet if I lost my grip? I didn't have a clue. 

 It didn't take long for my question to be answered because it seemed more supernatural things were happening to me! Just out of 

Nowhere the fog completely cleared away and I was able to see my fate. I was right on the edge of an extremely steep cliff and if I lost my grip I was going to fall about a hundred feet below! It seemed like I was 20 feet from the top of the hill and I wondered how in the world I didn't fall from such a steep angle? There was absolutely no way I could have made it to this edge without falling and wondered how I ever made it here?

 In all my life I never really panicked, but every time I tried to move I kept slipping closer to the edge of my doom! I got mad but not scared when I was in the middle of canyon lake in 34 degree weather when I was rowing my inflatable boat and was trapped for hours trying to fight the head wind to cross back to the other side. I even had a similar experience in Guam when I was admiring an incredible beautiful water fall when I slipped and slid near the edge of a 150 foot crevice, but I made it out relatively quick. But here I was trying to keep from falling while facing unknown supernatural things as well. It really frightened me and my body began shaking all over which wasn't helping me to keep from falling!

 Well only a few feet away I noticed there seemed to be an opening to a cave and I slowly crawled to it. I could tell it went straight down but to what I wasn't sure. I did have experience in climbing down caves before and I could see there was light about 20 feet down. I just hoped and prayed it would continue on down to safety so I decided to take a chance to see if I could make it down safely.

 I was carrying a small backpack with me but because of the caves confined space I decided it would be better to drop my pack down to the bottom before I attempted to climb down myself. Before I dropped my pack I carefully wrapped the water I collected so it wouldn't break. Well when my backpack hit the bottom of the cave I heard the glass shatter viciously, it was the victim of a 20 foot fall, I just hope I wouldn't be the next victim and carefully climbed down the crevice.

 I made it to the bottom of the cave and carefully looked to the opening where the light was coming from, but I was still too high and there was no way I could safely get down! Well I was safe in the cave and wondered how long it would take for someone to realize I was missing because there was no way I was going to make it back up from where I climbed down! I didn't think like this for long though, mainly because of my stubborn pride and foolishness! I got myself into this situation and I wasn't going to put anyone else's lives in danger to rescue me so if I fall to my death that is the way it had to be.

 I guess this is where I kind of lost it, nearly two hours had passed in this extremely dangerous situation I was in and it seemed like pure instincts kicked in. I didn't feel human anymore, just this determined primal animal that was going to climb out of this cave and that is exactly what I did!

 I got back to the edge of the extremely dangerous cliff and tried to slowly make my way back to the top of the mountain. It was strange, I had to climb up to get to safety so that I could get to the other side where the slopes were gentle. So I moved my backpack, then my foot, then the other foot, my hand, then the other one and made the forward progress of 1 foot! I was trying my best not to fall and made it 5 feet away from the edge, but then I slipped and slid right back to the edge where I would have fallen over 100 feet if I did not stop in time!

 I was depressed, but I didn't give up so I had to start all over again and slowly made my way this time around 10 feet from the edge. It wasn't as steep in the area I was in and I was actually able to walk normally but I still had to find some way to climb 20 feet to the top of the hill which was very steep! Still to this day I don't know how I kept from falling from this area. It was almost as if the fog transported me to the most dangerous area of the mountain where I had to find my way back and then it came!

 It was the most scary thing I have ever seen in my life, it looked like a dark Angel that was flying above me. I couldn't see it's face but it seemed like death, like there was a skeleton in the black robe it was wearing. It looked at me for a few seconds and then it flew away as fast as it arrived and I never saw it again thankfully! I don't know what that thing was, I've seen non human spirits before but nothing like this. It almost reminded me of the Grim Reaper or Hades? The only problem is that I always believed these things were just legends and never existed, but now I'm not so sure.

 Well other than the vision of the Indians, the settler pointing his rifle at me and the Dark Angel that crept up on me I had one final problem to face. I had to find some way to jump 20 feet straight up to safety because there was no way to climb up on the edge I was facing and if I didn't make it I would fall to my death. Up to this point my backpack kept me alive because it made me slow down to keep from running at the wrong time, but is this the right time now? I had a few feet I could run and prayed the momentum could help me run up the steep hill I was facing!

 I decided to go for it so with all my might I ran as if my life depended on it and ran to the wall with all the force I could carry! I only made it 10 feet up the wall though and was 10 feet short and knew my life was over!

 Instead of falling to my death though something so incredible happened and it was the most bizarre and supernatural thing I ever experienced in my entire life. It felt as if something was pushing me up the wall and I felt like I flew the last 10 feet I needed to safety! It was the most impossible thing I ever experienced and I understand people won't believe me, but it happened, it somehow miraculously happened and I made it to the top alive and well!

 Oh it was such a relief to be at the top of the mountain where I could finally go to the other side to safety. It was dark by the time I made it to the top but the fog mysteriously cleared and I was able to get my bearings to go to the easy safe trail to the bottom.

 I was so relieved and happy I don't remember what I was singing but it was gently happy songs as I made my way down the mountain. Although I was happy I became extremely sore, I guess my muscles knew it was safe to complain to me from the tremendous pressure and agony I put them through!

 Since I was so sore from my ordeal I went to the showers the camp brochure proudly proclaimed was warm and inviting, but when I got to the showers only cold water came out. Oh well so much for a warm shower to soothe my aching muscles haha, I was just glad to be alive and decided to go straight home to get into a warm bath for comfort.

 Well as I was leaving the shower area a father and his son had such bewildered looks on their faces when they saw me and they abruptly left. I just smiled and began to exit the building as well but before I did I saw movement in the mirror that caught my eye. I carefully went to the mirror and was amazed at what I saw! It was me but I looked like a wild animal with thousands of tiny droplets of water on my hair I suppose from the drizzle and fog I encountered that day. I also had a peaceful look on my face so I just smiled, walked out the building and went to my car to drive home.

 The next day I found out to my horror that a young 18 year old boy fell off a mountain 60 or so miles from my location by Garner State park on a hill/cliff area that was called Mount Baldy! He died from his injuries and I couldn't help but wonder if that dark angel that came to me at Enchanted Rock was supposed to take my life or his? I was 24 years old at the time and I wonder how similar did I look to the poor young man who died that day! Did the dark angel make a mistake? I don't know, but I lived and the poor kid didn't, I guess that is where the survivors guilt came in!

 The last thing I want to say about Enchanted rock is that I went back to it around 6 more times, I thankfully didn't have any more supernatural experiences happen to me but I did try to get more 2 more samples of water from the area on different occasions and on each occasion both glass containers broke within 24 hours of collecting water from the park. I vowed to never try taking water from the area ever again and still wonder how in the world I was able to fly on that fateful first day I visited the park?"
"The Bathroom & The Yellow Girl","Minnesota","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I was about 7 or 8 years old. I was in the girl's bathroom in my elementary school. It was as big as a normal size living room. It had two bathroom stalls, two sinks, and one paper towel dispenser. I was in the smaller bathroom stall, while my friend, let's call her Micky, was in the bigger stall. We both climbed up the toilets and we both were looking around and just having regular fun. What kids do is what I call it.

 As we were doing kid things in the bathroom stalls, I hear the door open. Now, the door, you can't see it from the stalls, there is a wall, kind of like a mini hallway, then you get to the bathroom. So you can't see the door unless if you are standing right in front of it. So, I hear the door open and close. I thought someone was coming in, but I really couldn't care less when I was that age. As soon as the door closed, I hear footsteps, but it was a tapping sound, as if someone was wearing high heels. As the tip tap sound started to come closer and closer, my friend Micky was already off the toilet and trying to do something with the toilet paper, I don't really remember what she was doing, but it didn't seem to me that she noticed the footsteps.

 I turned my head and saw a woman right next to the stall I was in. Behind her were the sinks so, you wouldn't really be waiting where she was. The odd thing was, she was as tall as the stalls. She was just standing there and staring straight off to nothingness. I could not see her face, she was wearing a large sun hat, it was yellow, while she was wearing a knee high sundress, which was also yellow. Her heels were yellow too, in a quick second I thought how much she must have liked yellow. She also had very long black hair. She also had very pale skin that seem whiter than snow.

 Micky made a laughing scream and I turned my head, Micky was just laughing because she was pulling all the toilet paper out. Then I suddenly turned my head back to the woman because I heard a small voice. I have no idea what it said, but I know I heard something that sounded like a voice from a girl. As soon as I turned my head she was gone. I was the only one who saw her, I was the only one who noticed her, I was the only one who heard her.

 That wasn't the last thing I have ever gotten in that school. I have seen lots of different supernatural things in my elementary school. So that is just one of my very many paranormal happenings that I've seen or gotten. I hope you enjoyed and tell me what you thought and give me some of your ideas of what it could have been."
"Confirmation I See Dead People","Washington","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","First off, I'm so happy I found this site! 

This happened over 5 years ago when I worked at a Headshop in Tacoma. I worked there for several years and our regulars we became really close to. Tyler (fake name) used to come in once or twice a week. I noticed for the last two weeks he hasn't been in, didn't really think much of it. 

The next day he came in for his usual. I asked him where he's been and he told me AZ for his Grandmother's funeral. At that moment in time I see a women standing behind him in full color, just like I see normal people day to day. When I saw that women I thought, ""Oh I just made her up in my head. That's what I think his grandma looks like."" I cashed him out and then he left. I told my coworker what I thought I just saw... His Grandma. She told me to tell him. I told her no. What if I'm wrong, then I'll look stupid. Plus, if it's real then I'm going to be that ""crazy"" lady. 

A couple weeks have went by and he came back in for his usual. At that moment I was in the bathroom and came out from the back and he was there. My friend Ashley (fake name) word vomits ""Erica has something to tell you!"" So, I courage up and told him what I saw. 

I told him ""I think I saw your Grandma standing behind you the other day"" He looks puzzled. I said ""she had blonde"" and he finishes ""curly hair?"" I confirmed yes. I told him ""she was wearing a red shirt"" He goes ""her favorite color was red"" I also told him she had a ""gold chain cross necklace"" He pulls out his phone and shows me a picture and he says ""like this?""

IT WAS HER! IT WAS THE LADY I SAW STANDING BEHIND HIM! SHE WAS STILL WITH HIM!

Of course I screamed, naturally. He turned white as a ghost. We both kind of stood there not knowing what to say or do. I then confirmed to myself I saw a dead person. CLEAR.AS.DAY! As I called it, he never came back. I must of scared him. Little does he know, it scared me more.

"A Strange Encounter","Texas","Misc","Day 47 Of 366 ""A Strange Encounter""

Thursday Jan 10 2008

 A very strange thing happened to me one night near the witching hour over 20 years ago when I was living at an old house by myself. I wanted to share this strange supernatural story with you to get you ready for the 3 intense encounters I am going to share with you this Saturday night that occurred from my past. LOL, just remember, I keep an open mind when dealing with supernatural worldly events and try to remember exactly what happened during the encounter to see if it can be explained logically or scientifically. Well in this case I have no explanation what happened other than a strange encounter that occurred with no real definitive purpose as to why it happened?

 That fateful night started out normal enough. I fell asleep just like every other normal night and was sleeping soundly. Just after 12am though, a noise began to come from the floor, and it woke me up. I lived in an old house and it was in good condition, other than there being a roach problem, so I thought the sound I was hearing was coming from a roach walking on the newspaper I left on the floor of my room. The room was very dark, but I knew where the light switch was, so I flung out of bed, and turned on the light as fast as I could, hoping to catch the roach by surprise. As soon as I turned on the light though, I was disappointed to see that the little critter must have been faster than what I was. Strange though, I still heard the rustling sounds the newspaper was making so I took a closer look at what was before me and was shocked at what I saw!

 My telephone was on top of the newspaper and it was moving by itself very slowly across the room. The carpet floor was level so gravity could not be moving it, yet it moved on it's own about 10 feet, and amazingly enough, slammed against the wall at the end of that 10 foot travel. Well needless to say I had trouble sleeping the rest of the night (note this is before I embraced witchcraft fully) and I couldn't figure out any explanation as to why this was happening at the moment? I was in perfect health, not taking any medications, and also don't drink so there is no issue about this being an intoxication hallucination!

 I feel so bad because if this were to happen now, the first thing I would do is reach for the phone and see if anyone, or anything is on the line. Ha, ha, I feel at home when it comes to supernatural occurrences, so now whenever something out of the ordinary happens, I absolutely love it, and hope I can make a difference to the entity trying to get my attention. As a witch I understand that strange things can happen from time to time in my life, and it is important to keep my composure, so that I can find out why things happen the way they do. Being a witch is about self discovery and knowing yourself from the inside/out. Regardless of how strange or frightful a situation presents itself to you, it is always important to never lose sight of who you are: A strong individual that is willing to face the unknown and triumph over it. The worst thing a witch can do is have fear in their heart, self doubt, or lose control of the situation that is before them. Objects that move by themselves, voices, spirits, telekinesis, astral projections, possessions, paranormal activity are all things that may suddenly face you out of the blue and cause a crisis if you let it. Having a great sense of humor and keeping control of your emotions is the best way to keep unexpected things from getting out of control. So keep that in mind if something goes bump in the night at your house, and find out what it is if you dare! If not, call me I'll gladly check it out for ya, lol!

 So what would I do if a phone started moving or flying in my room? I would try to catch it and see if someone needed to talk to me on the line. If no one was there, I would quickly circle cast, placing a circle of protection around me and call upon the entity why they are in my presence? If I do not get a response from them, I would bless the house and keep it pure with loving thoughts of peace and happiness and sleep very soundly knowing I was protected and faced the unknown encounter with love:). Boo! Lol take care, sleep well, and have fun in this incredible world we live in, I promise to do the same!"
"My Mamaws Goodbye","North Carolina","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","This is not an experience that I personally witnessed, but one that my husband had, and shared with me. 

On June 24th 2017, I received one of the worst knocks at my door, that I'll never be able to forget.

It was one of my uncles coming over to inform us that my Mamaw had just passed away that late evening. We suspect it was from a heartattack, that she must of had while taking her nightly bath. 

It was a very hard time for me and my family during this time, as my Mamaw meant the world to all of us, and she was the glue to our family. I grew up living beside her, and considered her as a second mother to me.

 I'd like to add that my Mamaw was full Japanese, and was from Okinawa Japan, which is where she lived when she had met my Papaw, back when he served in the Army, in Vietnam. 

Unfortunately I don't really know much about my Mamaw's life when she lived there, as she apparently was a very secretive woman. So as far as knowing her religion and beliefs then, I'm at a lost. I do know that as she lived here in America, she considered herself to be a Christian woman.

Now onto the experience. 

It had now been 2 days after my Mamaw had passed away, with it now being June 26th 2017. 

I had yet again cried myself to sleep that night, at the foot of the bed, and my husband and 2 year old daughter were sleeping at the head of the bed. My husband said he was restless this night for some reason, and as he looked over at me, he noticed someone standing right above my head, looking down at me.

He started to feel uncomfortable, as he didn't know who he was looking at, and why they were in our room.

As he laid there in bed, with our daughter sleeping in his arms, he watched as this young woman he realized, reached her arm out to touch my head, and bent down to give me a kiss.

Shocked over what he's seeing at this time, he watches as this young woman looks over to him, and then starts to walk over to the side of the bed, where she reaches out to touch our daughter (my husband said at this point, he was holding onto our daughter tightly, not sure of what was happening), and bends over to give her a kiss on the head as well. 

My husband feeling nervous by this point, over what he's seeing, said that after this woman kissed our daughter, she stood there and looked over at him, when all of a sudden he said he felt flooded with emotions, to the point of being in tears. 

He said that he felt very emotional at this time, and didn't understand why he was feeling that way, as the woman then started to walk out of our room, and disappear past our door.

The next morning my husband was telling me about what he saw the night before, and described what the young woman looked like. I quickly searched on my phone to find an old picture I had of my Mamaw, when she was in her 20's, and showed it to him. He was so shocked to see that she was without a doubt, who he had saw last night. 

After he told me what all he saw, I knew that it had to be my Mamaw coming to say goodbye to me and my kids one last time. I was very close to her, to where she always worried about me like a mother does her child. So I knew that it made sense that she would come see me one last time, to make sure that I'm ok.

As for the way my husband felt when she had looked over to him, I told him that I believe that it would have been her way of telling him to take care of me and our kids.

I went back over to visit with my Papaw afterwards, and noticed when I was walking through the yard, that there was a candle lit in the window of the living room. I asked one of my aunts about its purpose, and was speechless over what she told me.

Like I said, our family doesn't know what religion or faith my Mamaw had before moving to America, but apparently in some religion for Japanese people (I'm not 100% on the details of this religion, so please correct me if I'm wrong in any of it, as I'm very interested in knowing more about it) they do some kind of memorial type thing, for like 30 days, or maybe longer, where they place a candle in the window of the family's home, to be a light/beacon for the lost loved one, to find their way back home (again, I'm unsure of the details, so anyone that knows more on this, I hope you can let me know more on it). But during this time frame, I want to say that it's said to be when the dead is able to say their goodbyes to the family, and something about family not being able to travel anywhere during this time frame, as it is bad luck? There's more to their beliefs on this, but with me not being sure on the details, I rather not write more on what I'm not 100% sure of. 

Granted we weren't sure what beliefs Mamaw had before moving to America, my aunt (her daughter) learned about this from one of our Japanese relatives (we don't really have that much contact with that side unfortunately), and said that though my Mamaw considered herself to be of Christian faith, choose to partake in this type of memorial when my brother past away, so my aunt wanted to light the same candle for her mother, that she lit for my brother.

 My whole point on bringing this up this belief, was because I was told that this candle was put in the window last night, the same night my husband saw my Mamaw. It so happens that we live right next door to my grandparents, so in my head, hearing about this candle, made me think that somehow it helped guide my Mamaw to me that night. I'm sure I'm probably overthinking it, as I know others have lost loved ones who visit them without having a candle, but I just thought the timing of it was interesting. 

 Something that I did start to notice after my Mamaw passed, was how our bedroom lights would constantly flicker, to the point of cutting off and on a lot. It would do this on off throughout the day, at different times. We could never find a reason for it, and found it strange that it didn't happen until after my Mamaw had passed away. So I wondered if it was her checking in. But after a few months of this going on, it eventually stopped happening. We didn't change the light bulb, or do anything that should have changed anything, so it made me even more curious if it really was my Mamaw. Though I do not believe she's a ghost in anyway, just only popping in to check up on me. 

I hope I didn't go too off topic with this submission, and hope that I wasn't way off on telling what I heard about the memorial (not sure what it's called exactly) some Japanese people do for their loved ones.

My Mamaw was truly a very amazing woman, who I'm blessed to have had help raise me. I hope y'all enjoy reading about this amazing experience, I only wish I was able to have witnessed.

Merry Christmas to everyone!"
"Friendly Nudge During Late Night Feeding","New Jersey","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","This is one of the more helpful experiences I've had with our friends on the other side. 

My son was born in September of 2011. At the time we were living on the 2nd floor of a two family home in an industrial area of Hillside, NJ. 

I never for a second expected to leave all of the childcare responsibilities to my wife, especially since she was working the overnight shift for her job. Anytime our son cried during the night I always got up for him to let my wife rest. He would cry for his bottle every 90 minutes at one point so there were a lot of sleepless nights. 

The second floor had a bit of an open concept. There was a small dining area directly behind the couch, and the kitchen was to the left of the dining area. It had a little breakfast bar in between. 

This particular night I sat down on our 3 person couch that was directly in front of the dining table. It was really late at night, around 2am. I sat down on the couch and gave my son his bottle. And, as any parent can understand, I started falling asleep while giving my son his bottle. No sooner did I start falling asleep I felt someone poke right under my shoulder blade. 

The poke was right behind me - even though my back was completely against the couch, and my wife was asleep in our bedroom at the time. But in my sleep deprived state I was just thankful for the help. So I looked back over my shoulder and said ""Thanks"" to whoever it was that kept me awake during feeding time. 

I did tell my wife about it the next day, and she shared the same sentiment. We appreciated any help we got during those days:)"
"Random Happenings","California","Psychic / Medium","I have a few experiences that happened to me that I would like to share here and see what you guys think. 

I lived in Seattle for a few years when I was a teenager, my dad moved us to Seattle after his brother died in a car accident. My uncle left behind his widow, 6 kids and his business that consisted of a tavern. His widow needed help running the business so my dad agreed to go manage it for her. The tavern was a family run business, my father managed it, and other family members worked as bartenders, waiters, cleaning crew, etc. The tavern was open until 1:30 am 7 days a week, my dad was there almost every night. 

The tavern was very popular in the Latino community, on the weekends it had live music so there was a cover charge to get in. One particular weekend, my dad decided to come home early, he was exhausted so he called it a night and came home around 11:00pm. 

 Around 1:00am I woke up for no apparent reason, maybe two minutes later the phone started ringing, this was a time before cell phones so one of the two phones was always in my room. I remember sitting up and reaching for the phone that was on my nightstand when I told myself ""I don't want to be the one told that Ricky is dead"". Ricky was my 23 year old cousin that worked as security in the tavern.

 The phone rang for a while, my parents never used to pick up the phone because 9 out of 10 times it was for me. My dad finally got tired of hearing it ring so he went to the living room to answer. A few seconds later I heard my dad yelling on the phone, he seemed very angry at someone, I obviously couldn't hear the person on the other side but I was thinking ""dad is angry because they killed Ricky and he wasn't there to help him"". I knew he had been shot in the back by a drunk customer, I knew he was dead.

 Ricky had been called to the door because there was a customer that was upset he wasn't allowed in. Ricky explained to him that he had already had too much to drink and to come back another day. The guy left and about an hour later returned with a gun and shot my cousin 4 times in the back. I never told anyone that I knew Ricky was dead before my dad even picked up the phone. It is a very sensitive subject in my family and I wouldn't bring it up now. I remember my aunt, Ricky's mom, was told that he died instantly, somehow I know that is not true. I have a feeling that he knew what was happening and was really scared. I've kept this to myself for many years and I've always wondered how and why I knew this. 

When my mother lived in her house in Mexico she was good friends with one of her neighbors. The neighbor was a single mom of twin daughters and one son. The kids were really nice kids, always ran errands for my mom and constantly checked up on her.

 I remember that over the years when I would visit my mother (almost every weekend) I would sometimes see them running around the neighborhood, they would always greet us with a smile and a wave.

 One weekend before heading to my mom's house I stopped at a local casino and was playing the slots when I looked up and I saw the neighbor's son looking at me. So, I smiled at him and instead of smiling back he quickly looked away. I thought it was weird because he was always so friendly, then I thought that maybe he wasn't supposed to be there. The legal gambling age in Mexico is 18 years old, he looked like he wasn't a day older.

 After a few minutes I look up again and this time he's sitting by a slot machine, I remember he was sitting sideways and spinning his chair a little. I noticed he didn't seem to be playing, I thought maybe he was waiting on someone, he seemed to be looking out into the rows of machines. I forgot about him for a while and when I remembered him I looked up and he was gone. I just thought it was weird he didn't greet me even though it seemed like he recognized me. 

 That night after a little bit of gambling I headed over to my mom's house to spend the rest of the weekend. After talking to my mom for a while that night, she told me that she had gone to a funeral two days before. The neighbor's son had been killed. He was having lunch with friends and two gunmen went in the restaurant and started shooting. The neighbor's son got shot in the head and died instantly. I told my mom that it was impossible, I had seen him just a few hours ago. It was not someone that looked like him, it was him!

 I was planning on telling my mom I saw him that night but she beat me to it and told me he had died the week before. I don't know why I saw him, we weren't close, he also didn't seem to want me to relay any kind of message. He was just there...

About 10 years ago I was having a meeting with my Supervisor and she excused herself to take a personal phone call. She seemed to be arguing with someone and told the person that they would talk later. She apologized for the interruption and explained to me that her mom was giving her drama about feeling sick and had driven herself to the hospital. She said that her mom would often tell her that she was sick but the doctor's always told her it was just to get attention, it always turned out she was fine. During the rest of our meeting I could not get the feeling that her mom was not okay. I told myself to stop because I said to myself ""her mom is going to die"". I had never met her mom but something told me that my Supervisor was going to be sorry she didn't accompany her mom to the hospital that day. After our meeting I went out to lunch and when I got back I was told that my Supervisor had a family emergency and she had to leave and they didn't think she was coming back. That's when I knew for sure, I mean I was 100% positive that her mom had passed away.

 As you have already guessed, her mom died that day in the hospital. It was very shocking to her family because the lady was only 60 years old and was told she was healthy. All the times she made drama over being sick it was for unrelated symptoms, headache, stomachache, back pain etc. My supervisor took her mom's death especially hard because she felt guilty for not believing she was sick and letting her drive herself to the hospital. I knew her mom was not mad at her and didn't want her to feel guilty, her mom felt bad that she fought with her the last time they spoke. Of course I never told her this because I have no way of knowing, I just do. 

Please don't think I'm crazy or I'm making this up. I know it's really out there, that is why I've never told anyone about this. I'm hoping there are people that have had something like this happen to them?"
"Interesting Visiting Nurse","Massachusetts","Haunted Places","While in the Hospital, after a serious surgery, I had some strange encounters. What I am writing about today, had an impact on me.

I was given a private room at my request. I have had other events in the past, and you do not want to disturb the other person right next to you, when you see something they do not, I have learned.

The Hospital is the largest in Western/central MA area, they have taken over or closed most smaller Hospitals in this area. While it is a bit of a trip, the value of good medicine makes it worth it. It seems to be under construction most of the time, for improvements.

My visit was a long one, but I was healing slowly. Sitting there just watching the people pass, was one form of entertainment. They usually kept my big door to the hall open. The Doctors, nurses, hospital workers and visitors walked the hallway. I began to see a woman that didn't fit in. She had a white outfit, white stockings, and had a cap tucked into her short hair, she would glance at me and smile. I know the CTN (Certified Technical Nurse) wore an outfit of maroon. The Registered Nurses wore dark blue. Doctors would pass by but they wore white coats, over normal clothes.

The floor plan was a large oval with rooms on one side and a large nursing station and supplies in the middle. All had been redone a few years ago. For exercise the nurse assigned to me, would walk me around the oval. On one of these walks we met the odd nurse head on. She and my nurse blended in a very fast blur, then separated, walking on. My nurse was speaking at that moment, and showed no indication of what had just happened, and I closed my mouth quickly. As the odd nurse was walking much faster then we were, we met her again, and smiling she stepped in front and the nurses collided again. She had a full smile on and was looking at me, as they blended (again). Like look at me, I am a little brat! She was in need of entertainment, if her curse was to walk that circle for ever.

A night or two later there was a mix of raised voices coming from the nursing station. They were arguing about supplies not where they belong or missing. There is ALWAYS one or more RNs sitting at the station. Just then the white nurse puts her head around the door of my room, and she is silently laughing uncontrollably. I realized she seldom had an audience and was making the most of it. She had a hand it the missing supplies. Perhaps if only to make me laugh.

It worked and I did laugh! Poor thing, I wonder how long she will be stuck in that walkway. What could she have done to be rewarded that kind of punishment."
"Unnatural Cat Cries","Utah","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","In Midvale UT., I rented a small, isolated old house. What was my garage is now a small apartment. I've heard noises so, I started doing some research on the property. It seems an elderly lady and her son lived here. The son would carry his bedridden mother to the garage while he worked on cars. If she needed anything she would knock on the walls. Eventually, she passed away in the garage and the son moved away. 

In time, I baked some welcome cookies for the new girl who rented the garage/apartment. I brought her the cookies and she welcomed me into her home. We chatted a bit, suddenly, there was loud, hard knocking on the walls. She opened the front door and no one was there, we walked completely around her yard and all gates were locked. We returned to the house and the knocking continued, my neighbor stood up and said, ""get out, they want you!"" She opened her door and pushed me out. Perplexed and frightened, I hurried home and locked my doors. Later that night by phone, I was speaking with my sister,suddenly, I heard a cat crying. It sounded like a poor, juvinial imitation of a cat crying. It was definitely coming from inside my house. Even my sister confirmed she could hear it.

 Two years have passed, I've moved to Taylorsville, UT. I've bought a big house. Last night I was awoken by a poor imitation of a cat crying, loud and clear, downstairs in my livingroom. Hearing that exact sound fills me with fear. I don't know why, I'm scared! Even now as I write, I don't want to sleep, it's almost two a.m...I'm scared!"
"Paranormal Entity? Mulitiverse? Or Both?","Indiana","Haunted Places","I purchased a house over a year ago which was in a dilapidated state when purchased. As such, I spent the first year or so only doing landscaping and general cleaning. Needing to commit more time to the project, the wife and I decided to stay there, it was livable, just not the most luxurious. (The house had been abandoned for several years prior to our purchase/occupancy.) 

One day I told the wife I was going to go into the attic to clean it out because I knew there were books and some odds and ends left behind in the attic. I was hoping something might be of value. The wife literally told me not to bother, jokingly stating that I was going to wake ""Annabel"" or something (referring to the movie). I laughed and went upstairs to search for treasure. There ended up being less than I thought but I did find a box of books. However, looking down at the box, I was sick to my stomach, seeing a Ouija board in the box, and assuming that it had of course been used in the house or on the land. I have had encounters with such negativeness before and through prayer and exercised oil and medals have been able to ward them off, only over lengthy, frustrating periods. 

I informed the wife, who was quite upset and said I shouldn't have gone up there. I went back up with holy water and exercised medals and nailed them into areas of the attic and sprinkled the oil and water everywhere. I then poured water on the board and removed it from the house, using a garbage bag to touch it, not wanting to so much as make physical contact. I then threw it outside where it would remain until I told a friend about the event. The friend was intrigued and asked for the board. I hesitantly agree to transport it to his home where he took it and had a number of paranormal experiences of his own immediately after until he got rid of the board himself (this is another story).

Even getting rid of the board however, things were happening at the house. The door to the outside would open on its own late night and early morning. Things would fall that ""weren't able to fall."" Despite all the odd things, I made all efforts to logically justify and explain them, and found comfort in the explanations.

However, one night I got up in the middle of the night to use the washroom and in walking into the bathroom, my foot grazed something in the threshold to the bathroom. I squatted down in the dark and observed what I thought was a nail, exact dead center of the wooden threshold and a second slightly to its left. Being late and tired and not wanting to do anything about it, I just figured a nail somehow worked its way out, and ""UP"" through the new traffic in the house. I put a roll of toilet paper over it it make sure if the wife got up she wouldn't kick it or step on it and decide to take care of it in the morning. 

In the morning, I had time to think about the event though and swore that my buddy who installed the bathroom tile took all the nails out of the threshold at the time that were at all sticking up or crooked. I helped him myself. I told my father in law about the story, as he and my wife's uncle installed my toilet and sink, said that there were no nails sticking up or present in the threshold, that they had laid on that floor and in that area and they were positive. Talking to the wife we both also agreed that, having started living in the house since August and it now being September, there was no way those nails were there.

I was definitely freaked out by the situation and eventually got motivated to grab a hammer and nail them back into the threshold. I took a swing...nothing. I took a harder swing, it didn't budge. I then realized these weren't nails, but screws, and construction/deck type screws, with a lock pattern on the head which I didn't even have a tool for. These screws had ""unscrewed themselves"" up out of the wood. 

I wasn't sure if an entity tied to the board did this, but if so, how? I removed those screws with my buddy over a year earlier when he installed the tile. I, the wife, father in law and uncle all said they weren't there just a week ago. These screws hadn't existed in that spot for over a year, yet now they were there again and ""unscrewed."" 

I've been reading a lot on multidimensional realities, holographic realities, etc and how we may be phasing in and out of different ones all of the time based on our spiritual evolution. Did I cross into a different one, in which the screws were never taken out? Was I in the same reality with an entity having done this? To try and hurt us? 

I am still confused to this day if it was an entity, something to do with the holographic nature of reality or both."
"Concerning Hallucinations And Otherwordly Matters","Florida","Misc","As a skeptical agnostic, I often question my experiences or outright dismiss them assuming I am overreacting to stimuli. However, some minor experiences and memories have led me to some questions concerning some feedback by the YGS community. After my last dismissal of strange events, some members noted that I should compare stimulus and decide if it's meaningless or not, such as comparing a shoulder squeeze to a muscle twitch.

I have had bouts of auditory hallucinations throughout my life that I actually forgot about until I had one upon falling asleep from physical exhaustion. It triggered memories of ones I've had in the past. Every auditory hallucination I have ever heard has sounded like an actual person inside my head or if you were to turn up the volume on the TV and trap that noise and play it in your head. So I know what it sounds like when you hear something like that. About a couple of weeks ago, I felt a presence behind me in the bathroom but I ignored it and just assumed it to be my imagination. But then I heard an extremely faint voice say something indiscernible near me. Of course this is not the first time I've heard them. 

I do not know if there are types of auditory hallucinations that can sound like actual people speaking next to you, but it seems to me that when generally described, you hear it in your head. These whispers and voices that I've heard sound nothing like the stress-induced auditory hallucinations I've had upon falling asleep. I still do not know what to make of my generally mundane experiences, but this has piqued my interest that I'm not so mad or that my body is completely screwy. I have also noticed whenever I heard something talking it doesn't sound like a person. It always sounds disembodied, fluid, and whispery. Or it sounds like it's wrapped in static or electricity. I don't know what to make of these experiences.

In my last submission, I thought some of the sounds and touches I've been feeling were easily explained away. I still think that is the explanation for some of those. And up until now I was completely convinced the staticy voices are just my imagination. But now I'm not so sure. So I wanted to know what the YGS community had to say about this. Am I reading into this? Can auditory hallucinations present in various ways? Because if so, I stand by my original conclusion like a stubborn mule. 🤔"
"Patio Door Face And The Shadow Figure","California","Haunted Places","I remember when I was a senior in high school, I was preparing for college. When I wasn't doing that, I would be spending time with my family. 

We were just playing the Wii and chatting about life when my mom sent me to get her purse and when I asked her where was it, she told me it was in the Dining Room/Kitchen. The Dining Room shared the same room as the Kitchen so hence the fusion. 

Now at this time, lights were out and as I walked down the hallway, I figured I didn't need to switch on the lights because it would only be a quick and easy task. While it was a quick and easy task, this experience was terrifying. As I looked around for her bag, I found it on a chair near the hallway, but as I looked over to the patio door (which the blinds were closed), I saw a woman's face. A WOMAN'S FACE SMILING AT ME. Just the face. No body. Besides the fact she had medium length hair, there were no other features than the face and the hair. (Yes, as in features, eyes, nose, lips.) 

I didn't stick around to catch any more details, I ran, I ran straight to my family, just telling them what had happened. This story is also one of the reasons I shut my bedroom doors and flick on lights wherever I go. Of course, I flick them off as I return. 

Now as for the shadow figure, I remember my mom had an idea of sleeping in the dining room area. The area was big, so we set up blankets pillows, and warm heat pads. We watched Korean dramas and other movies with my brother. Afterwards, my mom told us it was time to go to bed. 

As I'm lying there, I start to draw late at night. Yeah, I'm a night owl, and it has been a bad habit since high school. I looked to the kitchen and as I looked towards the counter, I saw a tall shadow figure swish past quick from right to left. It was quick enough to see what it was. No, we didn't have anything hanging in the kitchen nor did have anything hanging in the dining room. I was puzzled.

 The next night, we we sleeping in the dining room again. Again, I stay up to draw. But then I hear thuds. Like multiple thuds. Like the sound of a person running. It varied from walking to running. I was even more perplexed. 

For those of you curious, no, I haven't seen the ""patio lady"" and no, I haven't heard those footsteps ever since then."
"The Voices That I Thought Was Thiers","California","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I remember when I was in my first year of college, I woke up around 3 AM in the morning. 

Let me give you an idea of the placement of the master bedroom to my room. My room was just perpendicular to the Master bedroom and parallel to the bathroom. But the main focus was the master bedroom and my room. 

Notably, I was groggy and apparently feeling restless because I wasn't able to go back to sleep. As I was trying to fall asleep, I noticed my mom and my brother were not in my room. The reason this concerned me was that I had extra beds in my room and that night my mom and my brother slept in my room with me. Of course, waking up at 3 in the morning only to find me in a dimly lit room by myself was terrifying. At least at that moment. 

I tried to fall asleep again but to no use. I had a sudden urge to find my mom and my brother. As I got out of my room, I heard what I thought was my mom's and my brother's voice coming from the master bedroom. I couldn't make out what they were saying, it was clear enough to know they were saying something, but not clear enough to decipher what they were saying.

But as soon as I turned to the master bedroom, it was pitch dark in there. A sense of dread hit me as I looked around in a panic for them. I was scared out of my mind until I found them sleeping in my brother's room. Needless to say, I slept in the hammock next to my brother's bed just to feel safe. I have no idea how I was able to fall asleep at that time, but needless to say, that wasn't the only time I heard voices."
"Black Hooded Figure With Expressionless White Face","Louisiana","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I have a few experiences with the being I mentioned in the title starting in 2012. I have pretty much kept this on the down low except for telling my wife and pastor.

 It started as what I thought was night terrors. I'm laying in my bed watching tv and as I turn my head to get my remote I saw a figure in front of my closet. I immediately froze. This figure wore a black hood, but didn't have a white face. It looked like a normal older man, but with an angry/sinister look and a reddish face. I'm only adding this in case of a connection and to give a back story of when things started getting odd for me. 

Well after maybe ten seconds or so I regained control of my body and the being disappeared. Fast forward about a year later I'm staying at my aunt's house at this time. I look outside and see this figure wearing a black hood and an expressionless white face facing my direction. It almost looked like it had to be a mask instead of a face. I would put it off as just my mind playing tricks on me until I seen it a few times at my aunt's and at my work over the course of about a year and a half. 

Had an experience with my aunt's pomeranian where he seemed to have been dragged into a room and the door slammed shut. He was cowering under the bed, which is abnormal for this dog. It was just me and my cousin in the house and she was in the room opposite the house when this occurred. Not sure if its relevant, but happened during the timespan.

Finally, one day I was leaving for work in the afternoon. As I'm about to walk out of the living room I see this being come from the ground right beside me. Then I smelled wet dog. We had no dog at this time so it wasn't the pomeranian. This scent was extremely strong. I then heard a growl coming from behind me and I can swear I felt something else in the room with me and this being. The being appeared to be pulled back into the ground relatively fast and then the smell went away. This incident was in 2014. 

For some reason it is currently on my mind and won't leave my head. I googled what I put as the title of this and found people with similar experiences on this site so I decided to share. I don't know what to make of it. I have had no paranormal incidents since then."
"Angel Of The Dark","Kentucky","Haunted Places","I live on the outskirts of the small historic town of Vine Grove. It's a residential area well off the beaten path surrounded by forest and close to Otter Creek. 

 I've lived here for 9 years with my chocolate Lab/Bullmastiff mix named Harley. He had to be put down last year because he was deaf, almost blind, and was starting to get down in his hips. He was my best friend and it broke my heart to lose him.

 I haven't had any experiences with the paranormal since I was a little kid living on a haunted farm with my mother and 3 siblings but that is another story for another time. 

 On November of 2012, the night it began, I was living alone with just Harley for company. He was sleeping across from me in his doggie bed next to the TV. I was laid back on my couch watching a late movie I'd been wanting to see. It was a little after midnight and I noticed Harley was getting restless. He began to whimper and pace around the room. On his second lap he stopped right by the door staring down the hallway. I didn't think much of it at first because he had already been out to do his business. I went back to my show but after 4 or 5 minutes had passed I noticed he still hadn't moved. I asked him if he saw a mouse or something but he still did not avert from his gaze. I started to feel uneasy, like we weren't alone in the house. I slowly got up and walked over behind Harley. I peered down the hallway to the open door of the bedroom on the very end but it was pitch black. I stood there for a few minutes so my eyes would adjust. Then I heard this low guttural growl coming from Harley, the kind when you know a dog is serious and about to bite. I looked down at him and his hackles were raised. This made my apprehension even worse. I looked back down the hallway and for an instant I thought I saw a dark shadow figure move from the doorway. I thought ""oh shiat! There is someone in the house!"" I went to step past Harley to turn on the hall light but he blocked me and pushed into me and made me step back. He was determined to keep himself between me and whatever he was seeing or sensing.

 Then just like that it was over. Harley whimpered once more and went back and laid down. I tried to get back into my movie but to no avail. I knew if I didn't go and check it out, I'd never rest that evening. So I got back up, pulled my bat out from behind the couch, turned on the hall light, and marched down the hall to the bedroom. I didn't waste any time. I quickly reached my hand in and flipped on the light. Cautiously I stepped in and to my surprise I could find nothing amiss. I checked the window and it was locked. I began to think my eyes had played tricks on me. I started to leave when I began to hear this eerie music from somewhere in the room. I walked to the middle of the room and sure enough, it was coming out of the floor vent. I thought ""what in the hell?""

 I walked to the doorway and could hear talking on the TV. I had nothing else on in the house. I walked back to the vent and it stopped abruptly. Then I heard this scraping coming from the closet, along with a familiar popping noise like donk, donk, donk. It only took me a second before I realized what it was and it instantly sent a shiver down my spine and I immediately broke out in goosebumps.

 My mom had given me this 2 foot angel. It gave me the creeps because it held a candle which was a clear Christmas bulb under its chin so the face was distorted by shadows. Exactly like when a person holds a flashlight under their chin to look scary. When it was plugged in the arm holding the light moved back to it's side and up catching the wings and it made a grinding popping sound like plastic grinding on plastic joints and when the wings moved it made a donk,donk, donk sound. The only thought I had at that moment was ""OMG""!This damn thing is moving in the closet without power"". I began to break out in a sweat. Part of me wanted to walk over and yank the door open but my inner voice said, ""Leave this room now""! So I backed up out of the room and closed the door. I didn't even turn the light out.

 The next day I called my mom and she came to visit. I told her what happened and when I did, she agreed we should get rid of it. I'm not sure but I think it ended up at a Goodwill.

 It was quiet for about a week or so and then I met Nikki. I dated this girl off and on for the next 3 years and quite a bit happened so instead of trying to write it all down in one big story, I'm going to write it down in sections as the incidences occurred. Thanks for your time."
"Goodbye And Proof From Dad","New Mexico","Family / Friends Visits","My dad passed away suddenly and unexpectedly about a year and a half ago. I've hesitated to post the series of experiences that I had afterward but after reading many inspiring personal experiences on this site, I've decided to go ahead. Maybe someone will be inspired by them, I certainly was. The first three events were highly uncanny and were things that I always say are too unlikely to be coincidences, yet at the same time there was always that few percent chance that they could just be coincidences lurking in the back of my mind. The fourth was hands down, no doubt a spiritual visit from my dad, something he made obvious was him. 

1st experience-

I was driving to work one morning with my carpooler in the passenger seat. My brother, crying heavily, called and told me. The news put me in a kind of shock, my mind just went blank basically, my chest and throat tightened up and I could barely talk. The fact that I was driving on the highway at 70 mph in heavy traffic didn't help either. Yes, I admit I answered my cell phone while driving, bad I know. Somehow, I choked out to my brother that I couldn't talk and I would be at the hospital with him and his family asap, dropped my carpooler off and headed back on the 45 minute drive. As I drove, my thoughts and emotions gradually came back to me. By the time I was going down the steep mountain pass halfway back, I was in turmoil, crying and sobbing uncontrollably. Suddenly, I felt my dad's voice in my mind telling me ""I'm already gone, don't kill yourself."" I didn't hear this, but felt it come from nowhere into my mind. As soon as I felt this, I realized I was barreling down the pass at about 20 mph over the limit and slowed down to a safe speed. Also, as I felt his voice, an extreme feeling of calm came over me instantly. I'm a high-strung person and usually, it takes me a long time to calm down from being that upset, so it was very strange and comforting. I know I'm admitting a bad thing about myself with these driving habits, but it's an important part of what happened. 

Like I mentioned, I thought this could have just been my subconscious mind in a moment of extreme emotion while my dad was all that was on my mind. But wait until you read what happened next.

2nd experience-

This one may sound a little goofy at first, but it seems like each experience became more obvious, more of a sign to us (my daughter saw this one. She and my wife both saw the 3rd one). 

My daughter and I like to watch cartoons together on youtube. About 4 nights after my dad passed, we were thinking of what to watch. All the sudden, Mr. Magoo popped into my mind. We had watched a couple episodes of the original series about a year and a half previously, but I hadn't even thought of it since. We watched the first episode that came up on the search. Within the first minute, it shows Mr. Magoo driving into ""Wide Sands Rocket Range"" which is obviously supposed to be White Sands Missile Range. Now, the uncanny thing is that I work there, and I moved back from out of state to take the job so I could be close to my dad! He passed away 6 days before I started. 

It gets better- Magoo stops at the gate to talk to a military policeman, who then let\'s him by. The scene ends with a full frontal salute from the policeman. My dad was an MP there before he retired! My jaw almost hit the floor when I saw this and I started thinking ""what the heck are the odds?!?"" This is when I really started thinking spiritual activity might be afoot. I printed out the full page salute scene and have it hanging in my hobby room/'man cave' 

3rd experience-

This one was impressive, epic I would even say. My two brothers and I had decided to spread my dad's ashes in the local mountains like he had told my younger bro he wanted long ago. As teenagers, my bros and I had camped once in a certain spot and ran out of water. Our dad knew we hadn't taken enough and hiked a 6 gallon container out to us. 

We decided to spread the ashes in that area, but one brother changed his mind and wanted us to meet him at a more easily accessible spot. Now, this is going to sound incredible, and I don't know if I would believe it if someone else told me; but as my wife, daughter and I were driving toward the mountains, we saw a rainbow shaped like the letter V. It was a little above the mountains and was actually moving down, pointing to the area where my dad had brought the water to us! 

Later, when we opened the container of my dads' ashes, my brother read the inscription and said 'It has V as his middle initial'. His middle initial is W. We hadn't told anyone what we saw.

Once again, the power of the mind to bring up doubts is amazing. Even though I knew deep down it was his spirit, I had that same slight feeling in my mind that I might be seeing things I want to see by knitting together chance events with wishful thinking.

4th experience-

One night, several months after he passed, my daughter and I were in the living room, she was on the couch watching a cartoon and I was standing behind the couch watching too. My wife was taking a shower on the other side of the house. One of our cats was asleep in the bedroom on the other side of the house and the other was lying on the rug in front of the couch. The kitchen sink counter is about 20 feet away from the couch, behind that; there is our dining corner with 3 big windows looking out on the back yard. 

It was a calm evening and everything was pretty quiet, the volume on the TV was low. Suddenly my head jerked instinctively toward the windows because I heard a very loud, fast knocking from that general area, 5 or 6 knocks. Usually, I would freak out if someone did that in the night and worry that it was a criminal trying to get in, but it sounded more like it was inside the house than outside, and almost immediately after I looked over there, I noticed a dishwashing brush on the kitchen counter rocking back and forth very fast.

 For some reason, I instantly forgot about the knocks. It seemed like the possibility that there was any danger dropped completely from my mind, and the fear along with it. I just stared at the brush as it rocked for a few seconds and gradually stopped. It was as if I immediately knew it was a spiritual movement, because it was physically impossible otherwise. No windows or doors were open to cause a breeze. The house wasn't shaking because no other objects moved at all. My daughter saw the brush move before me and said that it was moving super fast when she first noticed it and that ""A power was moving it and then let it go."" Amazing how kids perceive these things isn't it?

Our cat always gets very nervous when she hears sudden knocks and would usually have jumped up and freaked out because this was a very startling and loud knocking, but strangely, she didn't seem to worry about it. My dad used to take care of her, so maybe she knew that it was just granddad? 

My daughter and I both tried to move the brush as fast as we saw it rocking, but it was impossible to make it move anywhere near as fast. Also, when it rocked ""by itself"", it was stuck exactly to one spot. When we tried to rock it really fast, we couldn't do it without it sliding around a bit. 

If just the knock had happened, with no visual confirmation, I would have written it off as a neighborhood kid pulling a prank, knocking hard on a window and running away.

I told my daughter to write the date and time down in her diary so we could remember when it happened. 

One strange thing looking back is that for the first few days after, the possibility of it being my dad didn't really come to mind! I was thinking that maybe one of the previous owners had passed away and was visiting her/his house one last time (We bought the house from a couple in their late 80s). Or it could have been a friend of mine in his 70s who is currently in prison. I checked both of these possibilities and no, all were still living.

I suppose that the unsure part of me really needed to be shown for sure because after this I found myself looking every day at a photo of my dad and myself that my wife had put on my dresser shortly after he passed. I started talking to him. I felt kind of silly sometimes, but I would ask him every day to give me a definite sign if the things that had happened were done by him. Maybe he could change some detail of the picture to let me know for sure, that would be impressive, I told him. Over the course of a couple of weeks or so, I memorized every tiniest detail of the photo and suggested things that he might change to show me a sign for sure, maybe have only one pinecone in his hand instead of two, or make himself wearing his glasses instead of them being in his shirt pocket? 

Well you know what? My dad seems to be more creative than me. One day, I thought of something obvious in the picture that I hadn't paid much attention to before. In the bottom right corner is a date and time stamp with the bottom half cut off. I had seen it a dozen times, but for some strange reason never thought to check the date and time! It was a little hard to read at first, but it was 11/26/2009. That was Thanksgiving Day that year. The proverbial light bulb went off over my head (finally!) and I yelled to my daughter who was down the hall in her room ""Hey, look in your diary, what day did we see that brush rocking by itself?"" 

A minute later she said ""It says 11/26"". The wonder of whole series of experiences came full circle to me. I asked her what time she had written down. She said 6:02 or 6:03. The picture says 5:57. OK close enough I thought. When it happened, there was a short delay of maybe a couple minutes before I told her to write the day and time, and clocks are often a few minutes off, so it looks like he pretty much got it synchronized with the picture on the mark! 

This experience showed me firsthand that time is not what we think it is, the future, past and present kind of seem to happen at the same time, or in any chosen order. My dad was a long time player of role playing games and he loved being a ""dungeon master"" when he played Dungeons and Dragons games with his friends even before most people had home computers. 

We would sometimes talk about what we thought happens after death. A few years ago after I told him I think there are endless copies and versions of every person in our infinite universe, he told me that when he goes, he'll be looking down from somewhere in the infinite universe and he would ""mess around with people"" like a real life dungeon master."
"Mr. Riggs Walks 2","Kentucky","Pets / Animals","In November of 2017 I submitted a story to YGS regarding my departed Schnauzer, Mr. Riggs. He had returned from death to visit his home and family. Last heard from Halloween night of 2017, I thought him gone for good. Apparently I was wrong. There are indications that he has returned.

This story is about that return;and, I think, more.

I want to tell you about this experience because what happened is absolutely real, and real encounters are what YGS is about. Still, I don't quite know how to explain what took place. I can manipulate words well enough to tell the story. I just don't know how the story I am sharing with you is possible.

There was more death. That is the best place to start. The last of my 3 Schnauzers passed on October 19, 2018. Known as ""The Rascal,"" or simply ""Rascal,"" his death was expected due to illness. Still, his passing was ugly, and came sooner than we anticipated. Once again we experienced grief, sorrow and tears at the loss of a beloved pet.

But Rascal's death is only a small part of the story. There are more interesting things to share with you.

Here is some information that will help you understand what took place before Rascal passed. Rascal had a morning routine that I had to be attentive to, in part because he was blind and needed help. The routine included, feeding, watering, medication and being put outside. After all those things were done I would head to the shower to start my day.

About 3 weeks before Rascal passed, I heard clicking canine toenails in the hallway outside my bathroom door. This meant Rascal was making his way down the hallway to be let out into the backyard. Our home has laminated flooring and the sound of a walking dog can be heard quite clearly. I opened the bathroom door and saw nothing. Rascal was nowhere to be seen. It didn't occur to me at the time, but I had just heard the same sounds I had described in the story ""Mr. Riggs Walks."" To be honest, Riggs never crossed my mind. I thought him long gone and only a memory. The clicking sounds in the hallway repeated 2 or 3 times during that week.

Two weeks before Rascal's departure the clicking in the hallway seemed to gain momentum. It continued at an increased rate. It always happened when I went to shower. Rascal was seldom the reason for the sounds as he was nearing his death and his behavior was changing. During this second week of toenail tapping the occurrences had more or less doubled.

The week before Rascal died the sounds of tapping toenails grew still more frequent. The day before Rascal passed it happened 5 times in 40 or 45 minutes. I checked on Rascal each time and he had not left his bed. It appeared he had not even moved. His routine had been abandoned and he refused to eat or drink. I knew Rascal was in trouble and we were nearing the end.

I didn't know what to make of the noises in the hallway. I was annoyed at having my showers interrupted. Failure to get Rascal outside would mean cleaning up a mess. And because he was blind we were very attentive to his needs. Rascal was the priority and the clicking a nuisance. My previous experience with Mr. Riggs was never considered. I wondered if our cats were doing something that created those sounds. Even as I write this I question my own behavior. All I can say is my concern was for my dog and a hot shower to start my morning. Then, finally, a cup of coffee.

We took Rascal to our vet after he took a turn for the worse. His doctor had been treating him for months and was very familiar him and his condition. Rascal's doctor was joined by another veterinarian and together they examined him, then said it was time. After all our efforts to provide and care for him, it appeared Rascal had developed cancer of the liver or spleen. In Rascal's best interest his life was gently brought to a close. Our hearts were broken yet again. You see, he was not just a dog, he was the last of our family. Our home took on the feel of a tomb. It was as though sorrow hung in the still air. All 5 of our friends were now gone.

There were times when I was alone that I cried out in anguish, as though my soul was emptying itself of grief and torment. It was involuntary, and when it happened I did not recognize my own voice. I heard and met a new me, an unfamiliar self. This the result of realizing my family dead.

Yes, I know. Not very manly of me. After all, they were only dogs, those 5 who had been a large part of my family since 1974. They had shared my life, even my bed, for more than 40 years. They were only dogs, but we had bonded in an inexplicable way. We were pals and more. We shared a lot of love, those pals and I. Now they are gone.

After Rascal died everything fell into place, though it took a little time to put it together.

I think Mr. Riggs returned and walked the hall. He was, I suspect, warning me of Rascal's coming departure. More importantly, I think Mr. Riggs was coming for Rascal, to accompany him, or perhaps, to lead his friend to what comes next. They had lived their lives together and were like brothers. I think they loved one another, and that their love continues beyond the grave.

But this is not the end of the story. There is more.

During the nights of 21, 22 and 23 November, 2018 I was visited in my bedroom by the spirit of a dog. Call it a ghost if you like. Whether I awoke in order to experience this, or was awakened by it, I do not know. The first night I heard 3 irregular and slow footsteps on our bedroom floor, which is also laminated flooring. It was as though the dog was unsure of himself. The second night there were also 3 footsteps, more certain this time, though slow, like the dog was searching for something. The surprise came when I heard the dog sniff several times, then snort as though clearing his nose. The third night I heard 3 quick, steady footsteps which seemed to say ""I'm out of here!,"" then silence. Yes, I heard the toenails clicking against the floor. Each visitation was between 3:00AM and 4:00AM, with 3:15 and 3:35 being two specific times that I recall. The sounds came from the foot of our bed, near the side I sleep on. Rascal's bed is still located near the foot of our bed.

I think the late night caller was Rascal. Perhaps I was given the farewell we could not share at his passing, as he had been anesthetized to control his pain.

There is little else to tell. I have no substantive knowledge about ghosts or hauntings, and very little experience with the dead. I can offer you no real explanation as to the how or why this happened, only speculation. What I can say with certainty is this did, in fact, happen to me."
"The Famous Cat Named Spaulding","North Carolina","Pets / Animals","If the title puzzles you it is a Groucho Marx reference, if that doesn't help catch the movie Animal Crackers (1930).

In our soon to be 28 years of marriage we have shared our lives with a dozen furry roommates. Only two of them were ""only children"" and for both of them it only lasted a very short time. Something like twenty years ago we picked up Spaulding at the local animal shelter; he was two days away from termination. Spaulding joined a family of four much older pets and over time he became the last pet. He also developed what our vet referred to as epilepsy (though the vet continued to maintain that cats don't get epilepsy). He went a daily medication to prevent seizures, that medication in turn damaged his liver and the medication to remedy that added to his arthritis. Because of this we could not leave Spaulding alone overnight, the result was that Spaulding would go RVing with us (we have a trailer which is currently parked on a permanent site on Hatteras Island). 

While Spaulding was young enough we added a dog and two more cats to our family. He got along with them well enough. The dog and he would join us in the trailer when we went down for weekends. One interesting thing was that Spaulding would not allow the other cats on our bed. We found this odd especially since he had shared the bed with a variety of the older cats. When we came back from the trailer we would know that the newer cats had been on our bed, but they never got on the bed when Spaulding was in the house. Other than that the family seemed to get along pretty well.

About seven years ago Spaulding passed away. For the next two or three years the two remaining cats never got on the bed. From time to time my wife would think we were joined, but there never was a cat. Whether this was her imagination or a manifestation of Spaulding (or one of our other cats) I can not with confidence say. The Cuddlewife was always of the opinion that Spaulding was keeping his sisters off the bed, I have never been able to pin her down on this other than ""It's a feeling I have..."".

Because of Spaulding we got in the habit of taking a cat with us to our trailer. The bigger more adventurous cat now has this duty. The weekend prior to American Thanksgiving we spent our last weekend of the year at our trailer. Due to some odd logistics we could not take the cat with us. On both Friday and Saturday nights The Cuddlewife believes we were joined by Spaulding in our bed in the trailer. Our dog is just too darn large to be confused with a cat. Had this happened one night I could easily write it off as imagination, but two nights in a row - a tad harder."
"A Few Happenings","Missouri","A Haunted Life","Each story of mine is only a brief explanation long so I'm putting them together; I'm wishing for more frequent and longer experiences, though!

The first happened a few years back. My younger sister and I were sitting on our back patio listening to music and relaxing while my parents were at the other end of the house in the garage. In the middle of our house is a long hallway with the laundry room. I should add now, I personally believe each encounter I'm about to share has something to do with my grandfather that passed away five years ago.

 While outside, I would make frequent trips into the house to grab something to drink or snack on, and I never saw my parents come inside the house, or anywhere near the laundry room. It was around ten at night and we came inside to get ready for bed; I made a trip into the laundry room to grab my clothes that had finished drying. Pooled on top of the washing machine, dripping down the front of it, was blue soap. I thought nothing of it, just that the soap container had fallen and spilled. Except then I noticed the position in which the container was sitting: upright, on top of the laundry machine, next to the spot the soap was pooling. I picked up the container and went to set it back on the wooden shelf where it stays and noticed there was soap on the self, as well. It looked as though someone had intentionally grabbed the soap container, poured it onto the shelf and the top of the washing machine, then set the container down, standing upright, on top of the machine.

The next happened almost a year ago, on my nineteenth birthday. The night before the official day was a full moon in my sun sign, Sagittarius. I'd wanted to spend it outside under the moonlight, and while doing so I couldn't help but think about my grandfather, and the experience my aunt Amanda said she had regarding his ghost.

 I'm not going to try and recite her story word for word because it isn't mine and I didn't see it for myself, but she did mention my grandfather going outside and pointing at the sky after having looked into the telescope we kept close to the backdoor. After some reflection on her story, I chanced a look up at the sky and at that moment saw a shooting star. Nothing paranormal, granted, and this story might not have any paranormal elements at all, but I'll leave that up to you to decide. Personally, I have no relative explanation for what happened. 

After the shooting star, I began to make my way inside as it was around midnight. Just then, I began to hear what sounded like cheerful fair music. This is the bit I can't explain. I live in the countryside, my home is completely surrounded by thick forest. The direction in which the sound was coming from, was a particularly dense portion of forest, the only thing on the other side being the home of an old farmer. I walked closer to the sound, but it didn't fade away, or get louder. It went on for about three minutes, then stopped abruptly. I should add my birthday is considerably close to Christmas, which could potentially explain the cheerful music, but doesn't explain the odd time and placing for it.

The final experience I have to share, so far, is something that happened about a month ago. It was around eight in the evening and I was sitting on my couch reading while the tv played in the background. The remote was sitting next to me, on the other cushion, not being touched. Suddenly, the tv went black as it changed channels. I looked at the remote, which was still untouched on the cushion next to me, in plain sight. I watched as the tv switched to a channel that plays music and thought maybe one of my family members was trying to frighten me. I turned around and looked behind the couch, peeked into the hallway, called for them, but there was absolutely no one there. My sister came from inside of her room asking what I needed while we both watched as my parents came inside from the garage. I thought it best not to mention this to anyone, but as I sat back down and grabbed the remote to try and switch it back to the original channel, I became intrigued. I'd wanted to hear what the music was, so I pressed the volume button to turn it up. The volume raised about two notches before the remote stopped working in my hand. I stared at the tv in confusion as the volume bar began decreasing; remote in my hand, no buttons being pressed, tv in front of me, no one manually pressing buttons, all family members accounted for. My sister took notice of what was going on and the volume decreased to zero. Once again, I began to try my luck with the remote, to turn the volume up, or switch the channel, and it still wasn't working. The remote wasn't dead as we soon found out; about five minutes later it began working again as if nothing happened. We were all a bit unsettled so we didn't speak further on the matter and went to bed soon after. A week ago my curiosity got the better of me and I scrolled through our tv guide to track down the music channel. I found it, had a listen, and was further amazed when my grandmother heard the music and stated that it was exactly what my grandfather loved to listen to.

I hope you enjoyed these experiences as I did; they're curious and some even touching to my heart. I hope and look forward to more experiences to share here!"
"Ghost Girl Caught On Camera?","New York","Ghost Hunting","I was visiting my girlfriend in PA one time, and she tells me of this haunted church about a half hour's drive from her house in the town of Burlington. Being interested in the paranormal, I am excited to go. The church is surrounded by a cemetery and has two floors and was decommissioned 30 years ago but it's privately owned and maintained and is open to the public day or night. I was excited and scared at the same time. 



I felt vibes, heard sounds, even had a door close on us. We also took several pictures of the place hoping to catch something. Still, I figured I'd never be lucky enough to get anything on camera, but In one of them I noticed a mist in the trees. I thought it may have just been fog as it was a cloudy morning, but I showed it to my girlfriend anyways, and she says to me ""good job, you caught a ghost on your camera"" I said ""you think so? It may just be fog"" She replied ""no, look on the gravestone"" I looked and my jaw freaking dropped. 

There on one of the headstones was a figure of a girl in a dress, you can see the head, eyes, hair, shoes, even the belt on the shoes. (you can also see the mist I mentioned in the trees just above it) It kind of looks like she's holding something too. I was shaking for a few minutes afterwards, so exciting and scary. If you don't see it, its near the center, just to the right of that fence. The only thing I have done to this picture was zoom in to make it easier to see. This picture was taken April 19th 2017 at 8:51 AM facing southeast off the front deck of the church with a camera from a Kyrocera Brigadir phone. What do you think of this picture?"
"Evidence Gathered On A Research Project In Marietta, Ga","Georgia","Ghost Hunting","I have been asked over the last 39 years of Research if ""Ghosts"" are Real.

Well...they say a picture is worth a Thousand Words.

I was asked to look into Reports of Strange activity at the Old Marietta Cemetary in Marietta GA some years back.

I assembled a Team of Volunteers who were Interested in Paranormal Activity Research, and Emplaced Cameras (42 of them), EMF Field Sensors, Thermal field Sensors, Motion Detectors, and Digital/Analog Recording Devices.

At 2:30 on the Saturday morning, I decided to do a Field Sweep for Datum, and take some 35mm shots behind the Sexton's House. I was doing it because of the Sensor ""hits"" that were occurring in that area. I was utilizing a Canon EOS 35mm Camera body with a 50mm lens, ASA 800 Sepia film, utilizing No Flash in order to gather Datum in the Ambient light.

After completion of the Datum portion, we broke down and packed the Equipment. Upon returning to my Office, I began to evaluate the Datum.

It was readily apparent that some Significant Activity had occurred, because of the Frequency if spikes in the EMF Field logs, and ""hits"" on the Thermal and Motion Sensors. In Addition, several photos had emerged that defied ""normal"" explanation.

I decided to have the roll of 35mm film that I had exposed that Saturday morning Developed in a One Hour shop. Upon returning to the shop, the attendant was extremely nervous. I inquired as to her discomfort. She stated the Developed exposures had one showing a Lot of ""something"" going on. She went on to say at first glance it appeared the camera had moved during the exposure... But discovered the Tombstones were Not Blurred... Indicating the camera was Steady.

She asked what was the setup on the camera, and I told her. She was taken aback at the No Flash statement. Knowing that I am an old Researcher, she asked if she was looking at a picture of Many ""ghosts""... 14 in all. I replied that it was a Distinct possibility.



I went back to that are in the Daylight hours the next day to record the names on the tombstones in that area. I then visited the Newspaper in the area to obtain, if available, Obituary photos of the names I had gathered.

Having gathered the Information and photos, I set about Analyzing the Photo. I was able to Identify Positively 3 of the Entities in that photo.

I then sent a copy of that photo, with the Negative, to an old School friend who was the Head of the Physics Dept. At a University. I asked him to Analyze the photo, and form his Conclusion. 3 weeks later, He called and told me it was the Real thing and Proof Positive of the Existence of "" Ghosts""...and wanted to know what I had photographed. I replied that it appeared to be a Nexxus... A rift in the boundary between this Dimensional Plane and the Parallel (black energy) Dimension.

I went on to say that I didn't know exactly how the conditions were Nominal at the Time to capture that Image... But I would find out. And if he expected me to Replicate that shot... He was on a Drug!

If I can figure out how to attach a copy of that photograph on this Site, I shall do so.

It took another 2 years of digging (some of the Data I needed I already had and was overlooking)...but as a Result of that shot and the Conditions therein present, I was able to Objectively Determine the EXACT POINT on the PKE Index that Pure Living Energy TRANSMUTES to a Corpreal Form of Matter that can be seen, felt, and photographed.

That Project, and the Information gained therein, has opened up a Lot of Exciting possibilities in Matter Transfer and Time Transfer.

What may be considered ""science fiction"" Today will be Science Fact in the Future."
"Odell Ghost","Oregon","Photographs / Videos / EVP","As a long time employee at a resort in Oregon that was established in 1903 this the first experience for me with the paranormal. This resort has a very long history. I was sitting at my front desk late in the evening which I have done many times over the years. The time was a about 11pm pacific time though on the video it shows eastern time zone which is what our security cams are set for. I had been in the lodge most of the evening watching football and such going in and out the back door a few times. I am sitting at the desk playing on facebook as I usually do this time of night, when our back door swings open! The lodge is closed at 8pm every night so you don't have people running around trying to get in. There is no wind this particular night all doors were tightly shut and there is no history of this door opening randomly at any time in all the years I have been here! As the door opens I slowly turn my head assuming that some one must be walking in. When the door shuts on its own.

I walk over peer out and of course no one! I have security cams all over the inside of the lodge so after sitting back down I decided to see if I was losing my mind or if that just happened! I backed up the security camera footage and sure enough it happened! This something I cannot explain. I have reviewed all angles and there is nothing there! I have added a video of the footage for everyone to watch and also try and explain! 



Please let me know what you think! Please watch my actions in the video which will tell the whole story."
"Handprint Of A Ghost?","Illinois","Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations","This happened on September 23, 2018, around 10 A.M. Or so. 

It was a Sunday morning, and my roommate was at Service, so my cat and I were enjoying some uninterrupted TV time. I was enjoying a scary movie (my 'guilty' pleasure) with the drapes drawn and lights off for atmosphere. When out of nowhere, 3 loud bangs came from the wall behind me and to my right. Both the cat's and my heads whipped around to where the noise came from. Although, the room is dim, it is not dark at all, and there's nothing to be seen. 

Perhaps the slight tingly feeling I'd had was not movie induced after all, I thought to myself and said, ""Hello?"" aloud. I knew I was the only one in the building at the moment. The downstairs neighbors had gone to the city taking their dog with. So, it wasn't something they were doing. 

I went back to watching the movie, and again I hear ""bam! Bam!"" like someone hitting the wall flat handed. Again I stare at it. The other side of that wall is the bathroom, and it sounded like the sound originated from there.

Off I go to investigate. 



The bathroom door opens inward, and I discovered what clearly appears to be a white handprint on the wall that's behind the door when opened. The same wall, I heard the banging on. It's in an illogical place; if you had your hand there, you wouldn't be able to open or close the door. It appears to be of the left hand, and is too large to be mine or the roommate's.

An interesting note, is you can tell that at some point there had been a door there. You can see a faint outline where they hadn't filled it in properly with joint compound. The handprint is almost in the center of the upper half - where one would hit if trying the handle at the same time. 

I stared at what was undeniably a handprint for a long time. When you're on the toilet you face that wall, and I knew that it had not been there before. It was so white it stuck out like a sore thumb. 

I went and got my cell to snap a picture, before doing a more physical examination of the print that might alter it, or for all I knew it might even just disappear. While snapping the pic, I talked to the air. No responses though. 

Except for the coldness of the wall, there was no 'feel' to the print; slightly oily, or powder residue, etc. Didn't smear when I rubbed it either. Nor did I detect any emotion with it, at least none that might not be my own: a bit of nervousness, slight annoyance.

Later, I easily wiped the print off using just a cloth a water - no scrubbing at all. So far it hasn't returned either, but then again this apartment seems to experience a lot of one off things."
"Shadow People And A Little Girls Voice","Florida","Shadow People","Hey readers I am here to stop by because I wanted to give an update about somethings that have been going on. 

Things have been going missing lately around our house. One morning I am getting ready for the day with my husband and we are about to leave for the day and I can't find the car keys. In our bed room I have a white vanity table to do my makeup, and in the left bottom drawer I always put the car keys in there and they weren't in there. We looked everywhere. I had to go down to our basement and get the extra spare car keys so we could leave. 

At night time, when we get home the keys are laying outside or house door that we would have had to walk right over the car keys when we left the house. My husband and I and our children would have had to step on the keys. We would have seen them. So weird. Now I always try to be logical. I am a firm believer in the paranormal but I always look for another reason first. So who knows I could have dropped the keys the day before and not realized, or when we all the left the house that morning maybe none of us saw the keys on the ground. 

Other things go missing as well.

My husband and myself have seen shadow people in our room late at night. The shadow people that I have been seeing in the last few weeks on and off are shadows, that move quickly across the room. Of course we are not 100 percent sure it is a shadow person but we both believe it is. We have seen shadow people in our bed room a few other times before. 

My daughters have sleepovers. Sometimes it feels like every weekend my daughters, have someone over and one of the girls brought a ouija board and I was not aware of it until the next morning. It's not something I really want my children playing with. I told them the dangerous if it and to take it seriously if your going to be daring enough and use the board. 

Last night, I kept hearing a little girls voice talking but I couldn't hear what she was saying. One of my daughters says that she thinks she hears a little girl in her bedroom. I wasn't sure if maybe it was a dream until I heard it too. 

Just some of the things that have been going on. 

Sincerely ❤️Mrs Rizzo"
"Big Black Dog","California","Pets / Animals","When I was around 15 or 16 years old, I was alone at home because my family had gone to a party. My mom was very hesitant to let me stay by myself because they were going to be out pretty late. I remember pleading with her and telling her I needed to get some homework done and I didn't feel well to be out at a party. She finally agreed to let me stay on the condition that I stay inside, didn't answer the door for anyone and if anyone were to call on the phone I didn't tell them I was home alone. I agreed to all, so my parents and siblings left around 6:00pm with the promise to return at midnight. I was ecstatic to have the house all to myself, I had the music on full-blast, made a mess in the kitchen and stayed on the phone with my best friend. 

Next door to my friend lived one of the popular kids from school who had friends over and they were hanging out with skateboards. My friend was looking out the window while she was on the phone with me telling me what they were doing. She kept insisting I come over, she only lived a couple of blocks from me. I made the bad decision to go over to her house, I told myself that I was going to pretend to just drop something off to her and maybe just say for 10 minutes and then run back home. It was early enough, I could do this... Well, I got to her house and when she saw me approaching she snuck out and we stayed talking for a few minutes. Of course the guys saw us and told us to come over to hang with them. I remember the flirting, the giggling and trying to ride on their skateboards, I was having the time of my life. One of the neighbors came out and told us to be quiet, we were making a lot of noise and it was late. That's when it suddenly hit me, I was in so much trouble! I told everyone I had to go and took off running like crazy. 

All the way over to my house I was praying that my dad's car wasn't parked in the driveway. I remember running and mumbling ""please, please, please don't let them be there"", and then when I was close and didn't see a car I changed to ""thank you, thank you, thank you"". Well, my happiness was short lived, blocking my way to get into my yard was a HUGE black dog.

 I use to be afraid of dogs, I never had one as a pet growing up, it also didn't help that this dog was huge, looked pissed-off and was growling at me. I crossed the street and kept walking thinking that I could go around him but it was as if he knew my intentions and his were to not let me pass. I stood there for a long while trying to think of a plan but in every one of them I ended up being mauled by this giant dog. Then I would think about how my parents were coming and what would happen to me for disobeying and I wasn't sure what was worse! I finally went with being mauled to death and decided to go for it. I crossed the street with my head down and my fingers in my ears, I was shaking so bad. I never lifted my head but I knew I was at the door of the gate, I opened it and walked in the yard. I knew I wasn't safe yet because the fence was not that high and somehow I knew the dog would have no trouble jumping over it. I kept walking with chills running up and down my spine and finally got to the front door.

 I made it inside the house intact, shut the door, and immediately went to the window to look out and see what the dog was doing. I didn't see the dog and was on my tip toes trying to look over the fence, that's when I noticed the headlights of my dad's car pulling in the driveway. My nosy sister noticed me and ratted me out to my parents. Of course they asked what I was doing looking out the window so I told them that I had heard a dog barking and had seen a big black dog out there. They told me they didn't see anything and that it was probably a lost or stray because our neighbors didn't have any big dogs. The dog would have had to go inside a neighbor's yard because we lived on a dead end street and my family didn't see it anywhere on the street when they arrived. 

That night was the first and last time I saw that dog and maybe it wasn't anything paranormal but I sure learned my lesson. This is one of the stories that I've never told my family because I know I did something I wasn't supposed to and even now as an adult I know I would still be scolded by my mother. 

Let me know what your thoughts are, paranormal or just a lost dog? By the way, I'm 5'7 and this dog would probably be as high as my waist (standing on all fours)."
"Something Cold","California","Misc","I have mentioned in other stories, or maybe in comments, that lately I've been feeling my bed move when I'm trying to fall asleep. I have even seen my sheets move when I am completely frozen still. I have done some research on the internet to see if this is probably some kind of medical condition. I don't know, maybe some kind of vertigo, even though that wouldn't explain the sheets moving. I have cleansed my room, burnt sage and incense but sadly it still happens. I now try to ignore it because it was really affecting my sleep and therefore my sanity. I would constantly be nodding off at work from lack of sleep and was just overall miserable. I'm used to it by now and nothing else happens so I just let it be. 

Well, about a week ago I woke up in the middle of the night and was about to turn on my side when I felt a really cold sensation on my arm. I'm not sure if it was a gust of wind or if something rubbed against my arm but it was ice cold. I was alert in a matter of a split second. What was probably more strange to me was the terror I felt, I was too scared to move and turn on the lamp, I was even afraid to open my eyes because I didn't want to see anything. I stayed unmoving for what seemed forever, trying to make myself believe that it was probably a gust of wind. But, from where? Door and windows were closed, I have no AC in the room, just a fan that was off. I finally was able to move a little and felt the remote control lying next to me in bed. Somehow the TV noise and the light gave me the courage to open my eyes and look around the room. Everything looked normal. 

Fast forward to this morning, 11/12. My alarm went off, I reach out to my night stand and turn it off. I stay with my eyes closed for maybe 5 minutes and I guess I was beginning to doze off again when I feel a freezing cold gust of wind in my face. I almost jumped off the bed, I sat up and looked around and again, there is nothing off. I don't know what is causing this. Even if it was a gust of wind coming in through a window, I live in California, it is not that freezing cold here. 

The only other thing that has happened several times that is somewhat similar to this is that I have felt a drop of cold water land on my head or back and when I touch I don't feel anything wet. It drives me crazy and have looked this up on the internet to see I can get some ideas of what it can be. I have found nothing to my satisfaction. 

So, I'm here to see if this has happened to anyone or if anyone has any ideas of what it could be?"
"Smelly Visitor","Alabama","Shadow People","It has been a while since I have posted to YGS but return at least weekly to read new postings, even though I stay rather busy at work, and taking grave photos for findagrave.com requests and etc. I have been a licensed funeral director and embalmer for the past 33 years and hold a National License as well as several state licenses. During this time I have also worked as an organ center procurement technician, as well as 7 years for the Helen Keller Eye and Tissue Bank procurement team. I currently work in a south Texas funeral home doing near 1000 cases per year.

 With a little nudging from a YGS friend from South Africa I post another experience here for your review.

 Just Monday evening of this week I had returned to the funeral home around 21:45 to retrieve some personal effects as I was starting vacation on Tuesday. For anyone who has ever felt ""Watched"" while being totally alone in the middle of a 200+ acre cemetery, or anywhere else for that matter, I need say nothing more. This ""You are not alone"" feeling I felt Tuesday evening led to me thinking of an incident that occurred several years ago while working at a funeral home in the north Alabama area.

I had been called to one of our funeral homes rather early in the evening, just about twilight, to meet the county coroner who was bringing in a murder-suicide for our facility to hold. In that part of the state the county coroner had to rely on the funeral homes to hold decedents on a ""rotational basis"" until the families had decided which funeral home to use. After leaving both cases in my care, I went to the funeral home office to appease my curiosity over a couple of cases I had just seen in the prep room. 

While drinking a cup of leftover coffee, alone in the building and relaxing in the lamp's warm glow I read through their folders and death certificates capturing details of their lives until well past sunset, the entire time feeling at total ease and enjoying the opportunity to relax and learn. After 30 minutes or so I returned to my truck and had started home to enjoy the rest of the evening with my family, and perhaps a couple of cold beers.

I could not have gotten more than 10 miles away when I received the call that we would in fact be retaining both cases and to proceed with the embalming process of both. A little upset that I would not get to see my children that evening, nor those cold beers, I reluctantly returned to the funeral home to begin my arduous task. Pulling into the parking lot I sensed the presence of an unwelcome entity on the premises that I had just left not 20 minutes prior. Immediately I realized that my ""home"" feeling was gone, and I was not alone! 

As I began the embalming process on these cases, I felt as though I was being observed or watched from near the door that led from the prep room into the no longer used bedroom that we now used for storage. While I am fully aware that one can lend themselves to delusions, I had not been in that state of mind prior, nor thought that I was at that time. As I started to embalm the murder victim I felt a rush of emotion like I had never felt before, one of immense sadness. As I continued to the alleged perpetrator, still sensing a presence, I began to see what appeared to be a translucent shadow-like being moving along the wall leading to the garage. 

Necrosis is a smell that one cannot soon forget, as anyone who has ever worked in a hospital environment or has attended a loved one with a decubitus ulcer can attest to. But as I observed the shadow, it seemed to stop as if it knew I could see it, move back along the wall from the garage door until it came near the end of the embalming table where I stood. It smelled as if something putrid stood beside me, a smell of decomposition. Once you have worked around it, you NEVER forget. Yet this smell was much stronger than any human decomposition I have ever smelled. As the hair stood up on my arms and neck, and I fought the ""fight or flight"" response, it began to move slowly away toward the garage door until it was gone, taking that odor with it.

 I am not sure what happened there that evening but feel that I was certainly visited by some unworldly entity who may have been there for some reason pertaining to this murder-suicide. I don't know, you tell me, but I didn't stick around to find out once I had completed my task.

 BTW, I never got those beers that evening nor saw my children, but turns out I was not alone in the funeral home this past Tuesday evening either. Some nut had infiltrated the funeral home to leave a message for their funeral director for mom's service that was yet 2 weeks away. Reminiscing and expecting another unearthly visitor, I was pretty rude with her in the process of ushering her from the facilities at 9:30PM, long after everyone had went home for the evening. I felt bad for her and my response the following day and called to apologize.

"Black Hand","Texas","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","Years ago, for Christmas, I had asked Santa Claus for a pair of ""little girl"" high heel shoes. It was all the rage! Lol I remember daydreaming about how wonderful it would be to have such shoes! I would look so great and it would be so much fun. I was so excited I couldn't wait for Christmas. 

Finally, Christmas Eve was here! That night, I could hardly sleep but, I knew I had to or Santa wouldn't come to our house. Morning came at last. 

I jumped out of bed and ran to our Christmas tree. Santa brought me the most beautiful pink plastic high heels anyone had ever seen! I put them on my feet and start parading around the room. I was so happy. 

My mom had gone to the kitchen to start breakfast. I decide to walk to the kitchen so my mom could bask in the loveliness of my shoes. Just I as get to the doorway to the kitchen I notice this black arm that comes out of the door frame. I'm walking very fast so I can't really stop and I walk straight through the black arm that has stretched out across the doorway. 

I'm so scared I stumble and fall breaking the heel of one of my new shoes. I'm scared and crying. I cry not just because I've broken my shoes but, what was the thing I had just seen? I tell my mother about it but she has no idea what to say. 

The horrific experience fades away with the years and several Christmases come and go. 

But what's even stranger is that I see this black arm once more. This time I'm about 12 years old. My brother, sister and I are laying on a blanket under a lovely shade tree. We're discussing God and I'm preaching my little heart out. All of a sudden, the black arm reaches up from the ground and comes around me! I scream and get away from it quickly. 

I tell my mother of the black arm. She says a prayer with me and calms me down. That night, and several nights afterwards, I sleep with my sister.

These two incidents happened to me years ago but I remember them as if they happened yesterday. 

I don't know what this was or if anyone else has ever seen this black arm. All I know is that it happened to me."
"Grandpa's Camera","Oklahoma","Haunted Items","Hey Everyone!

Lately some small odd things have been going on in my home.

Little things that if I hadn't started paying attention, would go by unnoticed. 

As of late because of the cold, wet, weather I have been keeping our furry baby in the lounge room. It's his bedroom nowadays.

On the very end of the room, is a large walk in closet where I keep all of my poetry, kids' art projects, and some of my Grandpa Sonny's things. These are the things I was allowed to take from his home, when we cleaned it out after he passed.

This particular camera still had the film in it. I put it in a box at the back of the closet.

One morning I woke up, started my usual routine. Start the coffee, let the dog out, smoke a cigarette, and take a shower.

I started the coffee, and went downstairs. When I let Tucker out I saw the camera just sitting on the weight bench. I thought it weird to be sitting out like that, but it was early and I put it up.

I go back up stairs and the coffee hadn't started off right so coffee grinds are all over the pot,counter,and floor. I cleaned it up, and made more.

Off to work I went.

A couple days later same routine, and again, the camera is sitting on the floor just outside the closet.

I thought ok maybe Tuck is getting the camera out of the closet, but how? The closet doors are shut.

So I open the doors up and set it on top of some shirts on the highest shelf. I'm thinking ""If it's him I know he can't reach it here"". And continue on with my routine and go off to work.

The same night, Tuck started to whine at the door. So I let him out to pee, but he has no need to go. I let him back in, I go upstairs and shut the door, leaving him there. He starts to whine at the door again.

I go down there to sit with him, and the closet doors are open. I go to close them, and usually he is walking with his body touching my legs. But this time he stayed at the door and watched me from afar.

I close the doors and walk back and open the door, and he flies out so fast I couldn't catch him. I finally caught him and put him in the room with the kids where he slept that night.

The next morning I start my routine and forgot he was in the kids' room.

I go downstairs to let him out, and realize he's not in there and see the closet doors are open and the camera is sitting on the side of the weight bench, on the floor and the film has been partially torn out the camera and torn right in the middle.

I pick it up, wrap it up and put it back in the closet... Disappointed I wouldn't be able to get that developed eventually.

"Grandma Marie","Oklahoma","Family / Friends Visits","In August of 2018 Grandma Marie passed away.

This of whom I'm speaking of in this, my Husband's paternal grandmother.

Before she passed away, over the month before I had started thinking of her quite frequently. 

She would just pop up in my thoughts out of the blue. We had even talked about going to visit her the weekend before she passed.

My husband received that phone call, the morning we were going to visit.

After the funeral and saying our goodbyes, we had arrived home.

All of us, shuffling around the house trying to find something else to dress in.

The dryer is in the lounge room, and I had some clothes still sitting in it, from a previous turn of washing. So we all took turns one by one going in and out of the room.

I was the first to notice her smell. She had a perfume/home smell that only she could make.

I hadn't said anything, I spoke to her in my head, ""ok,I know your here to say goodbye, I hope your finally resting "" and continued on my search for a pair of sweatpants.

Then my oldest son said ""Mom I smell grandma"",I said "" I know she's here"",and he went onto his room, then my husband said it out loud, so the last two kids come running in.

My husbands excuse for this random smell to linger only in one spot was"" oh we must have the smell on our clothes.""

I said ""ok,whatever you believe, but she's here"".

I've had some other experiences but not enough to really write about.

I've been trying to write this since this happened, but when I do something just so happens to go haywire with my phone or I get distracted.

"Because I Talked To It, It Got Worse","California","Haunted Places","I've lived in the same house for many years. Each year something happens, sometimes scary sometimes annoying.

 In a full house of 9 people not everyone has had an experience. My two little brothers have never had an experience. One of little sisters told me she heard whispering once. My other two younger sisters have never seen or heard anything. My older brother says we're crazy.

 My older sister had an experience with a doll that had literally froze her still. She couldn't do anything but scream to the top of her lungs, though nobody heard her for the first 5 minutes, everybody was though.

 My mother knows of their existence, but I think she's holding the rest of her story back.

 My first time was a feeling, nothing more. I thought I was crazy and I was making things up in my head. This went on for weeks. I wanted to ease my own head so I decided to record a conversation with thin air. I thought I was going to get a feeling of relief. It said in a faint whisper,""I want your power.""

 As if I knew what that meant. The feelings stopped shortly after that.

 Some time after, things started moving. Falling, flying, floating, opening, closing. This only happened to me. Back then I didn't understand why. Everyone said I was crazy. My mother who most definitely knows it happened, denied the ghost existence. Then nothing, it just stopped.

 The next year it came back and started moving things behind my back. I was doing dishes, turned and put my cup of milk on the table, turned around and did dishes, turned around, turned back, turned again, my cup was gone. Where did it go? Turned around, my cup is in the sink, still half full. My backpack did the same thing. So I named it ghosty. BIG MISTAKE, Don't name it.

 It started making sounds. Clicking sounds, like with your tongue. I tried to talk to it again, via phone's voice recorder thingie, nothing happened. I checked over it twice. I turned it off and told it ""thanks for nothing ghosty"". Then it said very loudly in clear voice,""You don't need that to hear me.""

 Well, what do you do in the situation that a voice comes out of nowhere and says a full a sentence? I'll tell you what you do, you sit there with a warm liquid feeling in the front of your pants and you don't move until your told to do chores. I started hearing it talk more and more, but eventually, nothing.

 It all just stopped again. Until the next year with pretty much the same story. A few years passed but it only stayed the same. Little things here and there with one big thing before it stopped again. I did a few Google searches, read a book or two, even talked to people about it. One thing helped, the Bible. 

 I'm not a Bible thumper. I believe in God and heaven and hell and all that, but I'm not sitting here to preach. It said not to talk to it. I never talked to it again. Then, nothing, just gone. No more. I mean some whispers came up a while back saying my name until I yelled at it.

 One thing a year now and it happens randomly to anyone here. Nothing big. Since then I learned more about ghosts and the different types. I've helped others with their problems and even solved a few of my own cases. You can't get rid of a ghost. You can however, stop giving the ghost attention and it will stop picking on you."

Not all witches practice so-called ""black"" or harmful magic, and I certainly never have and don't intend to. However, when one begins to learn magic, among the first things they are told to study and apply is protection. As long as proper protection is taken magic is safe--without it, one should be aware that they're opening a door to the other side that they don't necessarily want to be open.

I always believed in ghosts and other spirits, but I didn't believe in that claim--maybe because, in the beginning, I didn't necessarily believe in magic. Regardless, I don't think anything happened until the second or third month of casting a few spells.

My mother used to have a cat that was a little lighter than what's probably average, and he had a habit of wanting to come into my room late at night. I never had a problem with this, but since I preferred to keep my door closed, and he didn't want to be trapped, I ALWAYS made sure that he was outside of my room before I went to bed. That night was no different.

As I laid in bed, I wasn't very tired--more that I was trying to get to the point where I could go to sleep. Perhaps ten or fifteen minutes after the lights had been out, and I was laying there in bed, I felt something hop up from the floor next to my feet. My first thought was the cat, but I KNEW that I had put him out of the room.

I was petrified. I could feel that thing moving along my bed, inching closer to where my head was. I couldn't see it, but in my head I pictured some sort of tiny creature--one that must have been just a bit lighter than my mother's cat, but not by much. I don't know if I can really express to you how creeped out I was. At the time, I had never experienced something quite like this--something that I could not explain, but could *physically* feel.

Once the thing had crawled up towards my elbows, I couldn't take it anymore. I tossed my fear aside and jumped up from the bed and turned the light on. As you might you probably guessed, there was nothing there. I did a cleansing spell that night and it seemed to go away afterwards.

With that said, I'm curious if anyone has any potentially ""logical"" explanations for this? As I wasn't asleep, and not even sleepy, I feel like I can safely say it wasn't hypnagogia or sleep paralysis."
"The Haunted Bonnet","Georgia","Ghost Hunting","As a paranormal investigator I travel the USA in search of Haunted Locations. One day I got a call about a house in Atlanta, Georgia (Georgia is one of the most haunted states in America). I was asked to come out and investigate a house belonging to the McHugh Family.

 I drove down to Georgia and found the house which was located in the middle of nowhere. I drove down an old winding dirt path to get there, and then up a steep hill and when I got to the top, I was greeted by a woman in 18th Century clothing who told me she had been waiting for me. I parked down the road and walked up to the door after the woman led me down the driveway. I turned around to thank her but she had mysteriously vanished into thin air. I was baffled and stood in shock for a couple minutes.

 I knocked on the door and asked if there were any reenactors present to which the woman who had answered replied that there were none. I told her about the lady and she responded that I had encountered the residential ghost of Francesca McHugh, the wife of a medical doctor in the late 18th Century. I went inside and had coffee before conducting my investigation. I was in the kitchen rinsing out my mug when I looked out the kitchen window to see a shadowy figure with no face staring back at me. I wasn't startled but taken aback at the sight of the figure. 

I started by doing an EVP Session. I asked some questions and concluded the session and an hour later I reviewed my recordings (Not Available for listening). I gathered some disembodied voices but couldn't quite tell what they were saying however, I could tell the voices belonged to a female. The woman who answered the door for me earlier gave me a bonnet that belonged to Francesca McHugh, which supposedly had Francesca's spirit attached to it. I asked if I could keep the object to which the woman said I could because she wanted to get rid of it. 

I took the bonnet and put in a glass case in my ""ghost room,"" a room in my house that I keep haunted objects in. I called the family a month later and asked if they were having any other experiences to which they told me they weren't anymore. Satisfied, I started work on this story after getting permission from the house owners. The McHugh Mansion in Atlanta Georgia is a private residence and is not open to the public."
"Interference On Camera","California","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","Note this will be very short. 

So this just happened recently and as I am typing this, I feel like something is outside my house. Not only that, the cameras in the house keep rebooting and the displays keep going to black.

So a little backstory, I'm a 20 years old and while I may be a person who that is friendly and prefers the cute pastel theme, I have a huge interest into the paranormal. The irony of it, however, is that if I even see what seems to be a face of a ghost, I'll run screaming. I'm also from a family who believes in ghosts and are religious. 



Since we believe in the paranormal, we also believe cameras can capture ghosts in action. The cameras at my home have captured a few ghosts, or at least the interference they were causing to the camera.

Anyways, to the story: 

So just a while ago, I was just bringing together my work application, my college transcript, and my recommendation letters to apply for a job at the college I was attending. 

As I finished filling out the application, I noticed something really strange on the camera display. 

A FACE. A FREAKING FACE. 

Or at least an implication of a face. The interference on this camera was strong, and I was freaking out. 

That is not even all. While the face freaked me out, before that, my mom and I also saw a ""red dot"" that just turned into a ""squiggly line"". Afterwards, the camera captured a ghost that appeared to be ""dancing"". I jokingly called the ghost the ""Dancing Man"" for that reason. 

But that face, was it the ""Dancing Man""'s face? If so, why does it show its face onto the camera like that? 

While I do not have a picture of the squiggly red dot, I do have the picture of the face. I don't know, maybe it was a glitch in the camera system, but then why does it resemble a face?..."
"No Kids Allowed","California","Haunted Places","A few years ago when my children were about 7, 5 -1/2 and 4 they were spending the night at their dad's sister's house. Auntie Monica was babysitting that day, my then husband and I were going to a party and were not going to be back until very late so it was decided that the kids might as well just spend the night. We had only been at the party a few hours and even though the party was nice, good food, good friends, good music, we both felt very uneasy. Monica had babysat before so it wasn't that we didn't trust her, there just seemed to be something off. So, we decided to call it a night and head back to Monica's house to get the kids. 

We had the spare keys to the house so we did not knock, it was fairly late so we did not want to disturb anyone. When we opened the front door we were met with a very frightened looking Monica, a teary eyed 7 year-old, and sleeping on the couch was our little ones. I immediately sensed something was not right but didn't ask, we decided to spend the night so we moved the children to the spare bedroom. My 7 year-old would not stay in the room unless daddy stayed with her, so he settled in with her and I went to go talk to my sister-and-law to see what had happened. 

She told me that the kids had been playing in the bedroom when suddenly all 3 came running out looking scared and crying saying that they wanted to leave. Monica asked them what happened but all they said is that they were scared to be there and wanted to go home. She got them to quiet down but was not able to get them to sleep in the spare bedroom. She stayed with them in the living room until the two youngest fell asleep. My oldest kept crying saying she wanted her mommy and daddy, Monica sat with her until she calmed down.

 Monica says that my son started talking in his sleep and my daughter soon followed. She said it was as if they were carrying on a conversation but she couldn't understand anything they were saying. Monica says it got to the point where their voices were raised and they were almost yelling. She went to try to get them to calm down and she said she put her hand on my son's chest and he started lifting his chest like he was trying to get up, even though she wasn't holding him down it seemed like something or someone was holding him down.

 She started praying and just as fast as it started it all stopped, my children went back to sleeping quietly. She told me that she could swear they were both speaking a different language or a mixture of different languages. It scared me a little to hear this but nothing compared to how freaked out she was. 

The next morning my kids were being their normal selves, I decided to wait until we got home to ask questions. All I got out of my oldest daughter was that they were playing in the room and there was a voice that yelled at them and told them to get out. I asked her where the voice was coming from and she said all she knew is that the voice was inside the room with them. I tried to get more out of her but my husband told me to stop and let her forget what happened. 

About two years after that, that room was turned into a nursery for Monica's newborn daughter. The baby did not sleep there for long, they heard her crying one day and when they walked into the room the baby was laying on the floor next to the door. We're talking about a 2-3 month old baby. Even more weird, Monica had to constantly open windows and doors in that bedroom because it always smelled like mold even though there wasn't any. I went in there a couple of times after the baby was born and to me it smelled like something rotting. 

Any ideas what happened to my two young children? Why were they speaking to each other while asleep and in an unknown language?"
"Darker Than The Darkest!","Massachusetts","Misc","Often times when writing, the words just flow as my mind recalls, but not this time. You have no idea how many times I have endeavored to put these words to print. Each time I would end up deleting the whole mess.

Here I am again, still not willing to give up. I will skip over the earlier details, and get right to the dark. The darkest dark I have ever known. Not anything like it being so dark but seeing your far neighbors porch light of in the distance. Not anything like a far distant streetlight, up ahead gleaming from around the curve. Just darker than your imagination can vision. Just dark with the absence of any form of light.

I was confused and frightened, complete bewilderment as to how I have found my way here, where ever here is. I could feel movement, head over feet, or at times a twirl sideways. Without sight, I had to second guess my movements. But wait! There is a dull grey white passing by, I see a hand, is that a wave, then all is the same dark. Is this death? Much further away there was another figure, moving without reason. Will I spend endless time, with my muddled mind, watching others sent to this dark space, I wished for conversation, someone may have an answer.

I have decided to stop the next one I see. I float close and try to grab a hand. Instant panic, with a language I am unfamiliar with. Is this all there is, we do this in the dark until the end of time, this is death. Worse than I my mind could have ever dreamed of. I learned I could somewhat control my movements as I twisted and turned.

Here is another thing about this dark, there is no noise, so I try my version of (appropriately) Twist and Shout. I am really getting into it, when a male voice says near by, ""Hey shut it will ya. We speak for a bit, and he moves off. Interesting, he had a NYC accent. He left me humming Amazing Grace, a favorite of mine. So as I move about this dark, and without fail, I get louder. A base tone joins me, but I can't see him then an alto female joined in, but where were they. The dark wasn't so bad when music was involved. The Sound of music was my next choice, then we sang some of the songs from that musical... Time passed I guess. 

The dark seemed to lift slowly, we all stopped singing. As it got lighter my memory started working better, and I remembered why I was here and who I was, I also felt heavy pain in my stomach area. As my eyes lifted and my happiness returned, here was all my family, all smiles.

I can not speak for others that have been placed into a medically induced coma, I can only tell how it was for me. Eventually the drugs were lifted, I got better, came home, now well on the mend. Much more Chemo to come...

This experience will not leave me, there is more to it. Can anyone explain, or has any of you ever gone through something similar. Can anyone clarify?"
"Is It A Demon/ Witch Craft?","Pennsylvania","Haunted Places","So before you know what happened recently you'll need to know this: My grandfather was crazy into witchcraft voodoo. He used to draw pentagrams on the basement floor, put my aunt, uncle, and mom inside them, perform ""spells"" on them, and then throw them all in a closet. He used to call himself a ""wizard"", and I think that it has affected all of our lives tremendously! My mother ended up passing away very suddenly in her 20's, my uncle is very unhealthy, and my grandmother became a paranoid schizophrenic.

Yesterday was Halloween. I woke up at 2:30 am in a horrible sweat and in the middle of a panic attack. I was having a dream that demons were trying to get me to let them into my soul, and no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't stop thinking about it. (This was NOT sleep paralysis, as I could move.) But I could not get the thoughts out of my head. Then I saw a dark shadow in my closet and I couldn't fall back to sleep for HOURS.

Fast forward to 2:30 pm that day. I just got out of the shower and heard a loud bang on the wall, and the radio turned itself from a radio station it was on, to static, and turned itself all the way up and then back down again.

Now it's the next day and the little girl I babysit keeps apparently telling her mom that she had a friend here named Jeremy. (Nobody here is named that.) And I realized after talking to her today that she is not saying Jeremy, she's saying my mom's name.

I don't know much about demonology, but I do know that sometimes demons pretend to be angels to get what they want from you.

Any input or opinions on this would be greatly appreciated!"
"Spirits Are Around","Florida","Haunted Places","They say things come in threes, and that held true for me when I experienced a trio of weird events while living on Florida's Gulf Coast back in 1989.

A lot was going on then: my fiancé and I had both suffered broken marriages before marrying and moving into her old home. A difficult six-month long remodeling process that left us drained and stressed out soon followed. After completion, moving back into our ""new"", near half-century-old home was hard on us, but it had gone smoothly, and with a planned week off to recharge only a few days away, things were looking up. 

I took the two days off prior to our Friday departure to clean up some urgent work, clear my schedule for the week, and cross off last minute to dos for the trip. My planning was sound, but nothing could have prepared me for what was in store.

A little about the house: it was located on a serene, shady, wooded acre at the end of a private road, a gem that was hard to come by in our densely populated county. Stately live oaks and citrus trees made it very special. An old ""cracker"" cabin that backed up to a stand of mature bamboo stood on the edge of the property. Whomever lived in it back then, surely had led a hard life. The owner/builder had lived in it before he sold it to a wonderful old couple. Many years later they agreed to sell it to my wife-to-be, and she was lucky to get it. 

Wednesday Morning: My wife had left for work, and I was having coffee when I heard a familiar knocking. That would be my in-laws, as usual, I thought. They lived in a home adjacent to our property and announced any visit with three knocks on the window next to the side door into our kitchen. This time when I stood up to go let them in it hit me; they had left town a few days before to visit relatives out of state, so who was knocking? I rushed to the door, and was dumbfounded that no one was there. 

Wednesday Evening: After my wife came home from work, we went to the mall to buy items for the trip. We then ate an early dinner out, so we could get a head start on packing when we got home. A host put us in a corner booth with only a handful of other patrons around, but nobody nearby. We happily sipped our drinks and chatted about the adventure ahead. Suddenly, I felt three taps on my shoulder, and I swung around to see whom it was. I was surprised to find no one there or even close by. When I turned back around my wife asked what was going on, so I told her about the tapping. She said that my body language fit exactly what my explanation suggested. The thing is, she was facing me and could clearly see that nobody was there.

Thursday Morning: After seeing my wife off to her job, work in my new home office went well, but I ran into a glitch. I desperately needed a certain file to finish up; it was a blue folder, and easy to spot, or so I thought. The file held all my notes and the only copy of a speech I had written for my boss, who had to have it that afternoon. I wrote it over the previous three weeks, and after one final review and edit, it would be finished, but if I didn't meet the boss's deadline, I would be finished. There wasn't enough time to recreate it without blowing our vacation, so I searched feverishly everywhere, but no luck. I prayed to find it, and as a last resort, I knelt to check a shelf under my desk where I found a paper I needed later, but no blue file. Disgusted, I reached up and slapped the single sheet down on the desktop above, and broke for lunch.

When I returned to my office later, I sat down at my desk and decided to call my wife. I was desperate and maybe she knew something about the missing file. I reached for the phone, and got the shock of my life when I did; THE BLUE FILE WAS SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF MY DESK! An electric charge shot up my spine and my eyes locked wide open searching the room for an answer as to how the file got there. I had a bad case of butterflies, and truly, the hair on the back of my neck stood up. My hands instinctively grasped the top of my head as it shook back and forth in disbelief, and I mumbled ""No way!"". How did the file get there, and how could the paper I had slapped down on the desktop a bit earlier, be underneath? It was totally unnatural, and scary.

Could these events have simple explanations? I suppose. Even though I swear I heard the sound of knocking at the window, it could have been various random house noises, and my imagination taking over. Could the taps on my shoulder have been nothing more than muscle twitches even though it felt genuinely like a person was doing it? Maybe, but as for the blue file - no way can I explain that! No one knew what I was doing in my office that morning except me, and nobody else was in the house. I did not find, touch, or move any blue file and yet it appeared on my desk. Files do not move themselves, so how could that happen?

For the remainder of time we lived in that house, the area by the entrance to my office always felt colder than other rooms, even though there was no A/C vent nearby, or any other known cold air source. 

Maybe the renovation project had disturbed a friendly spirit who wanted me to know they were still around by reaching out, and doing me a big favor to save my job. For that, I will be forever grateful. In any case, we have since moved to another city and maybe the spirit (s) moved on too. Nothing eerie, unusual, or unexplained has happened since then, but if it did, I would not be too surprised. I believe that spirits are around!"
"Garage Investigation","Tennessee","Haunted Places","(To understand this story I'm going to tell you that, in addition to me, there were Jasper and AJ. Jasper was my best friend for several years, and I usually refer to him as my childhood best friend. We split because he was inviting a lot of negative energies into his life, and I felt like we were no longer compatible--but at this time AJ was his fiance. Both are male. Once AJ and I stopped associating with Jasper, we became best friends. I hope that's not too confusing.) 

AJ and his family now live in Colorado, but less than a year ago they lived in a house that was something of a hot spot for paranormal activity (although, I personally believe that it was more about the land than the house itself). When he was a teenager and was dabbling with things he shouldn't have been dabbling with, AJ would feel watched, and sometimes smelled rotten eggs.

 A few years back, when the house was very crowded, he set up his bedroom in the garage, but quickly found that he would hear footsteps from the room above it quite often. Shadow people were in abundance, and strange dreams that were sometimes bordering on the paranormal were scattered all throughout the time he spent there. Just a year or so ago he watched what appeared to be the spirit of his father (who had died in that house) walk around.

Now, you have to understand that by the time the two of them met, Jasper was already surrounded by a great deal of paranormal activity. When they moved in together at that house, the experiences only intensified. (Quick side note: If you're interested in reading a story related to Jasper that took place towards the beginning of his experiences, you can read Evil in the Corner.) 

I believe that it all started a few years before that, when he found a blue stone that he was very attached to. Jasper always told me that some part of him felt something was ""off"" about the stone, but at the same time he couldn't get himself to leave it alone. I remember one time I did try to take it away from him, very casually. That night he hadn't been paying attention to it at all, and I remember being a bit creeped out when I slipped it in my pocket. As soon as he came back to the room he realized that the stone was gone, and accused me of hiding it. He hadn't been angry, exactly, but more hopeful that it would be that simple, and vaguely agitated. I did give it back to him.

After that I didn't think too much about the stone until after he moved in with AJ. He had sworn up and down, left and right, that he left the stone in Mississippi when he was packing, but found that it was there in Tennessee. I assumed he was either pulling my leg or had been mistaken, and AJ (who is fairly sensitive to energies) didn't pick anything up from it, so I wasn't very concerned.

It was spring break, and I was all set up to spend the week with the two of them. Within the first couple days, I woke up to find that Jasper was already awake, and staring at one of the windows. When I asked him what he was doing, he said that ""it"" was there, and described ""its"" presence as a swirling, shadowy orb. I remember that he said he felt as if though it was waiting to be invited inside.

That wasn't the first time ""it"" had made an appearance. It had a short history of essentially disguising itself as me (mostly by using my voice) around him, and at least from my own research into demonology that's never exactly a good sign.

That week was something of a ride. I think I remember only once or twice when AJ said that he could feel something, and I don't remember myself experiencing anything until it was closer to the end of the week. But Jasper was seeing the shadow fairly often, feeling chills, and feeling angry at completely random times.

By the end of the week, we noticed that, out of all the places, the garage seemed to be the most attractive to things that were paranormal. We decided to take a camera one night, sit in the garage, and essentially do an amateur's version of a paranormal investigation. If I'm being honest, I don't think I expected much, if anything, to happen.

We sat down at a table. I remember that AJ cast a circle around us, sprinkled salt, and told us that we were not to move outside of the circle until he removed it. I also remember that Jasper was being a bit of a douche and did, in fact, move outside of the circle once or twice.

We were sure to be as quiet as possible between questions. We asked things like ""What is your name?"" ""What are you?"" ""What do you want?""

I want to be clear here and say that we didn't catch ANYTHING, and I honestly believe that that thing was doing whatever it could to ensure that we didn't get any ""proof.""

There were times when the camera would randomly go black, and then after a few moments the vision would come back on. It never, ever did anything like that prior to our visit to the garage, and it didn't do anything like that afterwards, either. I remember feeling so cold the entire time, and especially around Jasper's area. I remember hearing loud bangs and knocks that would sometimes come from corners, and other times come from outside of the garage [that said, we weren't able to tell if something mundane was causing it or not, which, though I consider that to be really possible, I also want to note that we never heard any sounds quite like that before or after that ""investigation""]. There was one point where he pointed to an area that was between he and I and told us that it was there. I snapped around about seven or eight pictures of that area, but later on, when I went to look at the pictures, ALL of them had malfunctioned to where there appeared to be nothing but green lines. Once again, my camera NEVER did that before or after that point.

[I don't know a great deal about electronics, and don't know anything about how certain fields can mess with images / audio / video, but I've heard that this is possible. If you do know something about it, please feel free to comment! I will say that even going back to that garage, and snapping pictures in the same spot with the same camera, I still didn't get the same result.]

Once we were thoroughly freaked out, we decided to go back to the main house and try to go to bed. AJ closed the circle, and perhaps it was just my imagination, but as soon as he did I felt about three times as uneasy. We all joined hands and hurried back to the room. Jasper, who was always the most sensitive to that thing, said that he could feel it behind us--said that he could even hear it WALKING behind us. I know that I didn't hear anything, so I can't attest to that. It might have been his imagination, or he might have really been hearing it.

I don't remember anything happening that week after that, aside from perhaps creepy dreams.

The day after I left for home, Jasper told me that he chunked the stone into a neighbor's yard. He said that he felt a bit better afterwards, but within a few days the thing returned. So did the stone. As in, it was back to the exact same place it was before he threw it, as if he had never even moved it.

When he told me that I was very skeptical--but A.J., who is very possibly the most honest person I have ever even heard of, swore up and down that he seen Jasper get rid of it, and that Jasper would have had NO way of going out to get it between the times of when it was ""gone"" and the time when they re-discovered it."
"Black Shadow With White Glowing Eyes","New Jersey","Shadow People","On Wednesday 24, 2018, it was like any other night for me. I was on my laptop writing a heartbreak story and I was also on my phone texting some of my friends. My room had no lights on, so it was really dark. At six pm I looked up from my laptop for some odd reason, and saw a black shadow with white glowing eyes looking at me from the end of my bed. I quickly grabbed my phone and turn on my flashlight. When I turn on my flashlight nothing was there. I checked out what can cause the white glowing eyes. I was thinking maybe the lights outside, because my bed is across from my window, but no cars were going by, no houses had lights on, and there were no street lights on.

 After trying to debunk the white glowing eyes I went back doing what I was doing. For a while I didn't see the shadow, but at six-thirty pm I saw the black shadow with white glowing eyes looking at me again. This time he was right near my laptop, [my laptop was right near my feet was and I was in the middle of my bed] I took out my phone really quickly and put my flashlight on again. When I turn on my flashlight the second time nothing was there again. I usually don't get scared, but he scared me for some odd reason. 

 After I put on my flashlight the second time, I got up and turned on the lights in my room. I researched to see what the heck I saw, there was three stories on what I saw. The first story, a girl saw two black shadows with white eyes standing right in her doorway in her room, she was walking up the stairs when she saw them. Later on she went back up the stairs, her little brother was in her room, so she went in another room. She didn't see anything, but then the black shadow with white eyes popped up from the chair in the corner of the room, and in the second story another girl saw 1 black shadow with white eyes and horns in her room at the end of her bed, and the third story ANOTHER girl saw a black shadow with white eyes, but she woke up out of breath two times and after the second time she saw the black shadow at the end of her bed, he turn around and that's when she saw his white eyes. 

All the story's have three things in common. The first thing in common is the girls were teenagers at the time and I am a teenager now, the second thing in common is we all saw a black shadow with white eyes, even though the black shadow I saw had white glowing eyes, it still had white eyes, and the third thing in common is that it happened in bed rooms.

 If you have any clue on what the heck I saw that night please comment on this and tell me, so I know what I am dealing with. Thank you and have a goodnight, good morning, or afternoon."
"I Think My House Is Haunted, I Don't Know What To Do Anymore Update","Arizona","Haunted Places","So to start off, thank you so much for everyone who replied to my last post. It honestly was extremely helpful.

After I read all the comments I went to my father and asked him about everything you guys said. He helped me pray over my room -etc-

For a while things started to calm down, I wasn't uneasy all of the time anymore and I could actually sleep without something waking me up but...

Some strange things are happening again, I'll give a little background before I go into it.

I have depression and anxiety so I'll go on a walk with my dog (yellow lab) every night and almost every morning to help my mood. Usually around 11pm and 4am. Nothing strange has ever happened. I'm always calm and not frightened at all. (I also live on farm land so basically all my neighbors have chickens or horses.) 

But about two or three days ago I went at around 2:30 AM because I couldn't sleep. When I did, I was about half way down my road when all of a sudden my dog went crazy, she was barking at something in the middle of the street whilst I couldn't see anything but the road ahead of me. She has never gone crazy like that unless there are other dogs out. 

After that, I decided to just head home. When I turned around and started walking, the horses my neighbors owned started going crazy as well, I looked back and checked on them.

They weren't there.

 Once again, I start heading home when I turned around the neighbors dogs started barking and howling. But, not at me. They were all at the other side of the fence as if something was with them?

When I got home I just sat at my desk playing video games as per usual, I left my door cracked open this time though. It was about an hour later when all of a sudden I feel this extreme weight on my chest? I guess that's the right way to put it, but it got hard to breath. I looked over at my door and it was just complete darkness... When just a moment ago the hallway light was on... I stood up, went to my door and once I did, there was no weight on my chest and I could see the hallway light again. 

Ever since that night, my dog has not left my side. She comes with me everywhere.

Yesterday I went into the kitchen to get some food (it was around midnight or 1AM) my dog was asleep so she didn't come to the kitchen until I made noise, when she walked down the hall and got into the living room, she wouldn't stop growling. I walked in there and once I did she turned to me and stopped growling.

Do you guys have any advice on this? 

Because honestly I don't know if I'm just being paranoid or something is actually there.

I have one more thing before I end this.

About two weeks ago, I was in a call with some friends playing video games (etc) and I randomly just hear this breathing and the right side of my neck got hot like someone was breathing on it.

I also always have a fan on me because of my rooms messed up air conditioning but, every time I'm at my desk, I'll just feel the air stop pointing at me but not like the fan moved or stopped working, it didn't. It was like something was standing in front of it. And once again as soon as I stood up it worked again.

The breathing that I mentioned in my previous post also has gotten worse. I'll wake up to someone just breathing right next to me or I'll be watching a video and I'll hear an extremely loud breathing in my ear.

Okay, sorry this one is so long but, I tried to make it detailed this time.

Thank you"
"Great Aunts' House And Other Ghosts","Mississippi","Haunted Places","I grew up visiting great aunts whose brother died in the house. His room would stay ice cold no matter how hot the rest of the house was, and they kept this house sweltering hot all year round! This is the house where cabinet doors that were stuck came swinging open at me. That was my 1st encounter with other the supernatural and it scared the living $@@$ out of me! I was 13 or so at the time and I'm now 43 so I've learned a lot since then. 

When my grandmother died she visited me and I literally walked her to Heaven's gates. My dad up until he died never believed me. My mom on the other hand did. She saw the same things I did in my great aunts' house. They were her aunts. 

When I had open heart surgery 3 1/2 years ago (after my dad died) I heard his voice tell me everything was going to be ok. I was wide awake. People have tried to tell me I was asleep and dreaming. No. I wasn't. I was awake as I am right now. 

I have had someone sit on the side of my bed several times since then. The house I live in now has had 3 people, that I know of, die in it. One was like a grandmother to me and one was my godfather. It is either when awake or it wakes me up and you can literally see an indentation where someone has sat down. My dog and cat also look into corners for minutes on end, when nothing is there. Animals can sense spirits before we can. My dog has barked at things not there. 

My godmother who lives in the other half of the house, I live in, and I heard just a couple of days ago what sounded like my husband call my name 3 or 4 times. H is gravely ill so I went running to make sure he was ok. He had been asleep and did not call me. Less than a week before that I felt someone playing with my hair then gently tug on it several times as I was as trying to go to sleep. Again I asked my husband what he was doing. He had his back to me sawing logs! Again, he was asleep. 

I have been to Old Salem outside of Senatobia, MS several time. I have a friend who will never go back there with me due to what we felt and saw. The 1st time I went by myself and thought maybe it was just my mind playing tricks on me since I had heard the stories of it being haunted. 

Then I took my mom (now remember all of my trips were in the 90s before everyone had cell phones lol!) and yes, my mom knows I went and has had many haunted experiences growing up. If anyone is a believer it's HER. She also saw shadow figures and ghosts walking around the graveyard. 

When I took two friends one being the guy who won't go back we all 3 felt cold spots on a hot humid southern night, again saw a shadow figure and he was in the back seat and his sister was in the front seat and I was driving. His sister and I at the same time felt hands start at the top of our heads and go down our necks to our shoulders (my left her right) to which we both accused her brother in the back seat which he could not have reached both of us at the same time sitting directly behind me. I had an old boat of a car not a small one where he could have reached both of us.

I have been back a couple of more times but not recently. The old church which became a Satanic worshippers spot has since been torn down but it is still at hot bed of paranormal activity. Anyone want to go back with me? And this time armed with cell phones and cameras.

I am awaiting my next visit!"
"Battle At Greasy Grass Aka Little Big Horn","Montana","Haunted Places","I was traveling to Billings, Montana from the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, to catch a flight. I had been camping and hiking solo for 3 weeks at this point and didn't realize I was going to drive past the Battle of the Greasy Grass, otherwise known as the Battle of Little Big Horn. 

It was just over an hour before the gates closed and I didn't need to be in Billings until the next evening, so I decided to stop in before looking for a campground closer to Billings. I walked around the graveyard and thought, ""wow, this is it."" I then went to the visitors center and was told I could drive down a long road to view the places where battles happened and that there would markers where native people and calvary men were buried. 

I still had about 45 minutes so I took off in my rental to the first overlook. As I walked up, I had my head down looking at the ground, stepped up off of the curb and onto the overlook before looking out onto the beautiful rolling hills. But what I see is a battle happening right in front of me. 

Native people on foot, calvary on horseback and on foot. Both had guns but natives also had bows. It startled me and I shook my head, similar to a wet dog, and it all disappeared. I thought whoa what the heck was that, but then just forgot about it as I checked out the markers and looked out over the hills. I've come to realize that things happen to me and I don't take it all too seriously. 

I got back in the rental to go to the next overlook. I had my head down until I reached the overlook and I saw another battle happening, not the same as the first, and then it just dissipated in a matter of a minute or so. I had time to go to one more overlook before they closed the gates and the same thing happened. 

So I'm really intrigued now and find a place to camp nearby so that I can return.

I waiting at the gates before they opened. I continued to go to all of the 12 overlooks and saw different battles at each one. 

I still had a little time before I needed to head to Billings so I decided to walk the little nature trail behind the visitor center. 

I love to photograph snakes (especially rattlers) and wildflower, among other creatures in our natural world. So I take the walk looking for rattlers and photographing wildflowers. 

As I walk down the path, it was as if I hit a brick wall that was not there. I could not walk further and I thought, ""there are dead people everywhere."" But then I looked around and did not see any markers so I said to myself that I was just being foolish and then continued the walk. 

When I got to the end of the trail there was a kiosk that said that the deadliest of all battles was fought here and there are bodies everywhere. Because of the terrain they were not excavated. 

I have not had an opportunity to return but I would like to one day to see if this happens again and take better note of the battles. 

I often have experiences on native land and spoke to an elder about this who said that I am supposed to share these experiences about native people to kind of close a gap of understanding between natives and others. This occurred in 2007."
"His Face Was Stretched","New Jersey","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","This particular incident requires a little family back story, so please stay with me and my apologies for any missing details. 

My mother's family suffered a great loss during the civil war in El Salvador. Many have heard of the death squads that targeted civilians. My grandfather was a victim. It's hard to talk about with my mom or her siblings. And asking my grandmother is a no-no - I would never bring myself to ask her; I doubt any of cousins would dare to either. From what I have been able to piece together it seems that somehow one of these squads thought my grandfather had been passing information to the Salvadoran government/military. One night they banged on the front door of the family home, demanded he come out, accused him of passing information, and murdered him in front of the whole family. My mother and her siblings were all various ages (toddler to teenager). This is the one defining event for my mother's side of the family, and none have ever sought out any kind of counseling for what they saw and experienced. All the siblings have a portrait of my grandfather in their homes and a necklace with a pendant of his picture. My mom has his picture in her bedroom - it is something I've seen my whole life and my now wife has seen since we started dating. 

I believe it was summer of 2005 or 2006. My parents bought a house in Elizabeth, NJ. A two family home with 4 floors. At the time a family of three was renting the first floor. The 2nd floor had our bathroom, living room, kitchen, and my mother's room. There was a narrow staircase in my mom's room that led to the attic where my room and my sister's room were located. 

It must have been passed 11pm on a Saturday night when my now wife and I got home. My sister and mother were out Lord knows where. My dad was working the graveyard shift at his factory job that weekend. The family on the first floor had already turned in for the night. My now wife hit the restroom first and then it was my turn. 

I was brushing my teeth when she came back to the bathroom. She was shaking bad and she was scared real bad. I asked her what was wrong and she said that she saw someone at the top of the stairs when she was going up to my bedroom. I rinsed my mouth out and went to the staircase to take a look myself. She was right behind me clinging to my shoulder, still visibly shaken. There was nothing to see when I got there. I asked her to describe who she saw and even now, 10+ years later, it gives me the chills and a bad case of goosebumps. She said that the male at the top of the stairs had a white elongated face with black eyes. And then she hit me with a bombshell - she said it looked like the man in the framed portrait by my mom's bed. It looked like my long deceased Abuelito Abraham. 

We didn't see or hear anything else that night, but I was uneasy. There was a lot of emotional turmoil those days and there were a lot more experiences at that house. I never told my mother what we saw - I didn't think and still don't think it would be wise."
"Grandma Visiting Me In My Dreams","California","Family / Friends Visits","This is my first time publishing one of my stories on here although I've always been a fan of reading stories on this website for years. I'm going to try to explain everything as much as possible.

 So back in 2006 my family and I lost our grandma. It was extremely difficult for me because I had grown up with her and we shared a room together so that way I can make sure she was still breathing during the night as she was only able to breathe through her oxygen tank. When she passed I was only 8 years old and at the time I didn't know what death was but somehow I knew that she was gone.

Fast forward when I turned 15. I had never had any dreams of my grandma until then. One night in my dream, I had received a phone call and when I answered, it was a woman whose voice I didn't recognize. When I asked who it was, all it said was ""don't tell me you forgot about me already?"" and in that instant I knew it was her. I woke up in tears as I had been crying in my dream. The next day I told my mom what happened and she couldn't help but cry and said maybe she felt like I forgot her (which couldn't possibly happen.) 

After a few years I had another dream which I don't clearly remember but all I can recall is that she walked into the room and I couldn't believe it was her. I was crying with my head on her lap while she was caressing my hair and I was telling her that I missed her.

Now let's fast forward to this year on the night before my 20th birthday. I dreamt that I was inside a room with my mom and apparently it was my grandma's room with her things inside. I was a little sad because I knew she was gone. While on the bed, I looked over my shoulder and saw my grandma was laying down next to me. I was so in shock that I burst into tears and she smiled at me. I was hugging her and telling her that I missed her everyday. I felt so at peace with her there. And just like that I woke up. I noticed every time I woke up I felt so much sadness in my heart. 

The next day while my boyfriend and I were driving to my parent's house for my birthday dinner, I explained my dream to him and he said ""Babe, your grandma came to visit you on your birthday."" I hadn't thought about that until then which gave me the chills and made me get so teary eyed. I genuinely believe my grandma came to visit me that night and perhaps even thinks that I forgot about her. Thank you for reading."
"Being Harassed By Hyperdemensional Enitties/ Spirit Attach","North Carolina","A Haunted Life","My name is Jonte and I really need help with a situation I am dealing with. I have been getting harassed and interfered with by negative entities going on 8 years and no one can seem to help.

 It all started about 8 years ago in Washington State when I started to notice everything started going wrong in my life all of a sudden. Friends that I grew up with started to betray me, girlfriends would break up with me for no apparent reason and a slew of back luck to follow.

 Every time I reach out to someone they always say have you ever played with a Ouija board, or have you ever been involved in the occult, or have you been involved in any new age materiel and the answer is always no.

 To be honest it all started when I started to seek the truth and ask questions about my very existence and why am I here. I have always felt like there was more to life that meets the eye and I wanted answers. As I started to ask theses questions and do my research I had what most people would call a spiritual awakening. Now I have been dealing with these entities that seem to follow no matter where I go and they are constantly attaching to me. 

The creepy part about it is I can actually feel the entities enter through my ears, and they also latch onto my legs and lower back. They make noises wherever I am at and harass me 24/7 and ruin any type of relationship I try to have. They also make knocking noises around my residence, thumping noises, banging noises and loud noises in my freezer in my kitchen.

 I get helicopters and airplanes constantly flying over wherever I am at and I swear you can't make this stuff up. Deep down I knew I wasn't the only one experiencing this so I decided to do some more research and I came across people that were calling themselves ""Targeted Individuals"" and they said they were getting ""Gang-Stalked"" and you can even google it.

 While my experiences where similar to theirs in every way, my perception of what was going on was different. I confirmed that when I came across another article which I will share here: http://in2worlds.net/gangstalking-and-targeted-individuals

 It seemed like I finally found out what was happening to me but I can not find a solution to stop it after I have tried so many things. So I am here hoping someone has experienced something like this and found a solution to the problem and that's why I am here thanks..."
"Evil In The Corner","Mississippi","Haunted Places","My childhood best friend had a great deal of paranormal activity around him--and when I say that, he was (perhaps both unintentionally AND purposely, at times) inviting extremely dark, extremely negative energies into his personal space, and I've chosen to not relay the majority of the stories that happened essentially solely to him, for a few different reasons (including the fact that I wasn't there, can't remember all of the things that happened in the order that they did, etc). But I will tell this one!

This took place a few years ago. It was late at night, and he and I were walking around his yard. He lived on the outskirts of a forest, where sometimes you could see, hear, or sense ""things."" On this particular night of wandering the yard, we heard such a strange sound. It was almost like a gathering of some sort, with someone talking into a microphone, but everything said was so garbled. It was loud, yet you couldn't make out a word. At first we assumed it was coming from further down town and decided to walk in that direction, but after a few minutes the location of the source of the noise would change. In other words, if it had been behind us before, it was now in front of us; if it had been northwest, and we turned to face the northwest, it would suddenly switch to the south. If we turned to face the south, it would be in the east. (LET ME BE CLEAR: when I am saying this it was NOT that the noise was coming from all around us and ""mostly"" in one direction--it was more like it was coming from ONLY that direction, but would change location completely as soon as we tried to go to where it was.) 

It happened a few different times before he and I decided to go back in. Once we were inside we could no longer hear the noise--even though the walls were thin, and if we had been outside, standing right next to the trailer, we would have been hearing it. His brother and sister-in-law, who he lived with, hadn't heard anything when we asked them.

Nothing else happened the weekend I was there that I can remember, but something DID happen when I arrived back home Sunday evening.

I remember sitting at my computer, reading about a non-related topic, when I felt this awful, black energy the opposite side of my room. I can't explain it other than to say that my room suddenly had a HORRIBLE energy, but it wasn't the room itself, nor was I ""just creeped out""--it was specifically emanating from that corner. I was too scared to even move from the computer and would try to glance over with my peripherals, but saw nothing - Just FELT it. I lasted perhaps thirty minutes with that terror, but by then I was exhausted, frustrated, so I stood up, straightened my back, and said, ""You need to leave immediately. Leave my room, leave my home. Don't linger in this area. Never return.""

At that age I was pretty shy with everyone, but I said it so firmly that I could barely even believe I was the one who said it. And as soon as I had, I FELT it leave... Almost slowly, but not quite. After a minute or so, the room felt completely normal. I never felt anything quite like that again.

As I said before, that friend had been dealing with a lot of negative energies, and is quite possibly still dealing with them. I fully believe that that thing that was in my room that night followed me home--that it was perhaps the same thing that had been tormenting him, or was perhaps another entity that wanted to see if I would ""go along"" with it.

I've dealt with other paranormal events, but this is honestly probably one of the scariest for me, if not the scariest, solely because of how EVIL that thing felt. And I am honestly so happy to be a part of a website that allows people to convey their experiences in this way."
"Grandma Visits While In A Coma 10 Miles Away","Texas","Family / Friends Visits","I was 5 or 6 years old. I woke up one night hearing voices in the room and it woke me up. I looked over and it was my sister and grandma talking. I got up and asked what they were still doing awake.

Grandma asked if mom had done laundry because she needed her shawl. Mom had brought it home to wash because she said it was dirty. I told them I would go check. I went to the back porch to the washing machine and checked the basket on top.

I went back in house and told them both it was still dirty. I asked why she needed it she said that she was going on a long journey and she needed it. 

Grandma told both my sister and I things that would happen to my sister. She would have a hard life and the Drs would tell her that she wouldn't be able to have kids, but my grandma would make sure that she had 1 boy and 1 girl. In that order. She told her not the worry. And she would watch out for both of us.

 She said she ran out of time and needed to go but she would be back in a couple of days to get her shawl. And to make sure mom washed it. 

So the next day I remember telling mom that she needed to wash grandma's shawl. But she was too busy that day. The next day it rained all day long. The third day it was humid but dry. No rain. So mom washed laundry all morning. By lunch time she was done. By 4:00 that afternoon it starting raining big fat drops of rain. Everybody raced outside to get all the laundry before it got wet. We folded it and put it away. 

That night I heard voices again. It was grandma and my sister whispering to each other. I got up and asked what they were whispering about and my sister said it was between her and grandma. Then she asked me if I would go get grandma's shawl. So I did. 

When I came back grandma said she had to talk to both of us about some things. She said that she was going on a very long journey and that was why she needed her shawl. Mom and dad would be sad but it wouldn't be for very long.

Things would be hard but it would all work out in the end the way it was supposed to. 

Then she looked at me and said that I would be handful but she would take care of me and make sure that nothing bad happened to me. 

I asked where she was going and she said she was going a long trip. When she was leaving I walked outside on the porch with her and asked her again where she was going. 

She said that she had make some bad decisions in her life and she had to pay for those decisions. She said see those stairs? And I said yes. I have to follow them to that far away star that is way over there. When I get there, my penance will be paid and I can be in peace. 

I asked if I could go with her to keep her company and she said no, I had to stay here to keep mom happy.

 I then said who's going to keep you company Grandma? You're going to be lonely on your journey. And she told me that was the way it needed to be. 

 She kissed me and I watched her climb the stairs until I couldn't see her no more. I went back inside and went to bed. 

The next morning I heard the phone ring. Mom answered, then called my dad to the phone. I heard crying and then I heard my sister and mom and dad talking. It woke me up so I got out of bed and asked what was going on. 

My sister said to tell mom and dad that grandma had picked up her shawl last night and she wasn't lying. I told them she did and they looked at each other and then my mom said never to tell anyone because they wouldn't believe us. 

Come to find out years later grandma had been in a care home 10 miles away. She had been in a coma the 3 days before she passed away. So her talking to us and picking up her shawl is quite a feat for a spirit to do. But it happened."
"An Unsettling Visit","Georgia","Haunted Places","A few years ago I experienced an isolated strange occurrence in the middle of the night. I will preface the telling of this event by stating that I don't normally have nightmares, night terrors, or trouble sleeping. I have lived in my house for 19 years with nothing overtly scary or paranormal happening before or after this occurrence. We were not the first owners of the house but it was built in the 1980's and nothing (to my knowledge) horrible occurred in it. 

I don't remember the exact time of year this happened, but I do remember that it was a warm season, possibly spring or summer, when I awoke suddenly from a deep sleep and felt an extreme sense of fear. I don't scare easily but this was an absolutely terrifying feeling. I remember scanning the room for a source of the fear and not seeing anything. There was no stranger, no child, nothing. When I looked towards the area of my room that contained a small hallway that led to the closet and the bathroom area, I felt more afraid. The source of my fear was very definitely coming from that area. It was almost palpable. 

I also realized that it was freezing cold in my room. I remember thinking that it should not have been that cold. It was spring or summer and it only feels that cold when it is winter. We also keep our thermostat on 72 and it was definitely colder than that. I know that I was awake because even though I was scared, I was rational enough to try to figure out what was happening. My husband was asleep next to me and my dog was curled up at my feet and asleep. I was able to move, so I know it wasn't sleep paralysis. 

As I lay there trying to decide what to do, my dog raised his head, looked at the bathroom/hallway/closet area, and let out the deepest, slowest, most ominous growl I have ever heard issue from him. He has not done that before or after, we've had him for 7 years now. I had not moved my position in the bed to indicate that I was awake, only my eyeballs (haha). Sort of like a deer being spotted by a predator, I intentionally kept very still until I could locate the threat.

After a few moments my dog lay his head back down and I hid under the covers saying the Lord's Prayer until I fell back asleep. I am religious but not devoutly so, and don't normally resort to frequent bouts of praying. 

I still have not figured out what happened, but my dog validated that there was something there. I've had no more experiences. The extreme fear, the unsettling cold, and my dog's reaction suggest something unnatural. Or could the dog detect my fear and that was what caused him to growl? What then would explain the cold temperature? I do recall the coldness fading before I fell back asleep. 

I hope to never experience it again, whatever it was. I do know that it was not friendly. To this day, I ALWAYS turn on the light in the hallway area before passing through it."
"Ghost Playing A Trick On My Grandfather?","New Hampshire","Haunted Places","So I didn't actually expieirence this haunting event, but my grandfather sure did! (I will try my best to describe what I heard from my grandfather.) 

It is around 30 or more years ago and a sweet old man dies of a heart attack at his home. (My uncle was actually the one to find his body and report it to the police.) 

 (Fast forward some years) 

My grandmother's parents buy the house that that sweet old man lived in, and they hire my grandfather to renovate/work on their house and get it ready for them to move in.

One night, my grandfather is waiting for his friend (let's say his friends name is Brad, because I don't remember his real name) to come and help him work on the house.

All of the sudden, my grandfather hears loud footsteps in front porch of the house. (Being a very humorous man, my grandfather plays tricks on his friends all the time) So, my grandfather thought his friend Brad was playing a trick on him. ""I know that's you, Brad!"" My grandfather shouts. There is no response, so my grandfather walks over to the front porch and opens the door. Right as he opens the door, a HUGE rush of coldness rushes through him, and all the hairs on his arms stand up. My grandfather quickly closed the door, packed up his tools, and went home!

 (Later that night) 

My grandfather is cutting wood in his basement (at his own home) when my grandmother comes downstairs. ""Honey, are you alright?"" She asks. ""Your face is so white, it looks like you've seen a ghost!""

Yes, it could have been the sweet old man's ghost playing a trick on my grandfather. But I'm not sure! Any ideas? Comment!

"Demon Spirit Possession. Advice Greatly Appreciated","Texas","Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms","I do not know how to help my friend whom I now believe is possessed by an evil demon. She has symptoms that have led me to recognize this in her. She now exhibits violent, confrontational anger the drop of a hat, (all of what I describe is new behavior) she is constantly physically busy,working,doing chores, never still... It is pathological. She is accusing, suspicious, insulting and foul mouthed. She changes at the drop of a hat. How can I help her?

 She realizes something is wrong and that she has changed. So telling her what I think is wrong with her will not be out of left field for her. She says she believes in God, and I know this to be true. But she does not remotely act like it any more. So what can be done? Is there anything I can do, as far as casting this out of her? I want to help her, but she needs the right help. Her anger infects people and they start taking on her aspects of anger, reactionary accusations and suspicions.

 She does possess the classic symptoms of what would be considered spirit possession. She almost lost her life in a car accident last night. I don't want her to die with this kind of thing attached to her. What can be done? Can one person cast this thing out of her? I know it takes some specific steps to help those afflicted with such a thing. My poor friend is suffering and alienating everyone in her life by her radical hateful behavior. People not savvy to the spirit realm think she is crazy, and do not recognize the spiritual sickness. Her home feels heavy. Other friends have mentioned this, and I agree. She is physically violent, feels sick, nauseated all the time, and blames everyone for her bad outcomes or problems. Having known her for about a decade, I know the real her. She was never like what I see now.

 She was attacked in her home by a friend who is schizophrenic. He told her during his violent assault that he was there to 'fix ' her and proceeded to beat her to a pulp and we believe he was going to beat her to death if the assault had not been interrupted.

 I had a precognition about this assault about 6 weeks before it happened. It was overwhelming. I told her that this particular person was going to try and kill her and to stay away from him. She did not take my counsel, and felt she could handle his schizophrenic episodes. What I foresaw was not like that. She would not be able to handle what he would do to her, as he laid in wait outside her house and attacked her when she arrived home in the foyer of her house. Please, advice would be greatly appreciated and carefully considered. I don't want to forsake my friend and leave her in her misery. Thank you for your response. Sincerely, Eyeswim"
"Weird Summer","New York","Family / Friends Visits","I couldn't think of a title so I used this one which does fit:D. 

On Friday July 13th I had major back surgery. My back had to be reconstructed. I am now fused from T-8 all the way down to my Sacral area. 

The surgery took about 9 hours with 2 surgeons. Problem was they couldn't wake me up in recovery which was a concern for the Doctors,Nurses,and my family.

 As for me I was in total darkness for I don't know how long. I mean I don't feel like I'm in my body and I'm wearing normal clothes. Nothing but darkness, time standing still. Suddenly I hear familiar voices, of people who have died. My grandparents are telling me it's okay if I want to let go and come home to them. They say I have been through enough and I need the rest. My father in-law joins in saying the same. I make my decision they are right, I knew going in that I could die. I start feeling lighter and floating but something is stopping me, I feel like I am anchored. I start to panic a little and start to pull at whatever is anchoring me. I gave one more pull and all of a sudden I'm in pain back in my body still trying to pull away. I open my eyes and my best friend had been at the hospital for most of my surgery with my daughter and my husband who works at the hospital. My best friend was the anchor, she had my hand in both of hers and she is praying holding my hand to her heart. I was awake for only a little while but I found out that the nurses had been trying to wake me up for 3 hours and I have to stay in recovery overnight because of my vitals. 

They got me up for a short walk on Sunday and sat me in a chair when we got back to my room. I had my left leg over my right and I feel a dog nose on my toe and when I looked I saw an outline of a small fuzzy dog. Many years before they had a dog lab in the infancy of heart surgery to learn procedures. Which made no sense to me when I found out because a dog anatomy is nowhere near that of a human but I guess a heart is a heart (I was at St. Francis Hospital a top Heart Hospital). Then a few seconds later I felt a tap on my head like hey sit straight. Right after that my nurse came in to see how I am and I tell her I want to go back to bed.

I had told the nurse and nurse companions about a problem I had with an air bed like mine in another hospital years ago, it had broken. Thursday night after a long walk with the physical therapist I get back to my room and my bed is broken so they had to get me another bed! 

The next day I was discharged and was glad to be home. My son Eric (WhiteWolf) has been an incredible help. He took the N.Y. State Trooper test last year and scored an 89 and made the list of candidates. I am so proud of him. 

A couple of weeks later I was very sleepy after my alarm. My daughter didn't like the way I was sitting in the dining room chair so she told me go sit in the recliner in my sleepy state. I told her to F off because in reality she could try the patience of a Saint. I started sleep walking a little while later and was at the kitchen sink waking up trying to figure out why I can't walk and I see what looked like a disembodied fist and forearm and I feel like I got punched in the heart. The hit was so hard it knocked me off my feet and I fell flat on my back knocking the wind out of me. I tried yelling for help but it came out little more than a whisper so I rolled onto my side until I could get the strength to get up myself which took awhile. I finally got up and got Eric, my heart felt funny but I've had anxiety attacks because of my daughter before so as long as I wasn't altered we just put it down to that. Some things would vanish then return after I said put it back. 

I think the strangest thing of all is the dogs. We kept both parents and 3 of their puppies weight range from 88 pounds (the father a normal Malamute) to 131 pounds (the mother a M'Loot Malamute a.k.a. A giant Malamute). All of the dogs have been as careful with me as they can but will be rough with others."
"In My Bed","Ohio","Shadow People","I'm a female and the youngest out of me and my brother. I have lived in the same house for about 18 years now. I would like to say that I'm a pretty religious person, I go to church and even go to a Catholic school. But I'm not the kind to shove my religion or beliefs down your throat. So naturally I believe in the paranormal and the supernatural. 

I was about 12-13 years old when my first paranormal occurrence happened. I have always had a messy room and you know what they says""cleanliness is next to Godliness."" Well I was the opposite and had a messy room all the time. Finally something clicked in me that I didn't want a dirty room anymore. So I cleaned my room top to bottom. I threw things out I swept I even rearranged my room. My room is a medium size room. In a square like shape. From the door off to the left is where I originally had my bed. I moved it clear across my room to have it in a completely different spot. So now it was right across from my door and I always slept with my door open to the hallway light would come into my room.

So later that night when I went to bed the hallway light would shine into my room making it hard for me to sleep. Finally I was able to fall asleep with the light shining in my face. Well I always had a thing when I was little that I would wake up in the middle of the night to change my position. I always slept on my stomach or my sides. 

Like every other night I woke up to switch from my stomach to my side. Well when I turned around to lay on my side in the darkness I saw this thing. Now I don't know if you guys have ever read the childhood scary book series called Scary Stories to tell in the dark. Well in the first edition there is a small song called the slithery dee (might have spelt wrong). Well in this song page there on the bottom is a creature with a head too big for its body, completely round and it's covered in hair or fur from head to toe. It had a tail and of course claws. Well the thing looked just like it besides it's legs. 

In the dark I could see it. It was darker than the night sky. It was looking right at me and it was crawling onto my bed to my legs. But I could tell that when I looked at it it was just as scared of me as I was to it. It froze and stared at me. I freaked out and like any other kid I jumped under my blankets and put a pillow over my head. I didn't feel the thing anymore nor did I hear it. I was debating on whether I scream for my dad or just go back to sleep. I choose to fall back asleep. I couldn't tell if it had left or if it was still on my bed, I couldn't feel it or hear it so as I waited for a half hour, I was in complete horror. 

I woke the next day to no clue if the thing was still there or if it was gone. But there was no place for it to hide. I had no underbed and no closet. The only thing I had was messy bedroom for things to hide in but my room was clean and my room stays clean so things like that can't hide. 

I don't know what it was and I know for a fact it was not a dream or a shadow. It was real! 

As I get older and learn more about things I try and connect it to something, so far all I can think of is that it was a shadow person. Was it there it hurt me? I doubt it. It wouldn't have froze when I looked at it. It would have jumped to the chance. Was it there just to watch me? I don't know. I don't know what it was there for."
"Disembodied Voices At Work","Mississippi","Haunted Places","FULL DISCLAIMER: While all of the spirit encounters I've had have been almost certainly paranormal and cannot be explained away, this is the only one that MIGHT have been partially created from my imagination--but I don't really believe that's the case, for reasons of which I'm about to explain.

A couple months after I started my last job at a gas station, I was left alone to close up the kitchen. After my manager left and I was about to start washing some dishes, I heard a child--perhaps a little girl?--laughing in the back room (which was right next to the kitchen). The store manager sometimes allowed her granddaughter to come in while she waited for said manager to get off, and I thought that's who it was, but when I went to look there was no one there. I chalked it up to imagination and put it in the back of my mind.

A few weeks later the assistant manager and I were talking and--according to him--there was a time where he and a friend of his were talking at work. He was working the night shift, and the two of them were the only ones in the building. Things had slowed down so they were cracking up. One of them made some joke and once they both stopped laughing they heard another, much deeper chuckle from the back area of the building. Both of them were creeped out and the manager went to investigate to see if anyone was there, checked the security footage, and so on. While he said that the laughter hadn't been picked up by the cameras, both he and his friend heard it clearly (and of course, this is assuming he was being honest).

A few more weeks pass, and my boyfriend had started working at the gas station as well. Without having ever been told about my story or the manager's, he came up to me a few hours before leaving and told me that he had heard a voice of an elderly woman chuckle and say, ""Mr. Paul."" When he turned around, no one was there. Keep in mind that he heard that crystal clear, EVEN THOUGH at the time one of his ears was blocked, and he was having trouble hearing me if I stood right beside him.

At that point I was really curious about what was going on and decided to bring my pendulum to work. I got there thirty minutes before I was scheduled to clock in and hid where I knew no one was likely to find me. I grounded myself and did the usual things one needs to do when they're using pendulums. If you're not familiar with them, I highly suggest you look into them. They're very interesting, very useful, and I can say I've yet to find that something my pendulum guided me to was wrong. When I asked if there was a spirit that was staying in or around the building, it swung ""yes."" When I asked if said spirit was the same that I and others had been hearing, it swung for yes again.

The next day or so I heard voices talking in the office (which was above the kitchen), but it struck me as strange because no one was supposed to be up there. When I went to investigate the noise had stopped and, of course, no one was there, but when I got back to the kitchen it sounded like there were people talking in the front counter area. I looked there, but there was only one person working for the front counter, and she said she hadn't had a customer in the past twenty or thirty minutes.

I've since quit the job, but I've been thinking about going back to the area to investigate. If I do, and if anything significant and / or noteworthy happens, I'll be sure to update this."
"Can A Painting Be Haunted? This Is Serious","Georgia","Haunted Items","Thankyou to everyone who read and liked my first story about my grandparents home. 

This story intails a painting that my mother brought home from a auction when I was about 8.

As I have stated previously my parents imported and exported antiques and fine wines for many years. Now just antiques. 

My mother Natasha is Russian born but grew up in the USA from the age 3, and always had the love of anything old and unusual when it came to furniture and artworks. Something that seems to have rubbed off on me a little. 

My parents would regularly go to auctions and estate sales and the like to purchase interesting pieces for their Business. It was rare that anything purchased at these sales ever made it home to become part of our house unless it was out of the ordinary or my parents liked it too much to part with it.

My childhood home looked like a cross between a mad man's idea of a yard sale and a antiques market belonging to an insane hoarder. But it made for good fun and interesting conversation. And many a good fort.

None of the furniture or artworks previous had bothered me as far as I can remember until my mother purchased a painting by an unknown artist (it's never been signed and research has never uncovered who painted it or who the subject actually is). All we know is that the family who put it in the auction bought the home they had found it in and didn't like the painting or several pieces of furniture that the last owners had left behind. So off to the sales they went. It was a rather large lot of over 50 items. My mother purchased the painting and a sideboard full of silverware and plates of varying ages locked inside (we got them open after we got it home. It was strange as my mother had been told it was empty. Not so much as it turned out.).

The painting is of a women of about 30 years old (maybe older but it's hard to tell) wearing a long blue-grey gown standing in a veranda of an old house. Next to her is a table with a tea set and kettle and what looks like some cake or sandwiches on a plate. There are some flowers and a chair and part of a window. Whoever did the painting had a lot of talent as the detail is incredible. It was probably painted around 1900-1910. Judging by the fashion she's wearing. 

My mother brought it home and we hung it in the hallway next to my parent's bedroom between the main bathroom and a little room my dad used to do his paperwork in. 

I felt very strange around the painting from the first day it was hanging up. The hallway in summer was comfortable and not too warm but after the painting was hung up the area around the painting turned almost ice cold. Passing the painting I'd get goose bumps on whatever exposed skin I had. 

I also started feeling like the lady in the painting was watching me. My twin sisters started saying that they didn't like looking at the painting as it made them feel uncomfortable and like they weren't meant to be around it. My baby brother would walk on the other side of the hallway to it. And when asked why he'd say he didn't like the lady and that he was cold when he looked at her (he was 5 at the time nearly 6).

Soon it went past just feelings in the hallway. At night we'd start hearing whispers that hadn't been there previous. Our house already had its share of spooky behaviour we had got used to but this was new. 

Movement of a flash of blue-grey like the dress out of the corner of your eye. A strange touch occasionally in the hallway when no one else was around. This may sound like something from Tales From the Crypt but I assure you this isn't something I saw on tv. I only wished sometimes it was.

After my father (6'5"", 350 pounds of him) got a cold hand run up his back when he was in the shower was any real notice of what we all had said to our parents. Used to other ghosts in the house we at first thought oh it's just another spirit making itself known to us as its new here.

But then things got bad. Fast.

- My baby brother (let's call him Adam) was tripped on the stairs and pushed by a cold hand when he tried to get up again.

- The big fern we had in the hall next to the painting suddenly started dying. It was over 20 years old and had no previous problems. When moved away from the painting it went back to being fine. It's still alive today but one side of it looks a little mangled (the side facing the painting never was the same. The branches grew back weird like something had infected them. It was checked out and tested by plant specialist and they couldn't find anything wrong with the old plant).

- Our dogs Frankie and Dex (both terrier mixes) wouldn't go past the painting without whining or growling at it. They were normally very placid and gentle dogs. Our aunt's dog Lula (a poodle) had to be carried past it when we used to babysit her she wouldn't walk past it or even look at it.

- Our cats tried to claw at it one time when it fell of its hook onto the ground. Our normally placid Maine coon cats Sally and Meg both went nuts trying to scratch it until we took it away. 

- It started coming off the hook every night and sat against the wall upright every morning when no one touched it.

My mother a very spiritual person who put up with our friendly spirits in the house with a grain of salt as they didn't bother her decided that this painting had to go and something was wrong with it. To which we all agreed.

So off to the auctions it went. Several times. My mother who knew the buyers found out they only kept it a month (they too heard whispers and their cat also attacked the painting) and gave it to a neighbour who liked it. The neighbour sold it on after her dog freaked out around it. 

It kept getting sold on or auctioned or given away until 2014 when a man who collected art in Florida bought the painting and did not know of its history. Having again tried to research it's past. He only found out it was possibly a painting of an artist's wife who died young. I don't know if it's true of not. There is no real record of the artwork anywhere and it's not signed. The man who owned it last I heard keeps it in his basement, as it frightened his grandchildren. He says he won't sell it on and keeps it locked up. I think too he knows something isn't right with it. I'm worried as he's old what's going to happen when he dies.

This painting I think isn't safe. Either a ghost is in it or attached to it and it's not friendly. So please anyone of you see this painting let me know, it really should be destroyed.

I know it probably sounds like a made up story for kids. And a adult man like myself shouldn't be weary of a old oil painting of someone Unknown. 

This painting is dangerous. Please destroy it if you buy it. It's really not worth the trouble.

I'm sorry it's a long story. I wasn't going to post it until I talked to Adam about the painting last night and it still scares him. And he loved exploring abandoned places and doesn't get frightened."
"Anne's House Update","Florida","Haunted Places","It's been a long time since I've posted anything here. There are few stories I haven't shared. I thought maybe keeping experiences to myself and putting less energy towards it would keep activity in my life down. That's been the case for a while... But since it's close to Halloween my coworker was intrigued by my stories and I feel as though since I've been talking about them with her I've been sensing something... But honestly maybe I'm just crazy!? 

It's been probably a year since my last experience. I don't know if I'm attracting it or what. It doesn't feel negative. I just don't know if I want to share about it yet. Is it possible that It's all in my head? I don't know unless I'm literally seeing things. Then I'm really crazy.

Anyways... If you haven't read my story about Anne's house, I recommend you do that so you can understand this update.

Anne is still in contact with my boyfriend's mom (Mandie) whom I have gotten closer to after falling pregnant and having her granddaughter. We now talk a lot and she was telling me about the crazy paragraph long text messages she gets from Anne (remember she is schizophrenic). I'd like to add Mandie had no idea what I experienced in that house, because at the time we weren't very close. Anne also didn't know what I saw, with her being so deranged I didn't want to add to her hallucinations and confuse her idea of reality even further. 

That all changed though, because in these text messages she was talking about her home, stating she sees someone looking in her window at night (from the back yard, which is where I saw this figure), and that sometimes there's something in her bedroom with her. She was saying how her home makes her feel so extremely depressed and uncomfortable, she never feels truly alone and always feels like she's being oppressed. It seems as though her hallucinations get worse from there, and in her stories she is always the victim of some insane scenario. 

Mandie was so surprised when I told her what I experienced, and apparently this isn't the first time Anne has said things like this (going back years), but she always just thought it was stemming from her disorder. 

Mandie has gone ghost hunting several times with some friends that are always looking for new places to investigate, so she asked Anne if that would be something she'd be interested in and she agreed to it.

 On the morning of the investigation she backed out. I think that maybe the idea of addressing this or making some sort of change was too much for her to accept. So I guess I'll never really get closure on this experience (which honestly impacted me greatly, being in this house was a very negative and depressing time in mine and my boyfriends life). I still think Anne draws this entity to her, she really doesn't do anything to help herself or bring any positive energy into the home. I still pray for her often.

Thank you for any comments!"
"Static Figure","Florida","Haunted Places","To begin I would like to include for about a year or so of my childhood I had a ""sleep walking"" issue. I was maybe 6 or so years old and fairly often I would wake up in completely random spots of our home, kitchen, living room and even a couple times in the same spot of our back yard.

 I have never been able to remember dreams that I've had my entire life so therefore I have left the possibility that this experience was a dream coming through. I remember this encounter very vividly over the years and I have never had anything like this happen since we left the house. But to finally get to it, one night I had a strange feeling cast over me and I went to my parents room to sleep with them because I was so scared.

 My father woke up very early to go to work about 4:30am I remember waking up before he left and saying goodbye, after he left I tried to go back to sleep but felt that same strange feeling again. My mom was still asleep and I was still in bed but I had a clear line of sight to the doorway, I broke through the fear and forced myself to open my eyes and when I did I saw a large figure approach the doorway but it wasn't a normal person, it had the shape of a man but the entire body was just a black and white static.

 I quickly closed my eyes and was frozen with fear, my eyes stayed closed maybe 30-45 seconds before I looked again and the shape was gone. After this I never saw this shape again but there were many in explained noises in the house including a banging on our guest bathroom door that even my parents heard but blamed on me since they were together and I was the only other one in the house.

 I would really appreciate some inputs here to see if there's any logical reasons for what I saw. About 14 years later and the memory of this still stresses me out trying to make some sense of it."
"An Uneasy Milk Request","Connecticut","Haunted Places","So I know the title is really weird, but it was the best I could come up with. This... Super freakish thing happened to me the other day and I'm actually afraid of my sister's house now because of it.

To preface, my sister had closed all the blinds and you couldn't see inside their living room. Her car was also in the driveway.

A few nights ago my mom and I were cooking dinner, and my mom asked me to walk next door to my sister's house and ask for a cup of milk. No one in my house drinks milk regularly, so we don't tend to have milk around. Anyways, I walked over and knocked on their front door. The dog started barking, and I heard someone inside talking. A woman was saying something about my nephew. I genuinely thought it was my sister. So I knocked again, the dog kept barking (from my sister's bedroom, on the other side of the house, despite that he had full reign of the house.) and I heard the woman talking some more.

I stood there and kept knocking for a solid 5-6 minutes, getting mad and starting to yell at her through the door. Finally, I gave up and walked around back of the house. I walked in through their back door because the knob is busted and it's always unlocked, and I went into the house. Only to find no one was home. I checked every room, even the creepy basement, and then I looked at my phone, she posted a picture on facebook at the time of the talking in her house, of her and my nephew out to dinner.

My sister did ask if her dog might've hit one of her son's toys, because obviously, a clean house and a toddler don't mix. But I distinctly heard the voice mentioning my nephew's name. My sister freaked out and started yelling when I told her, in her living room, yelling at my grandmother saying she was going to get the house exercised if she didn't cut it out. (Something we all laugh about now, because my sister is terrified of anything paranormal.) 

This is a some what unrelated note, but while I'm typing this, there's a shadow moving around in my parent's room, which is almost at an angle from mine, and I'm the only one home. (All three animals in the house are at the opposite end of the house right now.) I am just a little unnerved by the movement. Not sure how I should feel right now, since what I'm typing and what's happening are like... Maybe linked? Scary to think about."
"Visits From A Shadow","Mississippi","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","This took place in my parents home. But before I tell my story, I want you to know I never heard of a shadow person. I knew nothing about their existence, but that was about to change. 

In my childhood home we had a lot of unexplained things happen. Lights would cut on and off. The faucets would run. We heard walking in the hall. We heard voices. We saw little twinkly lights that would dance around in the dark. I heard growling and something calling my name.

My sister had moved in to my parents house with her two children. She was going through a divorce and needed a place to stay. There room was next to mine connected by a bathroom we shared. I had just woken up it was early morning. I remember like it was yesterday.

The sun was shining through the window. I could see everything. I could hear my mother and sister talking in the kitchen. They were talking about me. See I had just graduated from high school, and didn't have any plans for college.

I laid there listening to them. My mom said I was a screw up. But to be fair how was I to go to college without any money. My father made too much for financial aid. And they didn't have anything put back for me.

As I laid there Listening I started to cry. I must of fallen asleep. Next thing I noticed my bed started to shaking. I laid there for a minute thinking it was the washer shaking the house. But then it got to where the shaking was strong. 

I turned over and to my surprise there was a shadow in the shape of a human at the end of my bed. I didn't feel fearful. And then the shadow spoke all it said was hi Elizabeth. And then it was gone. I got up after that. But I couldn't comprehend what I just seen. 

I did some research and discover it was a shadow person. And I have seen it a few times since then. But the strange thing is, it has never scared me. And it has not spoken to me since."
"Supernatural Entity In My Home As A Child","California","Haunted Places","For privacy reasons I will not share the exact location this took place, but I will state it occurred in a newly built house in Southern California. I currently still live in this house. This event took place in the late 1990's.

 One night when I was about 8 years old, I was sleeping in my sister's room with her. She is 4 years younger then me and we sometimes slept in each other's bedrooms together as little kids. I remember waking up in the middle of the night and she was asleep. I didn't know if my mother and father were also asleep, but all the lights in the house were off, which was normal for that time of night. I wanted to know if my mom or dad were awake, so I stood on the bed I had been sleeping on, and looked through the open bedroom door through our hallway, and into the living room of our first story house. From the bed I could see the backdoor to our backyard, and part of our living room fireplace right of the backdoor. 

It was then I saw the supernatural entity. It appeared to be a humanoid figure in a white cloak. The entire figure was made of a bright white light that didn't seem to illuminate the room around it. It's face was hidden beneath the hood of the cloak. I couldn't tell if it seemed male or female. It looked slightly shorter then an average adult, and seemed thin. It held its hands together in front of itself and silently paced back and forth in front of our fireplace. After seeing it pace back and forth a few times, I was overcome with fear and tried to silently lay back down in bed and fall asleep, which I evidently did. 

The next morning I told my family about what I saw. I searched for any evidence of what happened the night before, but was unable to produce any. I don't know if any of my family believed me, but my mother said she thought it was scary that I saw something in our house when I told her the next morning.

 I haven't seen anything like this since that event. I never brought up the event with my family again, but I've occasionally thought about it throughout my life and tell the story sometimes to friends and coworkers when discussing the paranormal and supernatural. I wanted to post this story to document this event. Now as an adult, I still wonder what occurred that night so many years ago. I think it was some kind of spirit, maybe a ghost, but our house was brand new, and nobody had or has passed away in it yet. The land the house is built on was a field of chaparral before the neighborhood was built, and I don't know much else about the land unfortunately. I hope someday I will find a answer to what I saw."
"Ghosts And Dungeons","Oregon","Haunted Places","I have had many ghost experiences in my life and have always considered myself to be a very spiritual person. With that being said, I have always been extremely cautious when it comes to the supernatural. I won't even let a ouija board or tarot cards near me. I just don't like to mess with things because I know that I draw them in and have worked too hard on building an astral shield to let them in. However, that doesn't mean that I don't encounter some weird things. In my experience, I know that spirits are drawn to those who can feel them...

I began attending a pretty old college last year as a vocal music major. This meant that I had and still have to spend hours in the basement of the theater practicing my repertoire. Since I've always been into ghost stories I decided to do some research about my school and turns out, the theater is a hot spot for activity between the founder of the building and a little girl haunting the space. The founder of the building has been known to show up in practice rooms and offer instruction to those practicing which even I have a hard time believing. This sprit I do not fear, however, the little girl really alarms me. Usually, if there is no reason for a child to haunt a building, it is my understanding that this is a demon taking the form of something less threatening. 

One night, at around one in the morning, I was having a particularly difficult time practicing. 

Before I get into what happened, I feel I must explain a few things. The tiny practice room itself has a small square window on the door which looks out into the center where an upright piano stands. Each room has a piano and a very old metal music stand that creeks when you try to adjust its height. The walls are very thin, even people just listening to a youtube video can be heard from the next room over. Since the rooms are in the basement, everything from above, in the theater, can be heard. 

Once again, this story happened at around 1AM. I was the only one in the building. 

As I began to practice, things started getting... Strange. I heard, very clearly, a man's voice in my ear, causing me to whip around. Now, I am a paranoid person, so I brushed this off and just continued to practice. Then, from the next room over, I heard one of the music stands slide up. I peaked my head out of the practice room to see that I was still alone in the basement. I began to suspect that some spirit was probably messing with me or trying to get my attention. 

I heard doors opening and closing, whispers, footsteps and even a tap on the shoulder at one point. Finally, I had had enough. This was far from my first supernatural experience and so I thought I knew how to deal with this. I said aloud that if something was trying to contact me, I wouldn't be able to help them, and that since they were haunting the theater they must enjoy music. I told them they were more than welcome to listen to me practice.

I thinks that's what angered them. 

The entire place went eerily silent and I felt that perhaps whatever had been bothering me had left. As I opened my mouth to continue singing, from the next room over, I heard the music stand CRASH to the ground! That was enough, I began packing my things and as I looked out of the small window in the door, I saw a girl's head from the eyes up, peering at me. She had long black hair and her eyes pierced the darkness. I actually screamed when I saw this and ran out of the basement as quickly as I possibly could. 

The next day, I told my friend about my experience. She said I was crazy, but decided to write 'Ghosts and Dungeons' on the sign to the practice rooms. 

I haven't had any other experiences in these practice rooms, however, I refuse to go down to the basement alone at night. There is something in that space. It may not be sinister, however, I don't want to be down there to find out if it is."
"Our Grandparents House Was So Strange","Georgia","Haunted Places","While my parents, Allen and Natasha, were often away working with their Business (they ran an import company for various antiques and fine wines for many years). Because it was difficult to travel with three youngish children, my siblings and I were often left in the care of our Paternal Grandparents. 

Papa Charlie and Gran Florence were great and spoiled us rotten when we stayed with them. They lived in a 120 year old house in an upper class area of Atlanta, Georgia. Grandpa had been left it by his late Uncle Stephen who was a well known escentric. It was quite large (6 bedrooms and 4 full bathrooms and a ballroom which we used as a roller rink). The place was full of really weird art works and very old furniture but it was very very comfortable. It did have heating and air conditioning for when the weather required it. And baths with weird claw feet that were at least then seemed big enough to use as swimming pools (I was 5 at the time). 

My siblings (twin sisters who were 9 and a 3 year old brother) loved being there during the day but at night it felt strange. The place echoed strangely. Papa told us it was just the old house settling. 

We would have believed him if it was all just sounds. 

The first thing I noticed was this shadow that would move around the hallway it wasn't something you just saw gliding around on the wall like a common shadow. This thing looked like a solid mass of darkness. It was only the hallway we saw it but at different times and only at night. 

I tried to approach it and talk to it but it only moved away faster and disappeared into a painting on the wall (or maybe just into the wall). It never said anything, it never gave off any feeling good or bad. It just kind of came and went but it sure was strange.

Doors would open and shut, they were checked and rechecked for being badly fitted or having moved out of square due to their age. The locks were checked, the hinges were checked. Doors were taken down and rehinged and rehung but it still happened. You wouldn't see it happen and no one ever heard them open unless we personally opened them. They'd just be open. Then we would close them. They'd stay shut for a while and then open by themselves again. It was only the internal doors that did this. The front, back and side doors didn't open unless we opened them ourselves. This confused us all.

Another was the sound of a car with a big engine that was very loud would drive up our long curved driveway (we would hear it drive up to the door and the engine turn off) , many times we'd go out to see who it was but there was never anyone or any car there. A little while later it would start up again and we would hear it drive away again. 

Stranger still was the fact the front gates weren't only shut but locked tight and bolted. As it always was unless we were going out. 

Certain nights we'd hear singing (a lady with a beautiful voice) and a well played piano with music that sounded very old. Two problems with this; Firstly no one in the house knew the music that was being sung let known be able to sing it (many of us played instruments and my mother was a great singer but she wasn't around when this would happen), secondly there wasn't a functioning piano in the house. We had an old piano in the basement but it was broken (all the wires inside were broken by something we didn't know what and many keys were missing). And the piano sound came from the front lounge room and the singing from the ballroom area (were we roller skated as our grandparents pretty much didn't use it). 

There were many other things but this is something I thought I'd start with. If your interested I'll post the other weird happenings of that house and our holiday home in Florida. 

Sadly my Grandparents have since passed on to the reward they earned in the afterlife I miss them everyday. My uncle David and aunt Deb live in the house with my cousins now and I rarely visit as my work really doesn't give me much time.

Now and then though stories from my aunt and uncle and cousins filter down to me... The ghosts or whatever they are. Seem to still be around.

Thanks for reading. Sorry it's a bit long. 

Cars I can fix. Stories aren't my best thing but I try.

"Unexplained Event In My Grandfather's House","Ohio","Haunted Places","One the day before my twenty-fifth birthday my Maternal Grandmother passed away. She had been incredibly sick for several years, and on December Twentieth of 2017, she finally lost her fight, leaving our whole family devastated.

 For several days after my Grandmother's death, I stayed with my Aunt at her apartment-considering my mother and I were visiting Northern Ohio from our home in Kentucky when my Grandmother died-but I returned to my Grandfather's house on Christmas eve, which is where my story begins.

 First, I'd like to explain that my Grandmother was a very vocal person, never hiding what she felt. This experience, in my opinion, proves that she is still that way, now.

On Christmas day, my family decided to gather at my Grandfather's house for Christmas. All of us believing we should stick together. We spent the day preparing food, wrapping gifts, and making sure everything was ready. Everything was going well, despite the sadness everyone in the house felt, until I decided to shower before the party. 

I had decided to listen to the song ""Do I Wanna Know?"" by the Arctic Monkey, and turned it on repeat for the duration of my shower. Or, that was my intention, until the song suddenly changed to ""Supermarket Flowers"" by Ed Sheeran. 

For anyone who doesn't know this song, it was written by Ed Sheeran from his mother's prospective after the death of his grandmother. I was confused and sad, until I remembered having a conversation about that song with my mother the night before. I felt like my grandmother was telling me I needed to be there for my mom, and it had me in tears until I turned my music off.

If this was a one-time occurrence, I would have more than likely forgotten about it, but this has happened several times since I came home, leading to me no longer playing music during my showers; it always changes to the exact same song, no matter what playlist I have on. In a strange way it is comforting to know my grandmother still watches over us."
"Old Hag Syndrome And A Cross Earring","Missouri","Haunted Places","This morning I noticed in my right ear was a brass cross stud earring in the second hole of my earlobe that I didn't put in there. I wear the same silver stud earrings every day and change them out rarely. In the first holes on both sides I currently have sterling silver bees. In the second hole on the left is a tiny heart, on the right is a even smaller sterling silver ball. I have a third hole on the left but not on the right and it has a tiny silver ball. So I saw this cross in my ear alongside inside the same hole with the silver ball when I looked in the mirror. At first I didn't know what it was and then thought I must have somehow rolled onto an earring in my sleep so I went to pull it out and it wouldn't budge. So then I realized there was a post on the back holding it in place! So there was no way I could have just somehow rolled the back onto it.

 I have no idea where this earring came from. I have had weird ""sleep paralysis"" incidents over the years. I saw an old woman with a large dagger stab me in the stomach when I woke up in the mirror on the wall next to my bed. Also I have woken up not able to move or speak seeing some dark figure trying to get into my body. Also I have had my hair pulled and my shoulder tapped when nobody was there. I hear my name called occasionally.

 Last week I heard my dear Grandmother's voice, who is deceased, calling out for me. The only explanation for these things has to be a ghost or haunting of some kind. I was not asleep when any of these things happened. Some were upon waking but the rest I hadn't even been asleep. I'm assuming the earring incident happened when I was asleep though since it wasn't there yesterday and I don't recall myself or anyone putting it in my ear. Anyone have anything similar or theories?"
"Phone Call From Deceased Brother's Number","Texas","Misc","My brother, I'll call him M, took his own life in April, 2018. M had been terribly depressed and had not been well for a while, but despite all that my younger brother, J, his wife, S, and I did we could to help him. M had lived with J & S for 20 years on a ranch in Oklahoma and passed away there.

Four months after M's death and a week before his memorial service in Texas, where he grew up, I got a call from J. When I picked up there was nobody there and the line was dead. I looked at missed calls and saw the call from J and another from a number that looked very familiar, but I could not remember it right away. 

I called the number and a girl answered. She sounded like a teenager. I told her I had just missed a call from this number and she said she had not called anyone. I told her I thought I was calling my brother, M, back and she replied something like: ""Sorry, you called my number, but this is April."" I told her I was sorry to have bothered her and hung up.

I called my brother, J, and told him what had happened. After listening he said that he had tried to call and did not leave a message. J said the number I had called April on was M's old number that J had just cancelled. He asked me if I remembered a photo of M standing with a beautiful horse in a grassy field that had been taken years ago. I said I did. J told me that was the first horse M owned in Oklahoma and that her name was April.

After hanging up I checked my call history again. There was NO call received from M's old number, just my call to April.

There must have been something to this, but I have no idea what it is."
"Something Spooky Happened - Shadow People","Florida","Shadow People","Hey readers! I want to stop by, tell you what happened to me and my husband. This was not long ago. This happened in the last few days.

 My children where with their grandparents. My husband and I were tired, so we decided to lay down for a little bit and then get up and watch a movie. This was early around 5:00pm after the kids get back from school. They went to their grandparents for a sleepover. Our kids do that a few times a month and it's great. I like that they can see their grandparents. My mom lives with me so they get to see her too which is awesome.

 So at 5,we lay down and I think we both fell asleep not even 15 minutes later. Hours pass and I wake up and it's dark. I look

At the clock and it says 3:49. Then I look over and I see what I believe, to be is a shadow man. I don't know why I think the shadow person is a man but for some reason that is the feeling I got when I looked at it. My husband is lying right next to me. I tap him and ask him if he's up. He says yeah I am up but I have been laying here with my eyes closed.

 I say look over to the left. Do you see that? My husband looks over and says yes I do see that. We both just looked at him. He was tall. I would say a little more than 6 feet. He had a person's shape but no features on the face. I looked at him for a little bit and then fell back asleep.

 When I was looking at him I did feel scared. My husband and myself talked about him the next day and we couldn't think of a logical explanation. We both always try to be logical. But we honestly couldn't think of anything else but a shadow person. We both felt like he was a man. Just from the energy that I could feel. 

Thank you for reading 📖"
"A Hug From The Other Side","Utah","Family / Friends Visits","A few weeks ago my husband and I went camping. His mom and her husband own a beautiful patch of land that is nestled up against the eastern border of Zion National Park. Tall pines, grassy meadows. It's a little slice of heaven. Being a pagan, all nature is sacred to me, but there is something extra special about this place.

This patch of land also happened to be near where my grandpa once owned land. I never knew him. He worked outside building roads during the 1950's. This was a time when the US Government was conducting nuclear tests in the nearby deserts of Nevada. They claimed there would be no negative effects to the people of Southern Utah due to fallout from the blasts, but they were wrong. My grandpa died of cancer in 1964 when my mom was only 14, and while my grandmother was pregnant with their 5th child. From the stories I've heard, he had a gentle, quiet strength. He was slow to anger, and loved the outdoors. He would play the guitar while he and my grandma sang old western songs. Needless to say, his death caused a ripple of sadness in the family that has lasted through the generations. (Eventually in the 90's, a class action lawsuit was held against the US government, and my grandma, along with others, was finally given some reparations.) 

Anyway, back to my story. 

We hadn't been able to get out for a fun outing since I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer earlier this spring. Since then I've had two surgeries, and while they went well, it kind of shook up my summer. So this was a chance to get out of the house and soak up some nature medicine. I'd been thinking a lot about my grandpa ever since my diagnosis, but on this day, the thoughts of him had become constant. 

That night the moon was new as me and my husband sat around the crackling fire. The stars were brilliant and seemed to stretch through eternity. Still unable to pull my thoughts from my grandpa, I finally posed a question silently to myself ""What are outside influences that could be impacting my thought patterns? Is there perhaps a spiritual reason for this?"" Then I hear my own voice in my head say my grandpa's name. And I ask (in my head) ""Grandpa?"". A soft warmth wrapped itself around my shoulders and chest, like I was being hugged from behind. An exquisite warm peace filled my chest. The warmth around my shoulders faded that night, as did the constant thoughts of grandpa. But the peace in my heart remained. 

Was this the spirit of my grandfather, coming to show comfort and support as I battle with the disease that killed him? I'd love to know your thoughts or if you've had similar experiences with family who have passed on that you never knew in life."
"Kind Spirit In Our Mom's House","Washington","Haunted Places","This story has about two sides to it. I would like to mention a kind of background on my twin sister, and then talk about paranormal activity going on in this house my mom has moved into about 9 years ago.

Since the two of us were very young, for some reason, my sister has always had an interesting connection to the earth. We are half Native American, Apache Chiricahua, so my great aunt has said that may be a part of it. Ever since elementary school, my sister (I'll call her Isabel) has done weird things like spacing out, pointing and/or commenting at something I don't see, or even jumping like she is scared of something that isn't there. She used to tell me all about the things she saw, but as we have gotten older she has gotten to stop behaving that way and rarely talks about it anymore. But I recently saw, about a half year ago, her and both of our dogs staring at the corner of a room by the door. And then then door literally shut itself and opened again, which sent the dogs in a barking frenzy and my sister and I joked about there being a ghost in our mom's house.

But back to the first topic, for the longest time my sister has always mentioned there being a dark shadow-like figure that appears somewhere every day. It's apparently not exactly a person, it kind of looks like something similar. I think of No-Face from Spirited Away when she describes it, except without the mask and it has short legs. It changes its spot every time she saw it, it first being somewhere near the canal on our way to school, then outside one of her classrooms, then at our bus stop. She started getting uneasy, though, when it started getting near our home. Around that time, she started experiencing sleep paralysis almost every night. And when she would, she wouldn't see the figure, but she just couldn't move. But one night, she said that she knew she was in a sleep paralysis, but she was able to move. She turned around in her bed and directly next to her was the black shadowy figure, this time it had faint eyes and was in the bed with her, staring at her. She said she just turned around and went back to sleep because she was too tired to really put effort into being afraid of it. (A mood, but also?) 

Around that time, she also would wake up in the mornings with scratches on her arms and back (in places she cannot physically reach herself, because she is not very flexible). She doesn't have very long nails, because the two of us are wrestlers and you are supposed to keep your nails short so you can't scratch people in a match. We don't own a cat or dog in our dad's house, either.

This kind of reminds me of this ghost story called something like ""Mary"". It's about something you don't know getting closer to you. You get a phone call, and the person says ""This is Mary, I'm in front of your gate now."" The phone rings again in a little while, and they say ""This is Mary, I'm in front of your entryway now."" And then ""This is Mary. I'm in your entryway now."" I have never heard how the story ends, so I'm not really sure what it is. Since then, she has never told me about the strange shadowy figure, and she no longer wakes up with scratches or bruises.

And now for the second part:

Nine years ago, our mom moved away to Washington state (we live in California) and she got a house in a small ferry town across the Sound from Seattle. When my mom got the house, she tells me that when she was remodeling the back room, there was a section of the carpet that was a different texture. Like someone cut out a square of the carpet and replaced it with another kind. So they removed the carpet, and underneath it there was a big stain. Like red paint. According to my stepdad, who likes to hunt deer and elk, he knows what dried blood looks like and that was as if someone had bled out right there.

My mom looked up the history of the house and found that the wife of the man (an elderly man) who sold us the house had passed away. There was no information as to how, but my mom thinks she had slipped and hit her head on something and bled out in the back bedroom of the house.

Over the years when my sister and I would stay in that house during summer/winter/spring breaks, the doors constantly open and close themselves. Objects are misplaced. The dogs (and occasionally my sister too) stare at random spots of the house. One time, I swear to everything holy this happened, I was carrying two packs of toilet paper to put in the master bedroom, but my arms were full and I couldn't open the door. Then, the doorknob made and click and it opened by itself.

I don't know if it was just a draft or what, but my mind didn't know how to react at the moment, so I just said ""Thanks"", tossed the toilet paper into the bathroom, and on my way out the door shut itself behind me. And hard.

 I have no idea how to prove to you that was actually what happened, but I'm not here just to tell stories, I want answers.

 One night my mom was a bit drunk and was talking things like ""I'm telling you, she's here."" And I always ask who and she never answers anything except something along the lines of ""she's not mean or anything, but she's here.""

Just my daily dose of wtf, of course, but every time I visit my mom I can just feel something strange in that back room. It's not negative or scary. But it's something. *insert the meme* haha

Thank you for reading this long thing! I would love to know what exactly was happening to my sister that one time with the shadowy-like figure, and also any comments on this possibly kind woman roaming around in my mom's house. Feel free to ask me questions! I would love to discuss this with anyone haha sorry I'm so awkward"
"White Creature While On A Hike","Washington","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I am not the kind of person that really believes in the type of thing where all beings that aren't of this world are evil. I feel like there is another side to things, where there are beings that live quietly and do not want anything to do with us. I like to think that not all of them are particularly evil.

At the time, I was 16 (going on 17 in a few weeks) and it was a warm night in late July. My sister (calling her Isabel) and I were visiting my friend's house in Port Townsend for the weekend. After this incident I did some research and found the area is known for its paranormal activity.

So my friend (we'll call him Bailey) suggested we go to Fort Worden that night and do some ""ghost hunting"". My sister is the type that is always up for a thrill and I am too, though when I do I often chicken out but I don't act on it. I just act like I'm fine with the situation and keep going on.

Before you start telling me this is fake, I just want to clarify, I'm telling this story to maybe get some answers? I am not very knowledgeable about spirits or anything so I would appreciate some feedback! ♡

So that night before we left, I put on a long sleeved shirt and some jeans since this is a trail in the middle of the forest we're talking about, and I borrowed one of Bailey's hoodies because the color pattern made me think of Spider-Man. We're very obnoxious and joke around a lot.

So we set out to the Fort Worden trail at about 9:30 pm, and got there at 9:45. We each had a flashlight, but Isabel wanted to walk in the pitch black. My anxiety was telling me to leave the flashlight on because of wild animals like bears or cougars, but I really doubt they would want to come anywhere near people.

At the beginning of the hike, Bailey and Isabel were yelling things like ""come fight us, demons!"" ""Throw hands"" and then Isabel added ""Don't bother Yona, though, she is pure and doesn't want to hurt anything"". I'm apparently the good child lol

 After about an hour and a half of walking around the abandoned bunkers, climbing a creepy ladder, finding an abandoned house that was boarded up, I was started to get really anxious and asked if we could head back. My sister, of course, wanted to keep exploring, but Bailey said that we shouldn't push me to my limits and we decided to leave.

Now just something real quick. My sister has always been the kind of person to ""see"" strange objects that I have never seen. Ever since the two of us were little, she would point at things that were never there, stare at nothing, and jump like somebody has jump scared her. Even now, I have seen her and our dogs just stare at a corner of the room that had nothing in it. She also has had a history of random migraines with no cause, even now we're not sure what they are. She also used to constantly get sleep paralysis, one night I remember laying in bed on my phone, and she just randomly said ""are you awake? I can't move."" So I guess she is used to seeing weird things all the time.

Right as Isabel and I turned around, both of our flashlights caught something for just a split second. It looked like a person, but also not. It looked like they had just run and then jumped into the air and were jumping off the trail into the brush. It was completely white, like one of those Halloween costumes that cover your whole body. Their arms were flailing behind them, but they had such an abnormal length and angle, it didn't look exactly human. So of course, I let out a bit of a ""whoa"" and when my sister heard me, she yelled ""bruh!"". And then she turned to me and said something like ""did you see that?!"". Bailey didn't see it. She told me later that she was only so freaked out about it because I had seen it too. We both had the same exact description of what we saw, too.

So anyway, after that we all agreed to go home. When we were driving to the 24-hour Safeway my finger started having this aching/throbbing feeling and it hurt. So at the store I went to the bathroom and found I had a deep slice in my middle finger and was going to rinse off the blood. I rolled up my sleeve and found scratches on my arm. Not like cat scratches, or blackberry bush cuts, they had this crescent-like shape of a human nail, and had just barely broken the skin to make it bleed. I found a few more on my right hip and neck. I showed them to Bailey and Isabel, and the two were utterly horrified, even more so than I was.

I cleaned them with peroxide when I got home just to be cautious, and they all (except the one on my finger) disappeared within 3-4 days, and didn't even leave scars.

I did some research recently (it is now late September of the same year) and I found that Port Townsend is apparently known for its paranormal activity. My sister looked up some stuff as well and found that near the abandoned house we found, there were apparently sightings of something they called a ""man in blue"". I wouldn't say what I saw was wearing anything blue, though. I still think about that night and would like any ideas or answers as to what exactly happened. Feel free to ask me questions, please!"
"Is It Following?","California","Haunted Places","This just happened to me last night:

I was lying in bed with the lights off going through some emails on my phone when I hear a loud popping noise followed by something hard hitting the ceiling and then hitting me in the forehead. I sat up really fast and turned on the lamp, I sat there looking around my room thinking to myself ""what the hell was that?"". Then I noticed that a bottle of water that I had sitting on my nightstand was missing the cap. This cap is what probably hit me in the head, I don't know where the cap bounced off to, I did not get up to look for it but I'm sure the bottle of water had the cap on when I went to bed and turned off the lamp. I have absolutely no idea how it uncapped, flew up, hit the ceiling and then bounced down to hit me in the forehead. The only content in the bottle was water; it did not look like it had been squeezed and the bottle was sitting upright, no water had been spilled.

 I laid right back but this time left the light on and went right back to reading emails. This is when I started feeling a touching sensation on my feet, instead of kicking my feet, as I've done before, I stayed still and turned to look at my feet and saw that the blanket was very slowly moving up my feet exposing them. I was slow in reacting, I just sat there staring at my feet for a few seconds until reality hit me and I flew up and ran out of the room. I didn't want to scare my son so I stayed outside my bedroom mustering the courage to go back in. Needless to say, sleep was a long time coming. 

This happened a couple of days ago:

I had a friend over and we were going to have tea; I was standing by the stove waiting for the water to boil, she was sitting on a stool at the breakfast bar talking to me. Suddenly, one of the burners just lights up and freaks us both out. No idea how that happened, I had been standing there for at least 5 minutes and never touched any of the knobs except for the one where the teapot was, the knob for the burner that turned on by itself was not near the one that was already lit. 

Also happened a few days ago:

I was using the restroom and I hear light knocking on the door so I tell my son, ""wait, I'll be done in a minute"". I'm washing my hands when I hear the knocking again, this time louder, so now I'm upset and yell ""I said to wait, If you can't wait go downstairs and use the other restroom""! Both times I didn't hear anything back. When I get out I could hear my son in his bedroom so I go in and tell him the bathroom is now free, he looks at me like I'm weird and says ""okay?"". I told him ""well it sure sounded like you couldn't wait"". He swears he never knocked on the bathroom door. He and I were the only ones home; the cat was sound asleep in my son's bedroom.

My kids were out with friends one day, I was the only one home. I was in bed reading a book when I hear someone outside my bedroom say ""mommy"". I automatically answer ""yes, I'm in here"". Then there was silence at which point I remembered my kids are not home, sadly they don't call me mommy anymore, and my kids are teenagers, the voice that I heard was that of a much younger child. 

I have no idea what is going on. I've had paranormal incidents happen to me before but things had been quiet for a long time. I can't really pinpoint what has stirred things up. I have some weird stuff going on in my house in Mexico right now but all of these incidents have happened to me in my house in California. Psychics have told before me that I have a ""very bright and powerful light"" and that I attract ghosts both good and bad. To be honest, I never believed them because I don't have any ""special"" abilities that they talk about or at least I don't know how to use them or even begin to know what they are. I don't really think I want to know. I don't want any random ghosts in my house and if it's a dead relative then that's even worse because I feel they are here to warn me about something, or if they're here to comfort me that means I'm going to need comforting. I also don't like the idea of them having any unfinished business, I want them to be at peace. 

I did a house cleansing in the house in Mexico a couple of weeks ago, don't know if it worked since I haven't been back since then. I'm going back this weekend, hopefully it worked. 

My question is this, could I have brought these ghosts with me from my other house when I did the cleansing?"
"The Loft Of 303","Pennsylvania","Haunted Places","My name is Shan Iwanicki and this is my true ghost story. I wanted to move from the city of Philadelphia to Downingtown, a suburb of Philadelphia, as it was an easier commute for me to my job. After careful hunting, I found the most beautiful loft apartment and for an amazing price.

Prior to moving, I had toured the loft I wanted to live in for obvious reasons. However, I had a choice of third floor loft or second floor, one story with less room. I opted for the third floor loft for a few hundred bucks more per month and felt it would be safer for me to be away from the lower levels. 

Upon signing the lease and completing formalities for paperwork, I was told that the loft I had toured originally was suddenly not available. I was told there was only one loft left and this is the one I moved into that June summer day. I did not mind as they promised it had been repainted and freshly carpeted. So, for me, this option was a bonus and with a great view of the pool. I was excited to move in to my new place and be closer to my busy job.

All was quiet in this old historical town when I moved in, or so I thought. The building I lived in was only five or so years old and I liked the idea of living in a place that was fairly new; new appliances, new carpet and no history; fresh start.

The first year I lived there, I was working long hours at my job and often came home late. During this time, I had no encounters in my loft. However, I did not spend a lot of time there either to notice anything unusual. 

About a year and a half or so later my boyfriend, who commuted from New York City to see me every weekend, was there on a Friday night and arrived early. He asked me what there was to do around the Halloween season. Steve, my boyfriend, enjoys ghostly stories of any kind, although he is somewhat of a skeptic. He wanted to do some scary activities for Halloween; I began to research what was in the area of my town. I discovered on the internet a house about four miles away, allegedly known to be the Witch House, located in Exton Pa. This house's origin was from the late 1700s. Apparently, legend has it that four family members practiced witchcraft. Allegedly, they were buried there and now the graves are missing. I did not read too much more about the house as it made me scared a bit. I shared this with Steve and he wanted to check it out.

We found the location of the house, but you needed to walk through a bit of woods, over a billy goat bridge and over a tiny stream to get there. I decided to stay in the car while he explored. It was a cold evening and he was gone a while; I became nervous. Finally, he came back to the car and was elated by the house and the story of it. He told me how creepy the house was and the graffiti, wood covered windows where life once took place made everything feel so creepy. I actually nick-named the house Creepy House. He seemed to like the mystery of the place, and I normally like scary stuff, but I was not too interested in being part of this creepy house.

Later that week, I shared with my sister the story of the house. She was due to stay with us, and told me she wanted to see it too. I was still undecided!

A few days after Steve visited the Witch House some very odd things began to happen in my loft. Due to Steve's commute, I was alone during the week and I began to feel really uneasy. I could not describe the events to Steve because I felt embarrassed. I just felt like I was being watched from the loft above the living room. I had 24 foot ceilings and would look up after feeling a cold draft or a flash out of the corner of my eye or shadows crossing the kitchen wall to the stairs. My guest room and office were located in the loft and I developed a fear of going up there. The air felt heavy up there, and I seemed to get the cold prickly feelings on my arms and the back of my neck when I did go up there. My visits to the upstairs loft declined rapidly once this nightmare began.

The first real event I experienced was one Sunday afternoon, late October, I was watching football alone and I heard a scraping sound coming from the kitchen, directly under the loft. I dismissed it at first and kept watching football. The sounds became louder from the kitchen, enough for me to get up and investigate the annoying sound. I looked at the corner in between two cupboards and saw the vinyl wood strip slowly being peeled away from the cupboard. I gasped because it was still moving slowly down the corner right in front of me. I freaked a bit and ran back to the couch and just stared out of the window to shake it off.

I went to bed that night with normal routine, but I laid in bed with curious thoughts as to what happened earlier that day. I was trying to debunk what I had witnessed. I rested on the notion that it was a strange incident and not to worry about it. Self-talk! From that Sunday forward, things were about to take a very deranged road.

A few days after this incident another strange thing happened and from there, my nightmare was unfolding. I had no idea that the paranormal was knocking inside my house and within the confines of my loft and what I thought safety should have been when I signed my lease the year before. Why now? 

A few nights later, after the self-talk, I came home from work late and all I wanted to do was take a hot shower and go to bed. I was exhausted from the day and the fear that was keeping me awake many nights in a row. I took the hot shower and then proceeded to do what people do when they are in the bathroom. All of a sudden, the bathroom door just started moving slowly and with a creaking sound. It was as if the door had control in its movements. I was watching it slowly move and with such steady conviction. On one side of the coin, I was mesmerized by the motion and on the other side of the coin, I was scared straight while I was sitting. The door moved slowly into the complete open position and then stopped. I said out loud, ""HELLO, can you give me some privacy?"" I was trying to be funny in a very frightful moment. 

All of a sudden, the door began to move slowly the other direction and with the same momentum, creaks and all. I think I stayed on the sitter for a while until I was numb. While sitting there for a long while, frozen with fear, I smelled cigar smoke. Heavy-heavy, old school, cigar or pipe tobacco-smoke. I know this smell as my Dad used to smoke a pipe and cigars. I remember the heavy scent that was left to linger behind; old cheap tobacco.

I finished my business and washed my hands. I stared in the mirror. I splashed water in my face, even though I had showered thirty minutes before, and tried to collect my strength and logic. I rationalized the smoke smell with the thought that the neighbors must be smoking, even though we lived in a non-smoking building. I then moved on to the rationale of the door. I began to justify the door moving with wind or a draft. I knew deep down this was not the reason. None of the windows were open and it was a cold November evening and one does not leave windows open at night, especially when you live alone. I finally made it to bed, shivers and a bit of the crazy shakes. I began to tell Steve much more with all of these incidences occurring, but he was not shocked and not too concerned. He is of the school of thought that he needs to experience it to believe it fully.

The following weekend Steve arrived on schedule Friday night and what to do? I was tired from the week and much happening on the work front, loads of stress. I retired to bed early that Friday night and Steve stayed up to watch his programs on TV. I fell fast asleep because I felt safe with him there and I felt I did not need to worry about these strange things occurring on his watch. 

The following morning, we had breakfast and I joked with him about seeing or witnessing any sightings of my ghost. He looked at me so seriously and said, ""Actually, I heard heavy footsteps back and forth along your long hallway late in the night."" He said he was calling for me and wondering if I needed anything. In other words, he thought I was up to use the bathroom. He got up to look and no one was there. He peaked in the bedroom and there I was, fast asleep. I looked at him and said, ""SEE?"" He shrugged his shoulders and that was that. I am actually surprised he said anything at all. Steve is a sensitive man, gentle man, but he needs proof. Anything that can be debunked, will be! I said to him that it is odd that he heard such loud steps; my apartment had thick new carpeting.

Steve left that Sunday evening and I always got a bit sad when he would leave. I knew I would see him in four days, but I always felt a bit empty and scared when he would go. That night, I went to bed around 10, normal time I guess, and I laid in bed with a bit of anxiety. I was thinking about all of the events that had occurred so far and why. I was trying to figure out why and why now? I am a proponent to always find logic, usually. In this crazy period of time, I seemed to not find success with any sort of logic. I decided to throw logic out the door and go for the unknown explanations, even if it made me scared. Thus far, I had only discussed this time period of fear with Steve and my sister. How does one discuss this at the water cooler for a break and chatter while at work? The answer is, one does not!

Hours after Steve had left, I finally fell asleep. During the night, I thought I had heard some strange loud noises in the living room. I was so tired of it all, I willed myself to sleep. 

When I woke up in the am for work (I always made coffee first thing), I was staring into the living room waiting for the coffee to finish brewing and I noticed all of my DVDs were strewn about the floor. A real mess! I said out loud, ""What the f##k."" I walked over to the mess and was dismayed once again. I carefully put all of the DVDs back on its shelf. I thought to myself, how does this happen? I conducted an experiment. I randomly scooted the DVDs onto the floor to see how they would land and found that there was some order. I GOT SCARED!

As I walked away from the mess I now just made with the DVDs, I turned to the patio and noticed the Angel statue was facing the wall. I had a very tall Angel that my sister bought me and I have had it in every place I have lived. I saw the Angel facing the wall, and I knew then, I have an entity or evil something living here. What do I do?

I scrambled to get ready for work haphazardly and left with smoke behind my tires. All day at work, I could not concentrate. I was researching ghostly encounters, ghost busters, blessings, and strange phenomenon. All this research did for me was FREAK ME OUT MORE! I calmed down and began to research my area. All I could find was the old history of the town. The town was sitting on the Brandywine River. A river that was pretty active during the Civil War. This River was once a haven for drinking water and movement of canoes and troops. Additionally, the path I lived was on the way to Gettysburg, only about an hour away. Yet I could not help but to think that this was not the reason for the haunting. My mind kept creeping back to the Witch House. I slipped out of denial and realized that maybe, just maybe, the Witch Ghosts attached to Steve when he visited there a month before and he brought them home to the loft. This is the only thing that made sense. I had not experienced anything up until he visited the house for over a year. AND NOW, POW! I think I solved the mystery. OR DID I?

There never seemed to be any particular pattern with some of these unexplained happenings. This was even more upsetting because I never knew what or when to expect an oddity of circumstances. My mind would wander while I was working, and I would explain things to Steve, yet I felt really alone in what was happening. Who do I talk to about these freaky and unexplained events? Did I even consider calling a professional to check things out? I did not!

At this stage, I would dread coming home to a place I once loved so much. It was a beautiful loft and well decorated. It was perfect for me and my lifestyle, but at this point it was scary and I felt uneasy being there. I began to feel like I was being watched all of the time. The smell of cigar smoke seemed to be fluid through the house to the point where I had to accept it. I did not like that I was succumbing to this paranormal activity and potential being that may be habituating my house and my life.

One night I came home from work and it was very dark outside. I placed my key in the door and turned it up to unlock; pulled my key out because this is how it unlocks. When my key left the door lock, I heard the inside latch lock again. I placed my key in the lock again, and turned the key up and pulled the key out, and heard it latch another time. I tried to open the door, but it was still locked. In other words, my key was not unlocking the door and it was as if someone was on the other side of the door trying to prevent me from getting in. I was so frustrated and scared that I started back down the stairs. I was headed to the manager's office; halfway down the stairs, I heard it unlock. WHAT? So, up the stairs I go! I turned the doorknob with the key and it was UNLOCKED!

Looking back, I can't believe I actually went inside. I guess, at the time, it was my home and where would I go? I was not from Philadelphia. I was from New York and Minnesota. I was just there for a job contract. Where would I go? Do I tell the management office that I think my loft apartment is haunted? 

When I went inside, to the immediate left were the stairs to the loft. Suddenly it dawned on me. The reason I took the more expensive place was for the loft. I am not going to let this, whatever it is, take my house. I dropped my purse and walked up the stairs to the loft; heart pounding and sweat on the forehead. As I rounded the stairs, I felt nauseous. The air felt heavy up there and unsettling, but everything was in order. I quickly came down the stairs and parked myself on the sofa and watched comedy to get my mind off of what was happening around me. I was afraid to be up there!

I would speak to Steve every night, and began to share more and more every day with him. Knowing more about him as I do now, he would have been more receptive to all of this had I given him the chance.

*It is now getting closer to Thanksgiving and soon my sister would arrive. At this point, I had only told her a few things. I was joking with her and said, ""You get to stay in the loft guest room with the ghost."" She laughed and said, ""Cool."" Some more events occurred before my sister was due to arrive; believe me it only seemed to get malicious.

Another evening, I was watching TV and the lights in my kitchen started randomly fluttering; just non-sensible flickering. I tried to debunk this event to an electrical issue. I knew this was not the case deep down, but I guess one turns right on Denial Road when things happen that can't be explained and ashamed of the happenings. I knew at this point, that I absolutely had paranormal activity in my house and I needed to deal with IT. Unfortunately, I never really dealt with IT! Between denial and acceptance battling each other constantly, one tends to feel like they are going mad. I know I did.

After this last event, nothing much happened for a few weeks. I was so relieved for the break. This is the time that I began to feel like I was paranoid and that I had only imagined everything that had happened so far. Again, I was trying to debunk all of it which is why I did not really speak to anyone but Steve and my sister regarding the events. 

Finally my sister arrived for Thanksgiving. Steve, Terry and I sat down for turkey and the fixings. We had an amazing time. I had explained to Terry thus far what all had occurred. She had no issues staying up in the loft in the guest room; she is not afraid of ghosts.

Later that evening she was cleaning the dinner dishes and I decided to take out the trash. When I came back and opened the door, I saw Terry looking at something on the counter. A glass slid slowly across the counter and smashed into to Terry's hand. She was holding a glass as well, and the two collided. She looked at me and said, ""I GET IT!"" I asked her if she was scared and she said, ""NO."" I decided to go with her attitude and thought I would carry on with the same attitude, that I did not care and maybe this was all my imagination and it would go away. Will it stop? I had hoped so.

My sister wanted to see the Witch House/Creepy House! All three of us, Steve, Terry and me, went for a walk through the woods, over the bridge and to the property. I felt so uneasy being there. It was dark, and there were abandoned buildings all over the property. We walked everywhere. We even viewed where the graves were supposed to be. Another legend, the witches were hanged and buried standing up. We peeked in a few cracks in the wood that covered the windows. It was hard to see anything inside. I think my sister was scared now. We left, finally! Although my sister was scared after the tour of the creepy Witch House, surprisingly she did not experience anything upstairs in the loft. Once again, this made me feel paranoid. I know she believed me regardless.

After my sister had left, I decided to get some maintenance work done on my apartment loft. I placed a work order to management to have the cupboard strip replaced and for the electricians to look at the lighting in my kitchen. I left the work order with the management office which gives the maintenance team permission to enter the apartment while I am not home. All the while, I am at work and thinking positive that everything that had been happening was a figment of my mind and took solace that the maintenance team would fix the electrical outlets, etc. I convinced myself that all of the events were random coincidences and moving forward there would be no further activity. Why would there be? I was paranoid!

I came home late that evening, about 8:00 or so, and as I was driving into the parking lot, I looked up to my apartment balcony and noticed all of the lights were on in my apartment and the balcony door was opened; wide open. I was stumped. I thought this was strange because I had received a text from the management office when maintenance was about to enter my place at around 1pm. I headed up the three story walk up and as I landed on the last step, I noticed the maintenance keys were still in my door and the door was ajar an inch. My door was the first door on the right, at the top of the stairs; it was pretty easy to see the huge key ring dangling from the door. The maintenance keys looked like a janitor key ring with 100s of keys on a ring. In hindsight, I should have never entered the apartment because of the unknown of the other side. I assumed maintenance was still inside with the keys dangling from the door knob.

I opened the door and said, ""Hello."" I was fully in the apartment with the maintenance key ring in my hand and I said again, ""Hello, I am home and you left the keys in the door."" No one answered, no one!

As I proceeded through the apartment, every light was on. Every light. The patio door was wide open, and the loft lights upstairs were on too. My house was lit up like a city. Then, I really took notice of the apartment, confused by the keys and no one being there, all of the cupboards and drawers were wide open too. Every cupboard and every drawer and every light was on. Now I am scared, but already committed to being inside and no turning back now. It never occurred to me that it was burglary. I was more worried about paranormal. This seems funny to me even now.

I went into the bedroom, checked under the bed, checked the walk-in closets, and checked all of the closets, bathroom and... The loft. No one was there! I quickly ran down the staircase into the kitchen to see where the work order sheet was and note of completion. The maintenance team would always leave a note of completion or to be continued. There was no note, no one, and no explanation of the scene I had found. I left quickly with the ring of keys in my hand and ran to the management office as I know they close at 9pm. I felt that I needed to get to the bottom of this Colombo situation.

Marilyn was working the desk. I must have looked frightened because she asked me if I was all right. I said, ""No, actually."" I sat down and told her what had happened. She looked to become white as a ghost. I am presuming here, she looked to be, NOT SURPRISED and almost expecting an eventual complaint regarding the loft. I asked a series of questions: why would they leave keys in my door and the door unlocked placing my security in jeopardy? She did not have an answer. I asked why they would leave all of the lights on and kitchen cupboards, etc open? She told me that they had been working on the lights and the cupboards so perhaps this is why. I said, ""OK."" I was not satisfied with the conversation. I told her they never finished the completion order or anything. I also told her that every light was on and every drawer was opened. 

In hindsight to this, she never offered to call the police. I received no explanation. Never did! I did not follow up either because I was frustrated. I called Steve that evening and he said he would be on his way from New York. Steve was a detective for NYPD. I convinced him that he did not need to and knew that by the time he would reach me it would be midnight.

I went home and turned off most of the lights, closed the drawers, cupboards, etc. I poured a big fat glass of wine and asked myself what the he## happened here?

Later that evening, after I had calmed down, I heard a noise in the hallway. I walked over to the hallway and noticed footprints on the rug. The rug was flipped over halfway as if someone had tripped over it. I pulled the rug back and there were footprints on it. Of course, I tried to debunk this too. I thought for sure it was the maintenance footprints, but how did the rug flip over like that?

Why am I still here? I am stubborn! Most people would have fled the scene. NOT ME! Stubborn Irish I guess...

Things continued to happen in the apartment. I had never received an apology from the management or any explanation as to why the maintenance team fled that day. I know why. Something scared the daylights out of them. I began to wonder if this is why they switched my apartment last minute. Perhaps the people before me left suddenly too. I guess I will never know.

Things at my job were growing grim. Our company was in big financial trouble. We all were told we would be laid off in a few months. I actually felt relieved. I knew I could get out of my lease and move back to New York with my boyfriend and get the heck out of this ghostly loft. This is what kept me from leaving sooner. I knew there was a light at the end of the tunnel and around the corner; I would not enjoy living like this any longer. Suddenly, I did not feel afraid anymore. In fact, this was my new attitude again, NO FEAR!

It was now getting close to Christmas time and work hours calmed down for me. I was getting home earlier and was able to do more cool things after work without being stressed for time. I had accepted the lay off and that I would be moving. I think IT was not very happy with the notion of my upcoming move. I began to slowly pack up things. I had until January to move out, but I wanted to get ahead of time. I went to bed one night and I was drifting off to sleep. Suddenly, I awakened with the sound of heavy breathing in my ear. Heavy, heavy breathing that did not seem human. Heavy breathing in my ear like the sound of an animal that is on defense mode. Aggressive, heavy and winded breathing.

I was frozen with fear. I laid there as still as I could and did not move. I think I even stopped breathing for a minute. My heart was pounding so hard, and tears were streaming down my face. I actually cried myself to sleep, fear and tears. A few hours into my sleep, I woke up to feeling very cold around my neck and the back of my head. VERY COLD! I fully woke up to shivering, my teeth were chattering as well as my body. I could not move, I don't know why, but I could not move a muscle. I looked up at the ceiling and saw a black blob mist float across my ceiling and out the window. I could not believe what I had just seen. I still could not move, not a muscle. After a few minutes, the room became warm again. I checked the clock and it read 3:15am. I got up to go the bathroom and get a drink of water and shake this off. 

I eventually fell back to sleep. A few hours later, I woke up to the bed shaking violently. VIOLENTLY. My legs were running fast in bed. I sat straight up and said, ""STOP IT, STOP IT NOW, I AM NOT AFRAID OF YOU AT ALL, LEAVE ME ALONE."" I laid back down, and said out loud, ""YES."" I recreated the running in bed with my legs to see if the bed would shake violently like I had just experienced, and it did not. I KNEW! I guess a part of me is that I if I continued to debunk these events all along, then no one can dismiss my story.

After this night, I began packing like a maniac and with due attentiveness. I knew I was leaving and I could not wait to get out of there. A part of me felt like toying with this thing that shared residence with me. The more, I actually felt unafraid, the more it seemed to toy with me. I equally feel that it knew I was not afraid of it. I had two more weeks in the place, and I experienced a few more things.

I researched a Ouija Board on the internet, but then decided this was not a good idea. I closed the page and shut down my computer. I woke up in the morning and made coffee. I picked up my computer to pack it for work and the Ouija Board appeared there. Holy sh##. 

Over the course of the two weeks, I felt cold spots everywhere in the apartment, my TV in my room would just turn on full volume by itself, the TV in the living room would do the same, the towels in my bathroom would land on the floor almost every day, shadowy figures floating on the far wall by the kitchen and under the loft, the pictures leading up the stairs to the loft would be hanging upside down, the hammer in my laundry room would fall on the floor more than a few times, my purse would crash to the floor often, the smell of pipe or cigar smoke became thick in scent, the creeks in the hallway were part of the normal sounds of the loft and the nauseous feeling I had become constant. I refused to let it know I cared or feared it.

I slept in bed from this point forward with a dresser in front of my bedroom door. How dumb? I was desperate to find comfort in sleeping and not sharing my dreams with IT. I even went as far as placing ribbons in the doorframes to see if they were disturbed at night or if they had moved. Again, how dumb?

I moved January 1st that year. I moved due to the layoff, but it was perfect timing. I never looked back until now. I do believe that something from the witch house followed Steve to my loft. It stayed with me at the loft, it lived with me, it watched me, it toyed with me and it hated me. I often wonder if it is still there. I can never forget the happenings, never!

I don't believe the haunting had anything to do with the Civil War and/or any past events. I could not find anything that may have been the reason for the haunting through my research. I am not a paranormal expert, but I am pretty good at logic. I laugh as I say that because looking back at all of this, I had no logic while it all was happening. I was wise enough to document the events long back. I will never forget the loft and the IT that moved in with me. 

My final thoughts are: do these things follow you? I have my reasons for saying this."
"The Grim Reaper","Pennsylvania","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I came across this site randomly a few days ago while searching for good ghost stories to read and I have been hooked ever since. I love ghost stories and things of that nature so I thought I'd share an experience I had with you. 

When I was around the age of 13 or 14, my family was renting a duplex in Pittsburgh. We were getting ready move and looking through old boxes to determine what could be thrown out prior to moving.

At this particular time of the day I was the only one at the house and I decided to look through this box with old place mats in my dining room. My dining room had this large clock that was a mirror. Through the mirror you could see into the kitchen that was separated by a dividing wall. 

I honestly have no idea why I decided to do this, but I held this old-see through place mat up to my face while looking into the mirror. As soon as I put the mat up to my face, this dark hooded figure jumped out behind me. I immediately looked behind me but nothing was there. I was so scared. I honestly thought I saw the grim reaper that day and all because I was being weird and putting a place mat up to my face. 

I associate the grim reaper with death but I do not recall anyone close to me passing away at that time so possibly I'm misinterpreting this figure. Maybe someone has a different theory. 

I have two other occurrences that have happened in that house. It's been a long time since I've lived there and I can honestly say I've never really experienced anything since. I will most likely post the other two occurrences here shortly. Thank you for taking the time to read this!"
"Encounter With A Poltergeist, Perhaps?","Utah","Haunted Places","I was about 14. I had gotten permission from my parents to spend a weekend at a friend's (let's call her Cindy) house a few hours away in Escalante, UT. 

I remember being driven through town, face pressed against the window, gawking at the beautiful old adobe houses. I've always loved places with history, and Escalante seemed to brim with echos of the old west. I was positively thrilled to find that one such house was where Cindy lived, and where I'd be staying. 

This house had to have been around 90-100 years old. The floors and doors were creaky. The windows were clouded with age. There was even a creepy basement. I was in heaven. 

Cindy was in her early twenties, and the only ""adult"" around. Her younger sister was there, as well as another friend. We didn't do anything crazy besides eat junk food and stay up late watching silly movies. At one point we went to a rodeo, which I absolutely hated. I would have been pretty content to sit and read the whole weekend. One of the afternoons, I opted out of a walk to the store in favor of burying my face in a book. I was the only one who stayed behind, and I was relieved to have a few quiet moments alone.

I was sitting on the floor in the living room of the home. It was dead silent. Then I heard a faint creak. I didn't look up from my book. ""This house is old, and old houses make noises,"" I told myself. To my right was a short hallway where the door to Cindy's bedroom was open wide. Suddenly the door slammed shut with a BANG. My head snapped up, and my breath stuck in my throat. I continued to try and rationalize. ""The window is probably open and a gust of wind blew it shut. Yeah, that's it."" I shook it off and returned to my reading. A few minutes pass. Then I hear what sounds like a doorknob turning. I again look up at the door and to my shock, it is slowly opening. I freeze.

As soon as Cindy and the others returned, I frantically recounted what had happened. They teased me relentlessly, and I was completely embarrassed. I fell out of touch with them through the years, and it's not a story I've told many, for fear of a similar reaction. 

I've rehashed these details in my head for the past 20 years. Here's a possible non-paranormal explanation: there were multiple windows open in the home, and a cross breeze slammed the door shut and the doorknob, being nearly as old as the house, had malfunctioned to the point where it would not stay latched. Then, another faint breeze came through from a different open window, and slowly pushed the door ajar. Maybe? Any thoughts?

Whether the event was paranormal or not, I will never forget it. 

Thanks for reading. I've been on this site a few times to read your experiences, but this is my first post. 

Blessed Be!"
"Repossessed Living Room Set Or Possessed?","Virginia","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","My name is Christopher and my story takes place between the Virginia and North Carolina line, back in 2012. 

I worked for a furniture store delivering merchandise to our customers (living rooms, bedrooms, dining rooms, washers/dryers etc.) On this day at work, our morning load consisted of two deliveries and one service call. This was a pretty easy morning run for me and my co-worker Kalvin, which meant that we would be able to load up the truck, do our deliveries and get back to the store fairly early for our lunch break and get the truck loaded up for the afternoon load of deliveries. 

The first delivery went great, nice and easy job. We headed off to our second stop and that is when we got a phone call from our manager that would change the rest of our day, our night, and most honestly the rest of our lives, even though we were unaware of this at that point in time. 

Kalvin answered the phone as I drove the work truck towards our second stop of the day. Kalvin spoke into the phone ""yes, ok, no problem, just give me an address."" and then hung up the phone. I worked this job long enough to know that a phone call like that meant one thing: more work for us. 

As Kalvin hung up the phone I asked him, ""Where we going?"" ""Airport Road in Roanoke Rapids, picking up a living room set from a couple. Our manager said we need to get there right away while someone is there to let us in the residence,"" he said. As my brain processed the situation I said, without much thought involved, ""Airport Road, isn't that a trailer park?"" When he said yes, I said ""You got to be kidding me. I just moved that living room set there two weeks ago from there old address in Halifax, NC."" I knew the house Kalvin was talking about and as I said that he replied, ""Oh yeah, I know who this is now. What the hell are we picking this living room up for?"" 

Working this job for a few years we learned the only two reasons people return their stuff. Either the furniture gets too torn up and they don't want to continue paying for it or that they get very far behind on their payments. And since we just moved their living room set two weeks ago for them, we both knew that they could not be overdue on their payments. So we stopped heading to the next delivery and started driving towards Airport Road in Roanoke Rapids. 

After reaching the trailer on Airport Road, we noticed a white Ford F-150, and a Sheriff deputy's car parked out front. Both mine and Kalvin's heads went to the same conclusion that they wee being evicted and our boss sent us here to return the living room set before the customers were removed from the residence. 

As I backed the truck into the yard, Kalvin jumped out of the truck to direct me as close to the trailer porch as I could go. As I stepped out of the truck, a tall older white man approached me and Kalvin and introduced himself as the father of the lady who lived there, thanked us for getting to the house so quickly and continued to walk us inside to retrieve the living room set. 

As we walked in to the house we didn't notice anything alarming and went right to picking up the lamps, walking them out to our truck, and returning to pick up the end tables. On our third trip back inside, Kalvin tipped the couch back some so I could pull the side of the throw rug out from under the couch. I was on my hands and knees as I did this and after pulling the rug out some, I started to take the rug and roll it up to take it out of the home. By the time I got about two rolls of the rug I noticed the underside of the rug was wet and puddled up underneath it was blood soaked on the underside. I froze in shock for a minute and as I looked up I seen Kalvin looking at me and could see exactly what I seen. I stood up and excused myself as I walked out of the house and Kalvin followed me out. 

I grabbed the work phone and called my manager and explained to him that the rug was covered in blood and would need to be thrown out. He stopped me and explained that the couple that lived there were murdered a few days ago and it was explained to him that the merchandise had already been cleaned before we got there, to load the stuff in the truck and get out of there to finish our next stop. Kalvin and I just looked at each other like ""What the hell? This is so messed up"" and headed back inside to finish getting the stuff out of the house. After rolling up the rest of the carpet and getting the couch and loveseat out of the residence, we closed up the back of the truck and headed out to our next stop. 

We were both a little speechless for a few minutes on our ride to the next stop, but after about twenty minutes we started talking again and discussing what had just happened. We both where aware of the couple that lived there, we been to their homes a few times for deliveries and service calls but didn't know them personally. We did know the guy sold drugs out of the trailer, and his girl worked at a strip club in Rocky Mount, NC. As we talked we both kind of started to think of what could have happened to them and while doing so, may have said some things that were not appropriate considering two people just lost their lives a few days ago. 

As we approached our next stop of the day, which was a service call on a refrigerator, we got back into professional mode and went into the house, fixed the fridge and were headed out to leave after about twenty minutes. As I got into the truck to leave, I put the key in the ignition and turned the key to start the truck, but nothing happened. The lights flickered and a clicking sound came from the ignition but nothing else. I pulled the key out and tried again, nothing happened. All them years of driving this truck and going everywhere in this truck, nothing like this ever happened before. After about 10 minutes of playing around trying to get the truck to start, it finally started. Me and Kalvin where speechless. We both said that we hoped this had nothing to do with the living room set that was in the back of the truck. That kind of freaked me and Kalvin out to the point where we didn't talk about that delivery the rest of the trip and headed back to the store to go to lunch. The rest of the day went by fine with no real problems. We unloaded the living room set before doing our afternoon deliveries, finished off the day and went home. 

That night at my house, I told my wife about what happened that day at work. She thought it was wrong of my employer to send Kalvin and I to go pick up the living room set that a few days earlier was the scene of a homicide and believed I was just over-reacting to our work truck malfunctioning. 

As we were in bed asleep that night, I found myself awoken by a noise. I opened my eyes but stayed in place trying to listen to the quite environment around me to try and understand what just woke me up. As I layed on my side with my back to the hallway and my back to our open bedroom door, I heard loud heavy footsteps start walking down our hallway. I did not think intruder or burglar. I thought instantly it was our little boy Damon. It was not uncommon for Damon to wake in the middle of the night crying and coming into our bedroom to wake us. Damon was about five at the time. 

As the footsteps came to stop at the end of the hallway, which had hardwood floors to the entrance of our bedroom that had carpet, I notice the light shining on our bedroom wall. The hallway light suddenly got blocked out by the sold outline of a human shadow. A man standing at our door looking into our bedroom at my wife and I sleeping. My mind was still under the impression that it's our son Damon coming into our bedroom to see if me or his mom was awake. As I layed on my side, eyes wide on this figure that is blocking the light on my wall, my only thought was do not move. If Damon sees I am up he will not go back to sleep tonight, he will want to stay in our room. 

After what felt like three to four minutes the figure turned and walked out of our doorway and down the hall. That is when the footsteps snapped me out of my thinking. Those foot steps are the footsteps of a heavy, full-grown male with work boots, not the footsteps of a 55 pound, 5 year old boy in socks. I froze in horror as my mind raced, thinking there was an intruder in our home. As the footsteps made it down the hall into our carpeted living room, I heard the door open and close. I didn't know what to do. 

After a few minutes in bed, I jumped up and ran down the hall, past our kitchen into the living room to our front door where I noticed that, not only was the front door closed, but the dead bolt was locked. Something no one could do unless they had a key to the deadbolt on the outside of the door, which only me and my wife have. I checked on Damon who was fast asleep and our little girl Kelsey who was 9 at the time and asleep too, and went back to our room and layed down, unable to sleep for a while later.

The next morning as I woke, the first thing I did was go out to the front door and double check again to make sure what happened last night was real. I walked to the front door when Kelsey came out of her room and I asked her if she experienced anything strange last night. She said ""No, but I was up when you went outside last night to let the dog out."" I asked her what time she said around 3:30am. I told her I didn't let the dog out and she said she saw a man walk out the house with a dog and assumed it was me taking the dog out. I was floored, not knowing what to make of that. 

When I went to work the next day, I told Kalvin about the things that happened to me the night before, and Kalvin was quick to tell me he heard his door open and close that night too and could have sworn he heard a man in his kitchen. After talking to him I realized the customer who was murdered was a big black man in his 30's who weighed about 300 pounds and always wore Timberland boots. I am convinced that it was the man who was murdered coming to me and Kalvin that night to let us know that it is not okay to talk the way we did about him and his wife or the situation of what happened to them.

Our family moved from that house a little over a year later but never had any other thing happen except one other night which I will write about in another story soon, as I am not completely convinced it was the same spirit as that night was. This was not the spookiest thing to ever happen to me but by far a very unsettling one. I never spoke or made light of what has happened to that couple the night they were murdered again, and I believe that was the only message he meant for me to realize.

I wish every time I think back to that night that I just turned my head to look at what was in the door of our bedroom that night, but I'm not sure how I would have seen the man. Would he look normal like when he was alive? Would he look as he did after the crime scene? Would he look even more scary on purpose to get a reaction out of me? I have no idea. It might be for the best that I didn't move and look as it happened, as it may have been a sight I would never forget. I believe I'm better off that I never looked over my shoulder at the man in the doorway."
"It Lurked In The Night","Pennsylvania","Haunted Places","This will be my first post EVER, regarding my personal experiences with the spiritual world. Only few know of this and the other stories I will tell in the future. 

** Please be advised that names will be changed in this story to protect the identities who wish not to be named ** 

Back in 2014 I lived in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. Renting a room in a Victorian mansion from two lovely people I knew very well and cared very deeply about. We will call these lovely people Piper and Stan. I lived there a separate time for 2 years alongside someone who was not good for me, I ended up moving back to New York City and decided to move back in 2014 alone. 

Never have I experienced anything out of the ordinary while living in this house, only a few times where I did laundry in the small laundry room next to the kitchen. I felt like someone was hovering over me and it felt pretty heavy but overall I decided to always ignore that. 

I worked a steady job, basically a 9-5 with only weekends off which didn't work in my favor because I never liked to go out and party on the weekends - except for this one weekend. 

I go out with my best friend who lives in Pennsylvania her name will be Cait. She was very shy and I was the outgoing expressive one, so we definitely had a balance and I made her be a little more outgoing. We go to this party she got invited to on a Saturday, we weren't feeling it too much so we decided to go home. 

She dropped me off at my house and I went through the back so I wouldn't disturb anyone sleeping by going through the front, it was about 2:30am. Going through the back meant either going straight up the stairs to the second floor (which is where my room was) or going through the kitchen, through the office, into the hall, and that's where the staircase was going to the second floor.

 So I went through the kitchen way so I could grab some snacks and 2 water bottles so I wouldn't have to come all the way back downstairs again. As I unlocked the kitchen door I jumped and froze right in my spot, fixated on the usual coat rack that is there next to the refrigerator. Now... The coat rack didn't make me freeze in fear but what I saw standing there. I saw a very heavy set man (I can only see the figure not the face, it was just a dark shadow) he was very wide and was bald. I only stood there for a few more seconds staring into a blank dark face trying to depict what I'm seeing and I'm very certain he was staring right back at me. Seconds later I turned on the light and he disappears. Leaving just the one thin windbreaker hanging where it always is... A windbreaker is definitely not wide enough to make a shadow that looks heavy set. - regardless, I tried my best to ignore the cold feeling I felt internally in me, you know that cold feeling you get when something scares you?

 I went forth and continued on to the laundry room into the office feeling an eerie presence lurking behind me but I just sped walk and sprinted upstairs and locked my door (as if that means anything.) I fell asleep instantly forgetting what had happened and now it's just a small memory but HERE is where things get really scary.

 We're going to fast forward a few months, I'd like to say about 5 months living there. It was pretty quiet after that incident with 'The heavyset man."" I didn't feel much after that except for the times I did laundry every week even during the day... That heavy lingered presence on my back.

 5 months after that night encountering 'him' my friend Cait lived with me. We shared my huge room on the second floor and it was perfect for us. Plus since she was a friend of mine Piper and Stan (the landlords) had no issue in us sharing a room (I was and am very trusting) things were normal with me and Cait with sharing a room except I was a clean freak and she wasn't and most of the time she wasn't really home since she was seeing a guy a few blocks away.

 Piper and Stan had a ton of animals. (I LOVED IT) 3 dogs, 3 cats, a cute parakeet. Sounds like a lot but the house was well big enough for every pet to run as free as it wanted. I'm a cat person so I always wanted the cats to be with me. Now telling the scariest night of my life that made me move away. 

I took one of the cats, Beau up to my room to sleep with me for the night. I was home alone - I believe Piper and Stan were working graveyard shifts at that time and Cait was at that boy's house. So here it was just me and Beau Beau laying down watching movies on my laptop. 

Let me quickly explain how the second floor layout is so you don't get confused during the story. There are 4 bedrooms up there. My landlords room was closest to the steps (Keep IN MIND that the stairs have a nightlight plugged in to light the stairs up at night which I can see the dim light under my door.), her daughter's room was to the left which contained a bathroom in that the people on the second floor would share. (Her daughter moved out) then there was my room which had a huge closet and a locked door that went into the bathroom of the daughter's room, and beside my room was a smaller bedroom which no one was living in at the time. I was the only one living on that floor besides my landlords and Cait. This night I was home alone for once. - back to the story - 

So I'm in bed watching a movie and the cat is sound asleep, Cait said she was coming back home so I was waiting up for her to chill. It became almost 3am when everything weird started to happen. That door I was talking about, the one that is locked from both sides that leads to the bathroom is where it all starts... Beau bolted her head up at the same time I turned my head at that door. I felt this figure that felt very dark and very heavy. I felt death was definitely behind that door. Me and Beau just keep looking toward that door and a few moments later I hear walking (when the house is quiet you can hear every sound on the carpet and hardwood floors. Every creak.) so I hear walking around in the bathroom like if someone was home but more like walking back and forth in the bathroom. My heart started to race and the cat clearly looks scared herself but she's not leaving my side or hiding away. A few seconds after that I hear the walking leave the bathroom and then continue on in my landlords daughters room. Walking around like it was their room, slow steps. After that, the slow steps start creeping out of the room I can hear the creaking of the wooden floors with every step and Beau's head was following every movement outside the door like she could see it through the door. This thing started to walk closer and closer to my door until finally it was in front of my door, I could hear slow deep breaths in front of my door and from my bed I looked to see if that dim light from the staircase was peeking through my door... It wasn't... It was complete blackness as if that light was never on (it's automatic it would've been impossible.) at that moment I started to lightly panic, wanting to cry but didn't because I felt it would be easier to capture me if I showed fear... I don't know, it was just my thought at the time... It stood in front of my door with the same deep breaths for what felt like a whole 5 minutes... It was probably 2 but the intensity made it seem like 5. My heart was racing and I didn't know what to do... 

After that the slow walking moved from my room to the smaller room next door to mine... What did I see? The dim light from the staircase underneath my door! There was something there! Standing there either waiting for me to come out or watching me through the cracks. Moments later I start to hear crashing and things being thrown in the other bedroom. I let out a small shriek since I wasn't expecting any of the loud clashing I heard.

 I texted my landlords asking if they were home and they told me they wouldn't be back until 8am so I texted Cait asking if she was coming home and she told me she was just going to stay at that boy's house. At this point the panic really started to set in. I called my friend from NYC we'll call him Token, telling him everything that had just happened and thankfully he believed me and told me to be calm and that he would stay on the phone with me until I fell asleep. I stayed up all night until the sun came up with my door locked as it was to begin with. I fell asleep around 7:45am. 

A knock on my door at 8:30am woke me up (I have not left my room since I entered it). It was Piper. She asked me if I had any people over last night and if they used the small room next to me. Confused and kind of dazed I say ""no? I was alone that's why I texted you I was hearing weird things"" she then tells me to look at the room and my mouth drops right open. The mattress was tossed over upside down on the floor alongside the foam that was on top of it, there was cotton from the pillows all over the carpet, and scratches on the black wooden dresser that was never there. I swore up and down that I don't know what happened and was completely stunned by it because that means I wasn't dreaming or imagining things. That all actually happened. As much I loved my landlords and they loved me I couldn't explain to her what happened to me that night or even said anything about it to her at all. I felt she wouldn't believe me as much as I knew she would, or I would be looked at as crazy. 

This was the worst night I ever had to live on my own. The rest of my stories will be scary but not as bad as this one since other times I had the option to leave. Feel free to leave any comments or questions... Hope you enjoyed reading; it was not fun to relive that typing it all in full detail. 

Have a blessed day.

"Can Anyone Explain Any Of This?","Texas","Haunted Places","My father passed away in February, 2014. We had a memorial service in his home in Helotes, TX, in which I was living, in May of that year. Strange things started happening immediately after the memorial. This story will contain highlights. All of these are true and completely unexplained events. They all happened within about 10 months after dad's memorial.

A few mornings after the memorial my sister woke up and found about ¼ cup of uncooked white rice under her pillow. It was not there when she went to sleep. She had slept in my dad's bed in his room. The same day my sister found the rice my brother, Matt, found about 1/2 cup of uncooked white rice inside his acoustic guitar that was in a closed and latched guitar case. He had played it the evening before and the rice was not there.

A few weeks later I found a pile of sand outside a large, metal storage shed on the property the house sits on. It is on 4 acres and is somewhat rural. The sand pile was symmetrical and looked to have been poured out of a bag. Opening the large, swinging door of the shed I found some sand inside as if the sand had been poured from inside the door. I was the only person living on the property and had had no guests since the memorial. Matt and I had gone through the shed looking for anything of value right after dad's memorial. I called my brother to ask about the sand pile and he had no idea what I was talking about.

A few weeks after that I found flax seeds scattered on the kitchen floor. My late mother had kept flax seeds in a sealed plastic bag on a small cart in the kitchen for years. The bag had not been touched in probably 4 years. I thought mice had gotten in the bag and picked it up to throw it away and it was still sealed. I went upstairs, showered and picked up a shirt I had laid out the night before. About half a cup of flax seeds dumped out of the shirt.

I started finding blue popcorn seeds around the house. Not a lot, but I found them on the carpet, on counter tops and in a folded bathroom towel. My mother had kept a jar of blue popcorn seeds in the pantry for years, but there had not been any in the house for probably 6-8 years.

I also started finding Pride of Barbados seeds around the house - under blankets in beds, on counters, on the fireplace hearth and quietly in a downstairs room one day and heard what sounded like a body falling upstairs - I have heard the sound before, but not in this house. I rushed upstairs and found nothing out of place.

I was in that same room reading the following week and heard what sounded like 5 knocks on a wall. I looked all over the house and outside and there was nobody around besides me. I started knocking on walls and figured out that the knocks sounded just like my knocking on a sheetrock wall.

One day while working in the kitchen I heard a door slam in my father's room. His room is right off the kitchen/living room area. I rushed into the bedroom and found all doors to closets and the bathrooms wide open.

I went downstairs the next week and found a wooden fish that my brother had made as a kid on the dining room floor. It had been set on a shelf above a kitchen counter that held decorations many years ago. In front of the fish, which was about 3 feet long and 18 inches wide, on the shelf was an old lunch box and a stick with twine wound around it. The fish had somehow fallen off the shelf without disturbing either item. I put the fish back and did everything I could to try to make it fall. I jumped up and down, banged the shelf, slammed doors and could not make the fish move. The very next day I was I the kitchen. I started walking up the stairs from the dining area and heard a loud crashing sound. The fish was once again on the floor. Neither the lunch box or the twine had been disturbed, which was very strange because they should have been knocked over when the fish fell.

After all of this things settled down for several months. My brother visited again in December of 2014. We were sitting upstairs watching a San Antonio Spurs basketball game on TV on Christmas evening. The game ended around 9:00 pm. I turned the TV off and we sat in silence for a moment. We suddenly heard five knocks on a wall. Matt turned to me with a startled look on his face and asked if I had heard the knocks. I told him I did. We looked all over the house and outside and there was nobody else around.

By the way, the knocks had never been heard before and have not been heard since. There is no boiler, water heater or other mechanical source we could think of that could have made the knocking sound. Also, Matt and I are two of 5 siblings and each time there were 5 knocks.

All of these things except the final knocking happened when I was the only person in the house or on the property. I had no guests until my brother's visit since my dad's memorial service. Nobody had been in the house or on the property since the memorial.

The house has been sold and as far as I know nothing strange has happened since the December, 2014 knocks."
"White Demon","Alabama","Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms","I have put in a few stories regarding the paranormal experiences I have been having, all connected, might I include. I've been told that I've been haunted by a negative entity and for so long I believed it because that is what paranormal investigators told me.

My gifted friend, who I trust with my life, has been there through most of my terrible experiences. She helped me get rid of the being and shielded it away from me.

I actually just recently learned she has shielded it into a ball so it couldn't get out and affect my life even more. She has told me it keeps ""scratching to get out"" which always sends shivers down my spine every time I think about it.

For a long time she has lied to me about what it was. And recently, she told me she lied and said it was a demon. When I saw it for the first and only time, it was white. And she told me she has never seen a white demon before and I never heard of such a thing. I tried looking it up and got some answers but not sure if they're true.

From what I've read it said, ""A white demon is refered to a low leveled demon. A demon so low that it can't gain entry into Hell itself. ""

I keep fearing that it will come back and she, my gifted friend, keeps warning me not to fear it. To be brave. She also told me if it ever got out, which it almost did at one point, that it'll start harming anyone who gets in its way. And that when it gets out, it'll go after my son to get to me. I was so angry at that point. Because not only is it trying to affect me, it'll affect my son and that's the last thing I want.

She has said it loved me in my past life and I wonder what did I do in my past life for it to love me? What is it? Why me? Who was I in my past life and how could I ever find out?"
"Attacked By A Poltergeist","Pennsylvania","Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations","It was March 18, 2016 2:15 a.m. I could not forget this date and time if I tried. It was a normal night until I attempted to read the tarot cards. As I centered myself and channeled energy from all around me I was suddenly filled with dread like I have never felt. It started in the base of my neck and seem to flood in to me completely. 

Ignoring it I reached for the cards and was actually shocked by them. Thinking I was just too upset to read them I turned to music but it did not make me feel like I usually did. It was a very short time later there was a whisper in my ear telling me ""You know what this is.""

I instantly grabbed my athame and channeled all the energy I could shoving down the blade to the floor as I did to my left rose up the darkest figure I have ever seen in my life. It actually blocked the mirror behind it stopping the reflection from the lamp at the other end of the hall. Absolute terror filled me I have had run-ins with spirits before but not like this. If felt like pure evil. 

I did the first think that came to mind as it bolted so fast you could barely follow it to the back of the house. I lit the white sage, I live in a trailer so I cleansed the front rooms and started down the hall I had to get to my 13 year old in the next room. As soon as I opened the door he jumped to his feet and began to panic. He could actual feel the evil from this thing. 

Giving him the athame as I continued casting the spell we worked our way back there was still no reflection in the mirror. Having this thing cornered we continued trying to fight it. My son placed his hand upon my shoulder pushing me all the energy he could to help. 

Never in my entire life have I seen something black twist and contort like it did I could not forget this if I had to and I wish I could. I looked back at the sudden surge of energy to find my Grandfather whom I have never met standing behind my son with his hand upon his shoulder as well. I could see him plain as day yet through him at the same time. 

Turning back and completing the spell it twisted with its mouth open in a silent scream, I am so glad I could not hear it, and sank in the floor.

 I cleansed the house three times over the next few days and was scared to death to try to channel again. 

Does anyone know what this thing was? I truly pray that no one has to face anything like this I cannot explain the depth of pure evil that came off of this thing. I have since moved out of that house."
"I Think My House Is Haunted, I Don't Know What To Do Anymore","Arizona","Haunted Places","I think that my house has spirits or demons, whatever you want to call them but, ever since I moved in I've seen things looking at me through my door way (when there was no possible way it could've been a shadow) they were pretty detailed. I'm always seeing dark figures walk towards and away from me and every time they do I get this incredible fear and I don't even know why, I wasn't scared at all I just thought it was me.

Once they walk away I'm completely fine but now I'm terrified because of what just happen.

The reason I'm actually on this site is because I heard really heavy breathing across my room so I held my breath and there was no one and nothing else in my room, once I turned the lights on it stopped.

I came back on here today because I honestly don't know what to do anymore... Every night I made sure my closet door is closed and then I wake up in the middle of the night randomly really late and it's cracked open... (just enough for something to look through and it's a sliding door) nothings pushing on it and there's no possibility for it to open on its own like that, so I guess I'm just on here seeing if anyone else has experienced this or any of this.

Some other things I've experienced

Glowing small eyes looking and blinking at me

Seeing shadows/figures looking at me through my window whenever I have it open

Things crawling on my ceiling 

Things looking at me through every door in my house

Figures walking down the hall towards my room

 (I know most of these things are just me probably being paranoid and I'm sorry._.)"
"The Little Blue Man?","Maryland","Non Human Entities","I recently started on a painting to hang over my bed not too long ago of a little blue fairy. My mother, when she saw what I was painting, asked me what I was working on. When I said that it was a fairy she told me it had reminded her of the tiny blue creature she had seen while she was pregnant with me (that the only difference was that it was a male). I vaguely remembered her telling me about it, but I asked her to tell me about it again anyway. 

""It was little and blue. It kind of reminded me of a troll, and it just touched my pregnant belly and smiled. I did not feel like it was going to hurt me,"" she had said, and then proceeded to tell me that it had pointy teeth. My friends and I have talked about it in length because we've all had our own paranormal experiences; one of our group of three being more knowledgeable than myself or the second party. We all speculate that it is more than likely one of the nice people, but we aren't entirely certain.

Despite various searches 'small blue creatures with pointy teeth', 'blue imps with pointy teeth' or even 'imps with pointy teeth' I have not been able to find any information on this creature. I want to say that it is an imp, not a troll, but whenever I draw one of the nice people it always comes back to this specific design. I also see them quite erratically in my dreams being playful and not particularly harmful (part of the reason I want to call them imps); I would love to know if anyone else has had any experiences with these creatures, or if they have any information on them. They may not seem harmful, but not knowing what they are is a little unsettling given a very recent spike in issues with sleep paralysis."
"This Story Is Currently Happening Right Now: Shadow Person?","Michigan","Shadow People","I moved into this house about a year ago. Two weeks after moving in I was in the basement doing laundry when I saw something in the corner on the other side of the room it kind of look like a face. I freaked out and called my boyfriend he told me it was all in my head. 

 After about a week I started wondering if maybe I was crazy and I mistook what I saw. To this day I keep a light on in the basement at all times because I'm scared to go down there in the dark. 

 Fast forward to about the beginning of the summer. I was up really late like 1 or 2 am. I was upstairs sitting on my bed trying to go to sleep when there is this super loud caboom. The bed vibrated and everything. The sound came from living room, it sounded like someone kicked in my door. I was freaking so bad I called the cops. They came and looked around and nothing was out of place. 

 Ok I really must be going crazy now. No one is believing me. My boyfriend wasn't home because he works nights. He kept telling me I was crazy so I just left well enough alone and didn't speak about it again. 

 About a month later my 8 year old daughter is freaking one morning something about seeing some kind of shadow person when she woke up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night. I didn't think anything about it. I told her it must have been her imagination and that was the last thing that what said about it. 

 Until 2 nights ago. I decided to google it and read all about it. That night all was quiet in the house the kids were sleeping and I'm laying in bed when I start to hear noises from downstairs. It sounded like someone was like I don't know, scuffing their feet real hard on the carpet while walking around. I went down and investigated thinking one of the kids were up but everyone was sleeping so I went to bed. 

 The next morning before school I got my 8 year old up a little early and asked her some questions about the shadow person. I had her explain to me what she saw. She said it had no face, and it was black, looked like a person, and was really super tall. She said it was just standing at the bottom of the stairs looking at her. 

 She goes and gets ready for school. I wake up her 9 year old sister and the first words out of her mouth are ""why were you standing in my door in the dark just watching me sleep?"" I'm like I wasn't. I had no part in that. Does anyone know how to get rid of this thing? My kids are scared and I don't have the funds to move right now."
"A Few Weird Happenings","Florida","Haunted Places","I am not sure what's going on but a few weird things have happened to me in the last few days and my husband was with me when all of this happened. 

My husband and I were in our bed room and it was night time, it was really really dark in our bed room and we both heard music play but only for a second. I was like did you hear that and he is like yeah I did, and we both were creeped out but we think it's interesting too. Then a few minutes after we heard the music, my husband and I see fog all over our room. It lasted about ten minutes and then it was gone. 

Then, this morning I hear a man's voice but it was soft and I couldn't understand what he said.

 The morning goes by and me and my husband hear the doorbell rings and my husband answers. An old lady is at the door and she asks for me by name and says that we have met before, I can hear her from my bed room. My husband calls me name and I come out and I see her and my husband goes into our bed room but he said he was listening to what we were talking about which I am glad he did.

 The lady doesn't say her name all she says that she would like to read a little bit of the Bible with me, and asks if it's ok with me. I say sure. The lady and I read a little bit and then my husband comes out of our bed room and when he does that she leaves. She quickly but very nicely leaves. I NEVER met this old lady in my life, how did she know my name and where I live for that matter? My husband has never met her as well so we both are not sure what's going on."
"Apparition Watching Me?","Alabama","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","One evening around 11pm in November of 2016, I was hard at work in my recording studio, located in the basement of my house in Huntsville, Alabama.

I was working on a mix session of a recording I'd produced earlier in the month for a band from the area. I'd briefly gone upstairs to make myself a drink for a final listen to the tune I'd been working on. My wife was upstairs watching television and I'd told her that I was almost finished with work for the day.

I went back down to my control room, just off the soundproof music studio, to take a final listen before I made a final mix of the song, and then I decided to step outside to clear my head and get some fresh air.

To get outside, I had to walk out of the studio out a doorway, through my 2-car garage, and out another door which opened onto my side driveway. 

As I was coming out to the side driveway, I decided to glance at my iPhone, specifically my Facebook page, which I used for my studio business. Seeing there was no activity that I needed to respond to, I clicked the ""lock"" button and put the phone into my back pocket.

My side driveway is roughly the width of two cars, and beyond the driveway is a side yard around 15 yards wide, with a couple of very tall pine trees. At the edge of the yard is a heavily wooded and rocky area which leads down into a a city-owned drainage ditch.

On the other side of the ditch is another heavily wooded and rocky area, on a steep hill, and then another house which is mostly obscured by trees and heavy underbrush. That house sits on a different street which backs up to the cul-de-sac on which I live.

It was chilly outside, but no wind blew. Typical Fall night in Northern Alabama for that time of year. It was approaching 11pm on a weeknight, and the quiet neighborhood seemed even quieter than normal.

I looked around the area directly across from me and saw that there were no lights on in the house across the ditch from me, 50 yards away. In fact, the only light visible in the whole area was a streetlight located in the back of our cul-de-sac, about 75 yards to my right.

All of a sudden, things became VERY quiet. The crickets and bugs had stopped chirping, the night birds had gone silent, and the low-key noise of a suburban neighborhood had entirely ceased. Very strange since usually one would hear a neighbor's air-conditioning unit or a lone dog barking in the distance. Even the traffic sounds from a heavily traveled thoroughfare around 10 blocks away had gone silent. Immediately the hair on my arms raised, and I felt a chill. 

I scanned my heavily wooded backyard to my left and saw and heard nothing. When I looked back across my side yard, I couldn't believe what I was seeing.

Hovering above a flat rock about 15 yards from me was a smoky-white apparition with a white glow, around 12 feet in height, shaped like an enormous mummy. The apparition had the clear shape of a head, shoulders, arms and legs, but no ""feet"" were visible.

I could barely make out the shapes of trees through the apparition, so in a split second, my rational mind attempted to make sense of the apparition by thinking it was simply a small patch of fog. But this ""fog"" was clearly in the shape of an enormous man, like an outline of what we'd commonly think of when we visualize a mummy. 

I literally wiped my eyes, and looked again, and the apparition was still there, and I got the overwhelming feeling that I was being watched and observed. (I had seen and heard things around my house and yard before in the six years I'd lived here, but nothing as distinct and intimidating as this.) 

While watching the apparition, I reached into my back pocket and called my wife, who was still upstairs, and asked her to come out the front door and around to the side yard, and to bring a flashlight we keep handy in our TV room, telling her I had seen something that I wanted her to see. 

So, thinking quickly, I thought to actually verbally address the apparition. I said, out loud, ""Hey, it's okay that you are here. We don't want to hurt you, nor do we want you to hurt us. We just want to know who you are."" And with that, I switched on the flashlight function of my phone, and slowly walked toward the apparition, who remained in the same spot as when I first saw it. I got within about 10 yards from the apparition, and I was able to get a better look at it. 

The thing was floating a couple feet above the flat rock below, and I saw no sources of light for the apparition. I looked left and right and saw no sources of light from either side, or anything from above it, or any stray light from neighboring houses. The thing just glowed dimly white.

I took a couple more steps, saying to the entity, ""It's okay that you are here, I don't want to harm you, and I don't want to be harmed."" With my third step or so, I watched as the apparition began to descend slowly down into the rock it was perched above. It literally just folded itself down until it was completely gone.

Just as it disappeared, my wife came around the corner of our house with the flashlight on, asking me what she was supposed to be looking for. I told her briefly what I'd seen, and I grabbed the flashlight and went over to the rock where I'd seen the apparition. Nothing remained, and the area was pitch-dark. 

About that time, the noise from the crickets and bugs returned, a dog barked in the distance, and I began to hear noise from the main road several blocks from our house. It was as if something had flipped a switch and suddenly the world of that neighborhood was audible again.

I'd made a mental note while observing the apparition about its height and width, using nearby trees as a guide. The next morning, I was still a bit shaken, so I took a construction-grade tape measure from my tool box and made some rough measurements of the relative size of apparition. I came up with figures of around 12 feet tall and nearly four feet wide. 

On reflection, the apparition looked to be in perfect proportion to a large mummy, but made of milky white fog or smoke which seemed to ""move"" inside of the outer shape. I got the overwhelming feeling of being watched, but strangely, I felt nothing negative or antagonistic about the apparition. I just felt like it was watching me. Now I wished that I'd stayed still and not approached it, so that my wife would have also possibly been able to observe it.

The land on which my house sits was undoubtedly Indian land at some point, as our land backs up to a low-lying city park that looks as it had been a shallow lake in the last 200 years. To that end, I wonder if the apparition had been some sort of a spirit of one of the former residents of the land?

Anyone have any clues as to what I observed?

Thanks for reading, and I'd appreciate hearing your thoughts and theories, and welcome your questions."
"Heaving Breathing Spirit?","Virginia","Haunted Places","Just some information about me for contextual purposes: I am a college student in Virginia and I regularly work odd locations during the summers to pay for tuition. Last summer, the summer of 2017, I was living in Danville, VA but working in Richmond, VA (about 3 hours driving distance between the two). When I would be working in Richmond, VA, I would stay with my aunt and her family in their house. Just for context: my aunt lives in a brand new house (they are the first ones living there) in the suburbs with her husband, toddler, and Boston Terrier. My house is a small, also new two-story rental that shares no walls with any other building, and I live alone. There were about 6 (2 at my aunt's house, 4 at home) experiences total that I had that summer, although I'm still not sure which ones were paranormal, and which were coincidental and could have been caused by something else.

My first experience: 

Early on in the summer, I was sleeping in my aunt's finished attic space (typically used as an entertainment area/man cave). She has a guest bedroom that I normally would use, but my grandma and grandpa were visiting her on this occasion as well, so I slept on the couch in the attic room. I don't consider myself an extremely light sleeper, but it's not unusual for louder sounds to wake me up. I was falling asleep on the couch, laying on my stomach. But, just as I was falling asleep (I think it must've been around 11:30 am), I heard a deep, heavy breathing. Because I was just on the cusp of waking up, it took my a few seconds to realize that it wasn't a part of my dream. I laid on the couch with my eyes closed, holding my breath, just listening for about 20 seconds. When I realized that I couldn't come up with a good explanation, I opened my eyes, and immediately it stopped. I was a bit freaked out, but since it stopped when I opened my eyes, I convinced myself that it must've been a weird dream state I was in. I went back to sleep, thought about it for a bit the next morning and then forgot about it.

My second experience:

Like I said, I had completely forgotten about the first incident at my aunt's house, it wasn't until this next incident that I was truly suspicious. It was much later in the summer, several weeks had passed, and several uneventful nights had gone by at my aunt's house. This particular night, I went to bed in the guest room as usual around 12:30, and there was nothing odd about the room or the conditions besides the fact that there were songbirds singing outside my window as they had been for the past couple nights (I looked into this, and I believe it was as a result of mating?). I fell asleep soundly soon after the songbirds stopped singing. At around 4 am (guessing because there was some time between when I woke up and when I checked my clock), I was woken up to that same sound of deep, heavy breathing. I instantly recognized it. So, I did the same thing. I kept my eyes shut, held my breath, and listened. I listened quietly for about 60 seconds, long enough to have located the area that I thought the noise was coming from. During this time, I also ticked off all of the possible things that could be causing it. After knowing it wasn't me breathing, I cracked my eyes open the smallest amount (I have this weird, childish idea that scary things won't try to hurt me if they don't know I've seen them), but when I looked around and saw absolutely nothing except for the empty space from which the breathing was still coming, it terrified me. After that, my eyes shot wide open, and the breathing instantly stopped. It's like whatever was making that noise didn't want me to hear, so it only stopped when it saw I was awake. After that, I turned my lamp on, checked the time, and watched The Office on my phone until I felt comfortable enough to fall asleep. I did sleep with the lights on for the rest of the summer while I stayed at my aunt's house.

I think it's important to mention here that these were the only two experiences that happened at my aunt's house, and while there was a decent time gap between the first two experiences, the events that happened in my own home happened almost all right after the second experience and at least once a week following.

The TV at my house:

This one is less exciting, and falls more under the category of ""things that could be coincidental and explained away."" At my house, the setup is bedroom and bathroom downstairs, living room and kitchen on the main floor, and a lofted area on top. The set up is that of a townhouse, but only an individual townhouse, my building does not share any walls and is not near any neighbors. This is a smaller event that went on for several weeks. I do watch TV quite a bit as I live alone, so that's why this one may be easier to explain away, but there were always some things that didn't sit quite right, timing being the primary thing. Once a week for about 4 or 5 weeks, the TV would turn on by itself, at about 3 times the volume that I would ever have put it on, enough to startle me away from the floor below. It was always this loud, it always occurred around 3 am, but never occurred on the same day of the week. I talked to my stepdad about this, and he suggested that maybe I was setting my TV to turn on at a certain time on accident, by sitting on the remote or something. That was good enough for me at first, but then after I was conscientious about not sitting on the remote, it still continued to happen. Not to mention, I had been living in this house with the same couch, TV, and remote for over a year, and this had never happened. The first time it happened, American Psycho was playing on TV which honestly scared the absolute crap out of me, but every other time it was just like a Mucinex ad or something random, so I'm very glad it wasn't a horror movie every time. 

The running:

This was truthfully, the most terrifying paranormal experience I've had. To many of you, it may not seem wildly scary, but as a young college girl living alone in a city, it was truly terrifying. I was at my house, asleep in my bed when I slowly began to wake up. My first thought was ""Great, what is it this time? Breathing or TV?"" (this occurred right after the TV-turning-on-by-itself debacle). But as I came to, I realized that it was neither. It was heavy footsteps, running back and forth, on the floor above my head. So, let me give you some further context into the setup on my house. The floor plan is pretty perfectly square, and the stairs are all the way on the left side of the house, attached to the outer wall. The head of my bed is centered right against the outer right wall, and on the floor above me, the couch is centered right against the same wall. So, the area that the running came from was absolutely occupied by a piece of heavy furniture. I sat aware for at least an hour, just listening to the running go back and forth. I refused to investigate. Sometimes I wish I had gone to investigate just to see, maybe there'd be some good explanation that could ease my mind. But instead, I sat up in my bed, with all the lights on, curled up in all of my bedsheets. I thought it was maybe an animal, but there's just no way. It's a newly developed house, and I've never found so much as a mouse in there. And there's no way that sound was coming from anything less than something the size of a fully grown man. I eventually laid back down, terrified, and tried to clock it out until I successfully went to sleep. The next morning, I set a glue trap under the couch. If an animal was having that much fun running around last night, surely it'd come back. The glue trap is still there, and still hasn't moved an inch.

The footsteps were the last straw for me. I ran to my nearest health food store, grabbed a bundle of sage, and brought it home. I openly said that whatever it was needed to move on and stop scaring me, or I would burn the sage. Not sure if this was the right thing to do, but its over a year later, and nothing more has happened. Interested to hear what you guys think. Thanks!"
"Weird As Heck Visitation?","Idaho","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","Back in the day, my two oldest brothers and I rented a flat in Boise that was the top floor of an older house, above the neighbor, Laney. The house was connected to a mineral spring for hot water and heat. It was usually hot enough on our floor that the windows all fogged, since Laney set the temperature on the radiators from her place on the ground floor. We had a few strange things happen at that address, but the weirdest couldn't be explained as ghosts. So far, it has not been explained at all.

For a time I was seeing a fella named ""Mikel"". He was a solid, kind soul, very practical and not given to boasting or exaggeration. Even before we took up he had been to our place often enough, as he was friends with my brothers. Which is to say, my brothers had no objections to me dating him.

One spring night, pretty late, we lay down very conventionally to sleep with my head sideways on his right arm, and him laying on his back in a queen bed on a box spring on the the floor (or about 2 ½ feet off the floor). Past the foot of the bed, the door to my room and all the windows were shut as it very cold still outside. As usual though, it was muggy hot, from the radiators we couldn't turn down. 

As I was drifting off, I heard a ""Shiii-iiiiink"" sort of noise (like in the movies when a sword comes out of the scabbard) and felt a very cold draft. Without opening my eyes I could see, shining at the foot of my bed, two figures, sort of outlined, but in different types of light. 

To make this vanish, I lifted my head and opened my eyes. But there in goldish green light at the foot of my bed was an adult sized figure in a cloak, with a headband, holding a staff or something to his shoulder, sort of leaning toward a smaller figure outlined in blue light. This one's face was scrunched and wrinkled, and he stood hunched, but long-limbed, like a fairytale dwarf or gnome, just a half foot or so taller than the bed. 

Although my brain was rebelling my eyes saw this as plain as day, my hand to any God you choose. It, the dwarf size thing was staring straight at me, sort of grinning like it was waiting for me to holler. The metallic ""shiiiink"" sounded again and nothing was there. This was all in maybe ten seconds of time.

I put my head back on his arm, and asked Mikel, ""did you hear that?"", not wanting to scare him, or him to think I am loony. And he says to me in answer ""did you see the dwarf?""

I did not know what to think. As real as they seemed, I was counting on a denial from him to make it ""all in my head."" How could he have seen that too?

Ridiculously, I asked him ""were your eyes open or closed?""

He said ""I don't think that was real."" His heart was beating very fast.

I said "" I think we should just close our eyes."" It was a mind warp and felt better to act like all was normal, and try to sleep. I was surprised that I was so calm, but sleeping seemed most reasonable. I have always been the type to react or panic a long time after any emergency or danger has passed.

We did, sort of jokingly, tell people the next day. They just raised their eyebrows and shrugged. I am pretty sure they thought we were making it up. Weird as it was, I heard what I heard, and saw what I saw. So did Mikel, but if he wasn't going to bring it up after that, neither was I. We didn't really know what to think. After I moved out of state we lost touch. I don't usually share this story because it makes no sense and people always act like I am messing with them. Why would I make myself out to be a dwarf-hallucinating lunatic?

I have zero explanation for this event, and except Mikel ""seeing"" it too, don't really have proof. Honestly, if he hadn't been there and reacted, I would probably hope this was an unusually disturbing and very real half-sleep dream. Um, with sound and light effects. Nothing like this has happened to me before or since.

But, this happened and I have no idea what it was or could be. How could two people hallucinate or project the exact same vision and sound, and why a ""dwarf""? Not like a human with dwarfism but a fairytale gnomey-type dwarf? I am not saying that dwarves never existed, just questioning the possibility of one glowing in my bedroom in Idaho, to be seen by two people. This was 1997 or 98, before laser Christmas and Halloween projectors were available on the home market, and in any case the room was shut up and dark.

This story sounds a bit crazy written down- I can say that, since it is my story. Although I have gratefully read one similar experience on YGS (from the Middle East) which made me feel much better; even on this very open-minded site, sharing feels a little shy and silly. Maybe you readers can help me find more similar experiences. I want to share, in the name of honesty and exploration, but it is okay if no one else knows what to think of this experience. It is not ghostly or alien, I don't think, just weird as heck. When I think about it, I go back and forth between wanting an explanation and wishing it hadn't happened twenty years ago. Nothing I have researched explains all of it, or the dwarf, or the weird sound."
"Do You Mind If I Sit With You?","Massachusetts","Family / Friends Visits","I am Brian, msforgetmenott's Son.

 As many of you know she is hospitalized for an extended stay for a serious ovarian cancer surgery. As the day approached for this surgery, it became very hard for us as when ever in conversation with my Mom, she would mention some family item that we must take home. You see she believed she would not survive this surgery. She continually expressed it. She had been passing to us many of her Dad's family items that she had collected in 1999, when my Grandfather had died. During the Christmas holidays, or perhaps a Birthday, old things of value, inside new packaging. I have a powder horn made from an ox horn, that belonged to my Great, Great Grandfather. But that is another story for another day.

Our Family is small, only my Parents, I and my wife and our Daughter, almost 14 now. It is a far cry from those days when families had ten children each and their children had as many again each.

Early in the morning of my mother's surgery, we were able to sit in a room where in front of us was a screen, where we could follow the progression of my Mom's surgery. We shared this room with others, waiting for their loved one's surgery to be completed also, their eyes on the screen, with tensions high. One of us would get up and bring back coffee and such, we all knew we had a long wait.

On a trip from that room to the bathroom, I saw a beautiful well designed garden, just outside the big windows. Unusual trees and flowering plants. I stepped out, learning from the sign that this was a public healing garden. After several hours, being inside, the air was fresh and there were many songbirds to hear. Pretty paths with benches set in the shade. It was what my heart needed, and I sat, alone and I cried. I cried for myself, my Mom, and all who love her. 

I felt something on my back, then heard as slow male voice saying, ""do you mind if I sit with you?"" Shaking my lowered head no, I felt a person add weight to the bench, and putting a large hand on my knee. I turned to see, thinking it was a minister or priest, but saw no one. Yet, I still felt the large hand on my knee. My mind was swirling in confusion, but I knew who was beside me, my Grandfather, the only one with hands that large. The same hand I held as he took his last breath, with my Mom holding the other hand.

My Grampa, without doubt. You see for nearly 90 years those hands milked by hand, cut logs, worked farm machinery, held the reins of a workhorse and so very much more. I watched those hands gently pick an apple from the tree and plant tiny seeds in his wonderfully productive garden. ""We are here for you Son, and your Mother"" I lifted my head and for a brief moment I saw all an enormous mass of men and women, standing in masses, blocking out every flower and tree. Then they were gone, as was my Grampa. 

I stood, my tears dried and with a lighter step, walked back to the room. I no longer thought that we would lose my Mom. She was going to be fine.

"Evp Session","Ohio","Photographs / Videos / EVP","Since 9/11 I have been one of those that seek the truth on what really happened that day. I am always looking for any new information on the subject and watched pretty much all the videos out there on 9/11. So, last night, I have a ghost app downloaded on my phone that speaks words as energy from the other side come through. Well being the curious person I am, I started the app and wondered what would happen if I played a audio of some of the calls from the towers that day while I had the app running and this is what came through. 

 I asked if anyone was around that was in the towers on 9/11 and the names Danny, Drew, Thomas, Jeff came through one after another. Usually there are other words that come in between names but, all the names came through one after another and pretty fast also considering this app doesn't say words that fast. Then the name Thomas came through again with the words hurry and fire after his name. After a few seconds of the last words coming through, the name Jeff came through again and the words thick, smoke, lift, chest and pile came after his name. I at this point was very freaked out.

 Even though I am the type of person that gets into the more morbid side of certain things that might happen. I put on another audio of 9/11 and the words thick, smoke, and rise came out next. It was a minute or two after those words that the words tower, falling came out. After this, I started feeling very very dizzy and sick to my stomach stopping the video and app. My kitchen felt like there where hundreds of people in it with me. 9/11 was a devastating day in our country and my thoughts and prayers still to this day go out to everyone that lost someone that day."
"A Haunting In Fredericksburg","Virginia","Haunted Places","My son (Cooper) and I enjoy visiting Civil War battle sites. We just returned from Fredericksburg, Manassas and Antietam. This represents our third year of visiting such sites. In the past, we visited Gettysburg, Cold Harbour, Sailor's Creek, Civil War Museum in Harrisburg, Petersburg, etc. The term we use for these entertaining and educative ventures is ""edutainment"". 

Two years ago, my son experienced an unnatural occurrence while visiting the Sailor's Creek Battle Site Center. For your hungry eyes, please see the following details:

A Spectral Encounter 

Of all the battle sites we visited in December 2015, the Sailor's Creek, Virginia visiting centre was the last one. Sailor's Creek represented the undoing of the Confederacy Army. The Confederates lost one-third of their remaining army there. 

Anyway, Cooper and I entered the battle site visiting centre and there was a bus load of people inside viewing the various exhibits. After a short period of time, the bus left and took the visitors away. As a result, Cooper and I were the only ones left viewing the exhibits. 

When viewing Civil War exhibits, I take my sweet time; whereas my 15 year old impatient son literally whips through the exhibit displays. 

After an hour of viewing the exhibits, Cooper approaches me and inquires as to when we can leave. I assured Cooper that just 15 more minutes was needed to complete the exhibit cycle. Cooper said okay and returned to where he was seated. 

The padded bench that Cooper was sitting at was a tight squeeze for two people and the bench was facing a video monitor that wasn't working. 

Within ten minutes of returning back to the bench, Cooper hurriedly came up to me and stated, ""Dad, we have to go now!"" I replied with, ""Just 5 more minutes, Coops."" Cooper snapped back with, ""No, dad, now!"" 

While running out of the battle site centre, I asked Cooper what happened. Coops said, ""I'll tell you in the car."" Once we were in the car driving away, Cooper explained the following to me:

 When you said 15 more minutes, I returned to the small bench.

 While waiting for you, I was thinking about the video game ""Call of Duty"" and various ways that I can play this game better.

 After 5 minutes of thinking about Call of Duty, I heard some footsteps walk up to me. Thinking it was you, I turned, but no one was there.

 I thought that I was just hearing things so I returned back to my thoughts of Call of Duty.

 5 minutes after hearing the footsteps, I then heard, ""Move over."" And no one was there. 

 That's when I bolted over to see you again.

Cooper was quite spooked and didn't want to discuss this experience much. However, I did ask him the following, ""What kind of male voice did you hear?"" ""Did the voice have a distinct accent; was it deep, regular or high-pitched?"" Cooper explained that it wasn't a man's voice, it was a woman. 

Astonished, I probed, ""Nearly 20, 000 soldiers lost their lives at Sailor's Creek, are you sure it wasn't a man with a soprano voice?"" Cooper's deadpanned response was as follows, ""Not only was it a woman's voice, but I sensed her."" Cooper then said to me that he felt that the lady was really nice (?). I asked my son how he knew that the female apparition was nice and Cooper responded by saying that he sensed this as well.

We are not alone.

Eventually, Cooper got over this strange encounter and would discuss it with me more readily. With this in mind, I asked Cooper this year (2018) if he would mind staying for three nights at a Fredericksburg Bed & Breakfast (Richard Johnston Inn) that's allegedly haunted. Cooper was game and inquired as to why the Inn is haunted. 

What we learned is that the Richard Johnston Inn has three unearthly inhabitants. One of which is a Confederate Sharpshooter by the name of Private Ron who was shot by Union troops in the upper bedroom window. The second non-paying tenant is a black slave by the name of Toby. Toby was hung by the neck on a front yard tree for stealing a side of bacon. The third apparition is a little 4 to 5 year old unnamed girl. The little girl was brought to the Inn by her mother from a rural area so that the town doctor could administer to the girl's ill-health. Obviously, the doctor was unsuccessful at saving the little girl and she died in the Inn. 

We further learned that Private Ron likes to make appearances in the Inn's kitchen (must be a foodie). Toby's passion is to playfully move the silverware around on the dining room table. Apparently, Toby didn't take his untimely death personally. As for the little girl, guests have heard her lively footsteps scampering throughout the Inn.

Upon enduring three airplane flights and a one and half hour rental car trip from the Washington DC airport to Fredericksburg, Cooper and I arrived to the Richard Johnston Inn at 1am on Tuesday, March 27, 2018.

Isabella's Suite at the Inn was magnificently spacious, adorned with eighteen century furniture, art and fixtures that were augmented by modern day conveniences (Wi-Fi, two televisions, telephone, mini-fridge, wet bar and a coffee maker). Quite simply, the suite was beyond ideal.

With casual thoughts of the Inn's three spiritual forms, Cooper hopped into his Queen bed and I retired to my Queen bed at approximately 1:45am. Because of the extensiveness of that day's journey, I was extremely tired. However, sleep didn't come easily as my mind was still racing with thoughts of our upcoming Civil War explorations.

Nearly drifting off to snoozeville at 2:30am, I was suddenly alerted to the faint smell of smoke. Knowing that the suite's fireplace was not in operation, I sensed that the smoke smell resembled clothes that became smoky after being near a source of fire.

To confirm my suspicions, I smelt the bed covers and sheets for signs of smoke. There were no smoke smells emitting from the blankets or sheets. Yet, my nostrils were distinctly filled with smoke.

Not really understanding why there were whiffs of smoke in the air, I started to get uncomfortably frightened. Within two minutes of breathing in smoke, it suddenly stopped.

At this point in time, sleep was utterly impossible. With the thought of smoke resonating in my mind, the reflections of our ensuing Civil War adventure quickly disappeared.

Pondering the smoke scenario for several moments, my senses were put on guard once again when the aroma of smoke reappeared. If one thought I was shaken upon the first sign of smoke, I was now petrified.

The second bout of smoke lingered around my bed for a couple of moments, and sure enough, it went away. With the scent of smoke on the third occasion, my skin went prickly when I perceived a presence directly behind me in bed. 

Shuddering and not willing to turn around to confront this strongly felt bed-sharing companion, the odour of smoke surfaced for a third time. Not only that, but my unwelcomed bed companion's presence became even more apparent. I figuratively jumped out of my skin with fear. With tingling goose bumps larger than skittles, body hair standing at full attention and the breakout of a cold sweat, I steadfastly refused to turn around in bed to meet this uncharacteristic apparition. 

After two minutes of non-stop quivering like a full-bodied bobble head, the malignant sensations suddenly ceased. The smoke completely dissipated and the ghostly bed guest impression was not felt any longer. 

Do you think that this moment of reprieve brought me any sleep? You can forget about that notion. With a radiating fear that there should be an uninvited return of who knows what, sleep might have finally been greeted at 6am. 

With three hours of disturbed on and off sleep, I awoke to check up on Cooper. Not wanting to wake Cooper from his deep sleep, I slipped off to the Inn's dining area for breakfast.

Meeting the Innkeeper, Cheryl, for the first time, I was impressed with her friendly demeanour. In addition to being kind and personable, Cheryl is a kitchen wizard and prepared a palate pleasing breakfast for me.

Once her kitchen chores were over, Cheryl joined me at the table for a cup of tea. After last night's extravaganza, my inquiries for the Innkeeper were spilling over. The first question out of my mouth was, ""Cheryl, have you ever encountered anything untoward in this Inn?"" Cheryl briefly reflected upon this question and replied, ""I have only been working at this Inn for one and a half years, but I have experienced some unexplainable occurrences."" Begging the Innkeeper to continue, she shared the following with me, ""On a number of occasions, I overhear little prancing footsteps gracing the upper floors of this Inn. At the time, I knew that there were no tenants in the Inn so I naturally thought it was the spirit of the little girl scampering about this seventeenth century facility."" 

""Did you happen upon any other questionable episodes, Cheryl?"" I asked.

 ""Yes, but I do not tell this tale too often."" said Cheryl in a solemn manner. 

Inquisitive as all hell, I implored her for the narrative by promising Cheryl with my story of an unnatural involvement last night. Now curious, Cheryl was pleased to inform me of her experience relating to an elderly tenant who suddenly screamed and grabbed his right shoulder while ascending the main floor's stairs to the top suite. Luckily, the elderly man's wife and Cheryl were there to catch him as he was falling backwards from the fourth step at the bottom of the landing. 

The agony stricken man was dragged to a chair in the dining lounge and as soon as he collapsed on the chair, the breathless man stuttered, ""Did you see him?"" The gent's wife and Innkeeper, Cheryl, inquired in unison, ""See who?"" The frightened man then firmly grabbed the chair handles, gazed awkwardly up and related the following story: 

""A Confederate soldier by the name of Private Ron appeared at the top of the landing and through a series of flashbacks, he told me his story. Just seven days after his 15th birthday, Ron lied about his age and voluntarily joined the Confederate Army in Tupelo, Mississippi on January 10, 1862. Thanks to his father and grandfather, Ron was an avid hunter and very adept with his musket rifle. While training in Jackson, Mississippi, the officers were impressed with Private Ron's marksmanship and recruited him as a sharpshooter in a Brigade of Mississippians under General William Barksdale.

Private Ron and his Mississippian Brigade fought bravely from March through to September, 1862 in the Peninsula Campaign, the Seven Days Battles, the Charge at Malvern Hill and the Battle of Antietam. 

Upon arriving to Fredericksburg in early November, 1862, Private Ron and his Brigade of Mississippians were given orders to slow General Ambrose Burnside's Union Army from crossing the Rappahannock River in the blue-bellies attempt to enter the City of Fredericksburg. After surviving a hellacious two hour Union Army cannon fire which reduced many of the Fredericksburg's riverside structures to rubble, Private Ron held steadfast at his upper window post within the unharmed Richard Johnston Inn.

 After experiencing severe losses, the Union troops eventually managed to cross the Rappahannock to engage in a vicious building to building street fight battle with General Barksdale's Confederate Brigade. Inordinately outnumbered, Private Ron and his Mississippian sharpshooters managed to slow General Burnside's vast amount of advancing Union soldiers for several hours. While undertaking an exchange of fire with the enemy at street level, Private Ron was struck in the right shoulder with a musket ball. The pain Private Ron felt while lying on the bedroom floor was excruciating.

 Seeing that the odds were insurmountable, General Barksdale had his bugler sound the retreat for the battered and bruised Mississippian Brigade. As Barksdale's Mississippi Brigade retreated to join General Robert E. Lee on Marye's Heights south of Fredericksburg, Private Ron was left for dead.

Because of his young age, the Union Army doctors earnestly administered medical treatment to Private Ron.However, like all upper body injuries to Civil War soldiers, Private Ron succumbed to his shoulder wound and died in that same bedroom's bed three agonizing days later on November 22, 1862."" 

Subsequent, to hearing this fascinating story from the slow to relax gent, his wife asked, ""Dear, you were never interested in Civil War history; how can you now possibly be privy to this extensively detailed story."" Nonchalantly, the husband stared unblinkingly at his wife and replied, ""Private Ron informed me of all this while I was being struck in the shoulder with a mini-ball."" With the conclusion of this tantalizing tale, the storyteller's spouse turned to the Innkeeper, Cheryl, and they cast a quizzical look at one another.

""It's your turn to regale me with your story."" stated Cheryl. To Cheryl's patient ear, I described in every detail to what occurred during my unsettling sleep in the Inn that night. Once the story was finished, the Innkeeper matter of factly exclaimed, ""Oh, you met the slave, Toby."" Aware of the three ghostly forms that haunted the Inn, I asked Cheryl how she knew it was a visit from Toby. ""It's a simple deduction."" And Cheryl continued, ""Before Toby met his unceremonious demise by the hangman's rope, he was tasked with the responsibility of maintaining the eleven fireplaces within the Inn. So that clearly explains why you smelt smoky clothing."" 

Alarmed, I asked Cheryl the following question, ""I'm staying in the Inn for two more nights; what should I do?"" Showcasing a wry grin, the sage Innkeeper quickly answered my nervous question with, ""Let us hope that Toby doesn't feel lonely and hops under the bed covers with you."" I left the dining area wondering if Fredericksburg's Holiday Inn Express had a vacant room for rent."
"The Cereal Box","New York","Haunted Places","Recently, I've been thinking about all of the paranormal experiences that I have had in my home. As far as I can remember, there are only one or two that I have not shared with you. One of them, I'm not even sure can be considered a paranormal experience.

The one I am about to share with you however, most certainly can. It happened probably about 4-6 months ago now.

 My sister was sitting in our Living Room watching her shows. I had come downstairs to talk to her a little bit, and maybe ask her to watch tv in her room because I wanted to play a couple video games.

We were talking about how we wanted to do something over the weekend, when all of a sudden we hear something fall off a shelf in the pantry. As soon as that happened, we were both really creeped out. Both of our parents had already gone upstairs, and the shelves in our pantry are too high for our cats to reach. I walk into the kitchen, and sitting in the pantry doorway, is a box of cereal. You would think, that if a box of cereal had fallen, it would have landed on its widest side right? This box was standing up; just like you would see it on a shelf. I stood in the entrance of our kitchen and just stared it. I wasn't sure what to do. Normally, I would pick the box up, and put it back on the shelf, but something was telling me that picking it up, was the last thing I wanted to do. I was frozen.

I must have only been standing there for a few seconds, but it felt like a lot longer. I very slowly left the room, keeping my eyes on the box for as long as I could. As soon as I got back to the living room, I told my sister what I had seen. She could tell that something about the whole situation had scared me. She went a little pale, and glanced at the kitchen door. I couldn't help but notice how tense things had become.

I honestly believe, that my sister and I made the right choice that night when we decided to go back upstairs, and not come back down until morning."
"Noon Time Knocking (3)","Connecticut","Haunted Places","Hey y'all. I haven't been around much, as I've started to have a few health issues here and there (nothing paranormal, because I don't think anything supernatural can cause kidney stones. Haha) Anyways, the sightings have dropped down, however something incredibly unsettling happened today, and it had me worried.

So I watch my nephew for a few hours every Tuesday and Thursday. He's barely 2 years old, a big sweetie and just. I could gush about him all day. Today, my mom was helping me watch him and we put him down for a nap in my mom's bedroom. He fell asleep at 12:15. At 12:29, the knocking occurred. Our dogs went nuts barking and woke him up. Normally, we can calm the dogs down and he will curl back up and go back to sleep. Today, for some odd reason, no matter which room we put him in, with his binki, his pillow, stuffed animals and so on - he would wail. Scream. He threw a fit and fought us until we eventually gave up and let him run around. Not long after, his daddy came home and I took him back to his house.

Later, I took a shower and was laying on my bed and promptly laid down the law to whatever is in the house. I made sure it was very clear they are NOT allowed to knock on the walls or ANYTHING when he is over. They are to exist in this house with us, but not scare us. I laid down the law the best I could.

I do want to make a note that my nephew is definitely seen spirits before. He regularly points to pictures of my grandparents and talks like they are an old friend, and while he doesn't have the biggest vocabulary, the boy's mother is a pre-school teacher, so he's developed fairly advanced. His baby camera in his room actually tends to go off when no one is home, telling my sister that there is movement in his room. (She has one of those sorta webcam cameras that hooks up to a special app on your phone.) 

This is a tad short, but just wanted to drop this off and see what everyone's thoughts were!"
"Spirits In New Home","Mississippi","Haunted Places","I was living in GRENADA in 2015 and I was Living with my Family. So we decided to Shift to a new Home. My Father Searched for a home for a long time but he found one later on in Nearby Neighborhood. We decided to shift ASAP.

We loaded all of our stuff and shifted there. My mum started to feel the presence of a weird thing since she entered the house now we unpacked all of our Stuff.

It was midnight, we all had our dinner and went to sleep. I decided to stay awake and watch TV and just after 1 am I felt something just hit on the back of my head. Then after a few minutes my brother screamed from the washroom that he just saw a girl behind him in the bathroom's mirror. I rushed to CHECK but found nothing there, after that I was able to continuously hear strange voices of a woman screaming from the TV lounge and a girl screaming from washroom. 

I rushed to my parents and all of the Family members were able to hear all of noises.

Just after 14 hours, YES just 14 hours we shifted back to our old place.

When me and my father went back to pickup our stuff the neighbors told us that there was a family of a Father, Mother and their daughter, in which the Father poisoned his daughter with Washroom Detergents and escaped. The Mother committed suicide in the TV lounge cuz she was very desperate, and we were lucky enough that none of the Spirits followed us back to our OLD place."
"Am I Seeing My Brother?","California","Family / Friends Visits","Earlier this year I received a call from my sister telling me Luis, our brother, had passed away. Luis had been sick for a while; he was getting dialysis a couple of times per week so I believe he had kidney problems. He passed away in January 2018, he would have been 51 in April, when he was younger he use to drink a lot and I heard rumors that he had dabbled in some drug use.

 I had not talked to my brother in a long time, even though he lived just a few minutes from me. I was upset with him because when our father was ill, Luis never came to visit him. My dad would always worry about Luis, would constantly ask if he had called or come over while he was sleeping. When they would speak on the phone, Luis always promised to visit but he never did. At my dad's funeral, of all my siblings, Luis seemed the most affected. I have always thought it was remorse for not going to see my dad when he was alive. I was very resentful towards him and when I found out he was sick I never went to visit. 

At my brother's viewing, I did not approach his casket, not because I was still mad, but because I was told that he did not look anything like him. He had lost a lot of weight and looked older than his 50 years. I wanted to remember him as he was when he was healthy. 

I start work quite early, so it is still dark when I leave my house and drive to work. There has been a few times when I drive by a church that is on my way to work and standing there, waiting for the bus, is this man that looks exactly like my brother. He's tall like my brother and stands like him (if that makes sense), he's always smoking a cigarette and is wearing the same clothes my brother use to wear. When I drive by him, he turns and looks at me even though it's dark out. He looks like my brother did when he was younger. Sometimes I turn and look at him too, other times I'm looking straight ahead but can still feel him looking at me. 

I have told myself that this is just someone that looks like him, but besides the resemblance, there a ""feeling"" I get. It's like my mind and heart recognize him. Then there's this other thing, every time I see him I cry the rest of the drive to work. Then at night, as I'm falling asleep, I feel someone touches me and/or sits on my bed and is looking at me. 

I have not told my mother any of this, I do not want to upset her. I already know what she is going to tell me, ""pray for him, tell him you forgive him that everything is okay and he should rest in peace"". I have done this a few times, I stop seeing and feeling him for a while then it happens again. Oh, I forgot to mention that I also dream of him a lot. 

It breaks my heart to think that he feels there is some unfinished ""business"" between us and that his soul is not at peace. Anyone have any recommendations or advise on how to help him move on?"
"A Creepy Night","Florida","Haunted Places","A few years ago, a friend of mine that I had not seen in a while got in touch with me and asked if I would like to go over to their house and have dinner.

 I was happy that my friend got in touch with me. I had never been to my friend's house. My friend lives two hours away so I don't get to see them as much as I would have liked and I had not been to their new apartment yet.

 So when I got there I knew something was off but I wasn't sure why. I am sensitive when it comes to spirits. My friend and I are talking and eating dinner and we were having a fun time but that little feeling just wouldn't go away so I say ""I have this feeling a creepy kind of feeling that I get being in your house."" My friend says my house is haunted. He explains to me that there was a spirit that loved playing with his young sons toys. The son was a baby at the time.

 Every time I went to use his bathroom the feeling got worse. After dinner we stayed up talking and hanging with the his baby. It ended up being 1:00 in morning and I was tired so I was ready to go home but since the drive was very far he told me I should stay the night so I did. 

I was very tired like I said so I was ready to go to bed so I was heading to the bedroom with my friend and the door opens and closes by itself. I couldn't believe it. My friend says that the door opening and closing by itself happens every once in a while. He said that in the kitchen that cabinets would open by themselves all the time. I was scared and in shock when it happened. In the morning I was ready to go home. It was a long, fun night. That is one of a few other experiences."
"Attached Entity Or No?","Massachusetts","Misc","Ever since I can remember I've felt to be sensitive to paranormal experiences. The house I grew up in was said to be haunted I was told it was built on an Indian burial ground, not entirely sure that's true or not since I've searched the properties history online and couldn't find anything to match that.

 However, I always felt an eerie presence in the house so did my sisters and mother. I remember clearly my older sister saying to me one day ""hey get off me"" while she's laying on the couch with her back towards me when I was sitting across the room, she claims she felt a body laying up next to her.

 My mother also reported seeing shadows in the house. I used the ouija board as a kid playing around not really thinking anything of it, over the years I have had some questionable experiences happen to me.

 About 7 years ago I started to hear a whispering voice I can never make out what it's saying but when this happens my legs start to get tingly like a vibrating sensation. If I lay there it will slowly move up my legs and almost like something is sitting on top of them I can move my legs though so I know it's not sleep paralysis since I've done research on that and says you are not able to move during that time.

 I've read from others stories on here about a Succubus and my story is pretty similar except I have never had any sexual encounters with the entity.

 Like I said before this has been going on for about 7 years now off and on. It doesn't happen very often, it's random I'm just wondering what it could be? I don't think it is a bad spirit though, it's never caused me any harm although it does still freak me out time to time.

 My boyfriend brought up the idea of maybe being schizo but I was under the impression that's only hearing things not physically feeling them too? I don't know I would really appreciate some answers from someone who is more educated on this type of stuff please. Thank you"
"Mama Mia","Illinois","Family / Friends Visits","My mother-in-law, Mia, was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's a few years ago. She was around 55 at the time of discovery. This past month she declined very rapidly, so we travelled 2,000 miles from the west coast to the North Shore of Chicago to see her & wish her a speedy passing... At this point, she was not on life support & had been unable to swallow for some time. Basically starving to death; a very painful & agonizing way to go.

 

A quick backstory: Mia was of Italian descent & came from poverty. She became pregnant with my significant other when she was just 15, dropped out of high school & worked to support her baby - her home life & upbringing were difficult to say the least. When Mia was in her early 20's, she met a handsome, older Italian man; a guest at the hotel bar she was working at, at the time. 17 years her senior, they eventually married and had two sons together; her husband, I'll call him Tony, adopted my beau & raised him as his own. Tony was a wealthy businessman in Chicago & spoiled the hell out of Mia & the boys.

 

Tony & Mia eventually divorced. The beautiful, stately, Victorian home on the north shore Tony worked hard to get for his family sold. Despite their marriage dissolving, the two remained close friends. He stood by her until the very end.

 

In the early years of our relationship, Mia & I were very close. My other half, her oldest son, was a serial monogamist, never married, & in his late 30's when we met. Mia & I talked on the phone often, texted, & planned girls-only getaways that would never materialize. She never liked any of his girlfriends until she met me - she said I was the daughter she never had - a mother of 3 boys and called me ""baby girl"".   (That last part is worth consideration in a bit.) 

 

Now, here is where I may get some scoffs & judgment, that's fine - it has little to do with the rest of the story but I feel it's relevant. A few months ago, I downloaded the Ghost Radar app with very few expectations.  I've used it a few times to see what would materialize & nothing of note has happened, but one evening I was outside on the patio with the app running.  It said, ""east"".  So, out of curiosity, I walked east on our property which brought me down to the garden.  Silence.  Came back up to the patio and it said, ""August"".  Then soon after, ""prepare"".  At the time, ""east"" didn't resonate with me, but I found ""prepare"" & ""August"" troubling, like something bad was going to happen... And it did. 

 

Mia's battle with Alzheimer's was a true battle. My other half & I received news on August 15th that her time was limited. Flights were booked, tears were shed, & we prepared for the worst...sadly, you never can truly prepare.  August; prepare.  Illinois is east of Oregon, where we live.    

A few days before we left for Chicago, her youngest son came to Oregon to see us. He'd gone to visit Mia in the nursing home earlier this spring before she was nonverbal and recorded some conversations. Some made sense, most didn't. One that haunted me was Mia talking about seeing a baby girl who had died, due to lack of oxygen. ""Yes, just a baby, baby girl, baby girl..."" Part of me believes she meant that me, her ""baby girl"" had ""died"" in that we hadn't spoken in so long. Combined with the confusion of the disease... Her oldest son had breathing problems as a young boy. 

 

When we arrived at hospice the following week, the otherwise fit, vibrant woman we loved had wasted away to an 80lb sack of skin & bones, incoherent, unable to communicate. That Tuesday she seemed to be trying to speak, but just uttered noises. She made eye contact & seemed responsive to music we played for her. The following day she'd declined even more, eyes barely open, mouth unable to close, & very close to death. It was truly the most unbearable thing I've witnessed in my lifetime. Towards the evening on Tuesday, her youngest son, 27, came to see her one last time. He spent the night by her side.

 

The next morning on Wednesday, we'd slept in & planned to visit Mia at hospice in the afternoon, but we didn't make it in time. My father in law received a call at 2:45 saying her breathing had become very shallow & her vitals were poor. We gathered our things, hopped in the car. A 25-minute drive away, she passed at 3:15, barely missing her. Tony got the call when we were just a few blocks away.

 

We all spent some time with Mia's body, I gathered her things, the boys hugged their mom & kissed her forehead. We had made arrangements with a funeral home earlier in the week, so Tony called to confirm the time of service.

 

After her death, I was given the task of gathering photos for collages at the service. I was handed several boxes of old family photos - hundreds to each box. It was not easy, but such a pleasure to find old treasures like Mia pregnant with the boys, baby pictures, family vacations. Happier times. I was also asked, as the now-only female in the immediate family, to choose her clothes for the viewing. To me, it's a deeply personal thing to go though family photos, much less go through someone's clothes & choose a final dress for a funeral (I chose a brazen red designer dress, for the record).

 

Summers in Chicago are hot & very humid. Tony's not crazy about using the central air, so it was a constant struggle for me to keep the house cool - I'd turn it down to 68, an hour later he'd move it back to 80. We slept with the windows open, a big box fan blowing on us & the ceiling fan on. The ceiling fan turned on by one of those round dial switches on the wall; the kind that click when turned and you push it inward to flick on the light. The box fan was just that - one of those with the dial on top, not ""difficult"" to turn, but difficult for it to slip into the off position... Impossible if you ask me. The doors upstairs where the bedrooms always stick & creak - you can't open any of them without force, and it makes a noise the whole house could hear. Anytime I'd get up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom, the door would unstick so loudly the senior & hard-of-hearing dog downstairs would bark.

 

We started waking up with the box fan off, switch in the off position. We had it situated in the window, about 15 feet from the door, next to the bed. The ceiling fan would be off in the morning. I woke up in the middle of the night one night to the door rattling like a very gentle earthquake was occurring. I got up to shut the door & it was snug in its sticky jamb. There was absolutely no wind, & sadly the fans weren't powerful enough to make that door budge.

 One night while we were in bed, watching tv, the ceiling fan shut itself off. The switch was physically off. I got up like WTF? Turned the switch back on & we resumed our show. My other half seemed unfazed. He pretty much lives in denial whenever something strange happens, but I have to admit, this stuff started freaking me out a bit.

 

Every night I'd plug in the tablet to charge. In the morning, the plug would be loose from the outlet like someone had unplugged it. I thought the socket might be loose, but upon plugging it in again the first time it happened, it was very tight & not easily knocked out. I have a history with electrical issues, but none quite like this.

 

One afternoon my guy & I were in the house alone. It had gotten cloudy & the sky was dark, so we turned on some lights downstairs in the living room while tidying up. One lamp by the tv, I turned on. Not 5 minutes later, it flickered out & I didn't think much of it. A few hours after the youngest & his dad returned to the house, we walked into the living room & that lamp was on. My father in law said, ""Ah, you changed that bulb? It's been out for a long time & I haven't gotten around to replacing it."" I'm not reading too much into this, it could easily be bad wiring or a worn-out switch. Still worth noting given the other occurrences though.

 

On Saturday night, the night before Mia's service, the youngest bro, my beaux, & I were putting together a playlist for the visitation. The was visitation scheduled for 4 hours so it was a lot of time to fill... It took a while to pull her favorite songs & find appropriate music, so we were up late. I am a light sleeper and my partner & I have been sleeping in separate bedrooms for a while due to his snoring & nocturnal habits. On this trip, I made sure to get a pack of ear plugs - the obnoxious, bright fluorescent orange ones - so I could sleep. After finishing the playlist, I got ready for bed. One ear plug was missing.

 

I threw a fit & tore the bedroom apart. The floors are hardwood, so it was easy to scan the floor with my phone's flashlight with the help of overhead lights. Nothing. I looked & looked, & finally sighed, agreeing to watch something else before sleep. After the show I decided to look again. There right under the bed, plain as day in obnoxious bright orange was my missing ear plug under the bed on the floor... Where we had both looked about 10 times.

 

A few other strange things happened but I feel they are too personal & give away too much information to share anonymously. I can't help but think going through Mia's things, pulling out old photos, and being with her during the final days made her want to pop in for a visit once she left her earthly body.  Unfortunately, she had been ""dead"" to me for the last couple of years... As she succumbed to the disease, she became a very spiteful, mean person, rendering her intolerable to speak with or be around... She'd have me in tears within minutes, and said some really terrible things to her boys that left deep emotional scars.  We forgave her before she passed, but I think we all have a little lingering guilt for not being able to separate the disease from the person. Looking through photos reminded me of the wonderful person she once was - beautiful, funny, playful. The weird happenings may be debunk-able, but I choose to believe that Mia was showing us her playful presence once again, free from the prison of Alzheimer's."
"Keeping Watch","New Hampshire","Haunted Places","When we first moved to Concord, New Hampshire in July 1995 we lived in a small 2 bedroom condo near downtown. Really cute place, great for two adults (not great when we had kiddo #1 which is why we left - too small, no yard, etc.) The original building was quite old and had been partially destroyed by fire in the 1980's but was rebuilt, maintaining much of the original beams. I understand it had to be that way in order for them to rebuild on the site as the set-backs from the street were not current code and the building could only be grandfathered if it was restored using a certain percentage of the original materials. That certainly explained why we sometimes smelled burned wood in the apartment! We used one bedroom as our sleeping area and the other was set up as a home office as I was initially working from home.

While working in the office not long after we moved in, I had the sensation of being watched. It wasn't scary, just a little unsettling. This continued on and off for a few days - again, I didn't feel threatened, just felt like someone was watching me. I sensed that this presence was male, probably in his late 20's/early 30's, and wearing some kind of an old fashioned uniform. I never really ""saw"" this person; it was just a feeling or impression I got.

I mentioned the sensation of being watched to my husband and he just stared at me. He said, ""from the closet, right?"". Yep. ""And definitely a guy in a uniform, like an old-time police uniform."" Yes again. Mind you, we had NEVER discussed it before. He had seen/sensed the same thing in that room. Weird.

Our friend came to visit us in late September that year and he slept in that room. Guess what he said to us the next morning? ""You guys know you have a ghost in your closet, don't you?"" Now that made three of us who had seen/sensed it.

After our daughter was born, we used that room as her bedroom. She never saw the man; I think maybe he was aware that he might frighten her because of the uniform (?) and therefore only made his presence known to adults. Who knows? 

Some time later, my husband and I were at the Museum of NH History in downtown Concord, looking at some old maps of our neighborhood. It was clear that the house we lived in was located on what was the grounds for the original state prison in the early 1800s and the original building on our site was used as a barracks for the prison guards. Ding! Ding! Ding! THAT explained the uniform! We were so excited to discover this. 

I've never met the people who live there now. I'm often tempted to stop by and ask if they ever see the guard in that room. I hope that he crossed over, but if not, that he is happy keeping watch over the folks who share that space with him."
"My Grandfather's Chair","North Carolina","Haunted Items","My grandfather died in New Jersey in 1939; his daughter, my mother, turned 4 about a month and a half later. All Mom remembers about her father is that he would hold her in a rocking chair and read to her. There is an older sister who confirms this. 

In 1959 my parents were living in Arizona and, in anticipation of their first (me) they bought a rocking chair at a second hand store, what would now be called a thrift store I suppose. I can't tell you anything of the history of the chair. I can find no marking on it. It's a wood frame with a padded leather seat (which has been reupholstered several times since it's been in the family), likely manufactured pre-war (WWII).

Sometime in 1960 my Pop became the first person to see the chair rock. This wasn't real surprising as the house was old, near a busy street without air conditioning (so the windows were frequently open), and the family included two cats, so Pop really didn't take much notice of it. The Chair followed the family to New Jersey and later to Illinois where my memories of the chair begin. Growing up with the Chair it was always known that, from time to time, the Chair would rock without an occupant. It didn't do all the time or even frequently. It seems to happen more when Mom was upset long term. Many people have seen the Chair rock over the years: family members, guests, but oddly, not Mom. The Chair has been seen rocking at all times, not just at night. I don't recall anyone saying that they've actually seen the Chair start to rock, though many have seen it stop, and some (myself included) have stopped it. Mom has always maintained that the Chair was rocked by her father who was just checking on us. When asked about how she came to think this, she smiles and says that her father told her so. We never get more out of her than that. Likely I'll share more tales of Mom's ghosts (don't read this wrong Mom is looking to celebrate another birthday before the end of the month). 

To be honest, all of my life we've had pets in the house, usually cat (or cats) but often cat and dog; either of which could cause a chair to rock. To my knowledge I've never seen a cat sit in the Chair - I don't think it's sinister, though it may at first sound it. The animals don't avoid the chair. I've held cats while sitting in the Chair. Dogs will nuzzle you while you're in the Chair, like any other piece of furniture. The Chair has survived multiple re-decorations of the various houses. It has traveled from Arizona to New Jersey, to Illinois (two addresses), to Wisconsin, to Texas (two addresses) to New Mexico, back to Arizona, and finally to North Carolina. I believe it is the piece of furniture that has been in the family the longest, though Mom and Pop got some older furniture when Pop's parents passed. The Chair has now held four generations, five if you count my Grandfather... Poetic license I'm fairly certain that it held the three grand parents who lived to see it.

So what brought this story to mind? Earlier this year ago our niece was visiting Mom and Dad with her husband and children. Twice during the week the husband was awakened by a noise and when he investigated (an Army Officer he) he saw the Chair was rocking. He thought, perhaps, their small dog had jumped down from it...

The Chair and Mom are the primary reason I come to this site."
"Anger Of A Dark Entity","Indiana","Haunted Places","This happened in 2016

In 2006 I lost a sister to cancer. She's buried in my hometown of Mishawaka in a cemetery called Fairview. 

Now I've had things happen here before. But this cemetery isn't where this activity takes place. Across the street there's another cemetery. An old Catholic cemetery. 

Whenever we had gone to my sister's grave, my one friend always felt like she felt a force pulling her to the Catholic cemetery across the street. We had never gone. Until one day we decided to explore it. Now me and my friends like to go on our own ghost hunts in the area and we've had a ton of things happen. But those are stories for another day. 

It was a cloudy day. I don't remember the exact day or time but it was in the afternoon. 

We were exploring the cemetery my sister is buried in when my friend (We'll call her lisa), felt the feeling she always felt whenever she went there. So we decided to go over and check things out. Little did we know of the chain of events that were about to take place. 

It was 5 of us at the time, We walked into the entrance and didn't feel a thing. Then I saw a fence with an open gate that went back even farther to some of the older graves. We go in and instantly we feel something heavy. Everyone's worried but we press on. 

My stupid self at one point said I would hold off whatever would or could come while they ran. That was the start. 

We were walking around exploring when I walk past this stone mausoleum. I could feel something trying to communicate with me but I shook it off. 

I tell my friends what happened and they all head over to look at it. There was a small hole in the door. 

My friends decide to look in. Nothing happens. But then I look in. I feel then get pushed back by a wave of energy. 

I then get a bad feeling and we start to leave. As were leaving we look through the fence to see a tall shadow figure standing next to the mausoleum. We stop for a second and stare in awe.

Now one of my friends with us can read auras. Certain colors tell what that person or thing is feeling. 

This one's aura was blood red. It was pissed off. It starts to walk toward us. We start running to the entrance scared. 

The thing is though, I'm pretty sure it projected it's feelings onto me because I could feel its anger. The more mad it got the more mad I got. 

It got to a point where I was cursing under my breath telling it to leave us alone. At one point I was about to go back and confront it. Thankfully my friend stopped me and we continued running. 

We were parked in the cemetery called Fairview across the street. We run out of the Catholic cemetery to Fairview and the figure actually follows us out. We run into the entrance of Fairview. It tries to enter but something is keeping it out. We get into the car and book it out of there. As we drive I see the figure just staring us down. 

To this day I have no clue what thing could have been. I have never felt anger like that before. And I've been to that cemetery a few times since then. It has never popped back up. Did we disturb something's slumber? Or was something there toying with us?

All I know is it's something I'll never forget."
"Someone's Trapped In The Rv","Colorado","Haunted Places","It has been 3 years since I have posted a story on this site. The story I am about to tell is completely unexplainable and without a doubt, strange as the new property we live on has no history of hauntings. 

It all started when I woke up at 5 AM. My dad had been walking around and was doing so because he was getting ready to leave for work. I woke up and had to go to the bathroom that was in the RV next door. To provide some background information, the property that we live on is surrounded by forest and underdeveloped. We have a house, a cabin and an RV. The RV is where we take showers and use the restroom. 

After I got back from the RV I tried to fall back to sleep. I began to hear loud hitting on the rv door. It was as if someone was banging their fists against the door. The bangs were very loud and with each bang the latch on the door would make a clicking sound. This went on for 5 minutes then stopped then went on again. I heard the door open, I later found out my sister had opened the door. She had told my mom that the banging stopped as soon as she touched the door. No one was in the RV and if they were, there would be no time for their escape. 

To further back this up, there is nothing but miles of forest and at 5 AM it is extremely dark outside. We tried to look for a valid explanation when there was none. 

There really is no explanation for what happened, but the memory of it still haunts our whole family to this day. We always fear that it could be the spirit that haunted us in number 19."
"Birth Date And Death Date","Louisiana","Family / Friends Visits","The most satisfying relationship in my life is the one with my maternal grandmother. She's my best friend, my first love and she holds a significant aspect of my peace within her being; I feel secure and unconditionally loved in her presence. And though, I moved to Atlanta years ago, I'd visit New Orleans frequently, we'd talk often and she'd mail cards religiously.

On my birthday, August 24, 2018, she died in ICU from cardiac arrest (she was in the hospital for a UTI and dehydration) and I am wondering, if you all find any significance in her dying on my birthday or is it a coincidence? 

Also, I don't want to read too much into this, but I believe her presence might be near, because-- I feel the same wave of calm every so often that I felt when she was on earth. And the night she died I felt a vibration on my hands-- the next day, I felt that same vibration on my lower lip. I have read that when a spirit touches you, it feels like a vibration. What are your thoughts?

Lastly, her favorite color is yellow and two weeks ago while at the Banana Republic I saw a yellow dress and (for no apparent reason) I was contemplating buying it for her funeral, but she wasn't even sick. I'd also cried at least 3 times this year at the thought of her departure, though she had no ailments. My mother shared with me a few days ago that my grandmother told to her to give her wedding set to me when she passes. Are things things meaningful regarding her transition?

I would appreciate any feedback."
"The Spirit Of Jeffrey Dahmer?","Minnesota","Haunted Places","My name is Camille. I am thirteen going on fourteen, and I live in Iron, Minnesota. Let me start at the very beginning.

 A couple years back, (maybe just a year ago), I was very obsessed with these online games, specifically MovieStarPlanet, which at the time, took up a great portion of my summer. On this online platform, there was a ""forum"" room, where people could rant or just enjoy each other's company. I remember this one topic being everywhere and I mean EVERYWHERE all over the forums. ""Hey, how do you feel about My Friend Dahmer?"" I thought it was just another foolish internet fad and would die away eventually, but soon my curiosity piqued and I read a forum.

 Before I even read it, I had a weird sense that ""Dahmer"" was the friend of this guy in high-school, and ""Dahmer"" had grown to be this terrible person in real life (or at least do terrible things.). I even pictured this guy having longer blond hair and blue eyes, without ANY indication on whom the actual Jeffrey Dahmer was. Since a lot of things were censored on the website, there wasn't a lot to talk about in regards to the movie, other than people asking each ""other,"" do you think My Friend Dahmer is controversially bad?"" So that already gave me weird vibes because they were saying it was controversial when I knew that the guy had done something morally inhumane, when I have had never in my life, swear on my grandfather's grave, ever heard the name Jeffrey Dahmer. I remember telling myself I'd look up what it actually was later on but never did and naturally forgot.

 Fast forward about a year later. I was watching Youtube when I suddenly, it almost felt as though this had been pushed into my head, I thought of it again. My Friend Dahmer. My curiosity was still very much active so I typed it into the search-bar and was welcomed by half a dozen movie trailers. I picked the most ""promising"" and was instantly greeted by teen angst and 70's inspired cars, outfits, and hair. I quickly took notice of Ross Lynch's role as Dahmer (which I admit was kind of a shocker itself.) The trailer in fact showed the movie was on the darker side and was also in fact based on true events. (Both in which I had originally thought, again, with no knowledge at all of Jeffrey Dahmer.) I remember falling in love with Lynch's portrayal. I was happy for the guy, who seemed to be doing fairly well after Disney and all. I believe the name ""Jeffrey Dahmer"" was only mentioned once at the very end of the trailer, so that's when I pulled it up on google. 

 ""Jeffrey Dahmer, American serial killer and sex offender."" That fazed me for some reason, and I felt dread, pure dread. I went into images and the dread worsened, along with this odd side note of nostalgia. It felt like my soul, not me, my soul or my subconscious KNEW him. Something inside of me was happy that I had found this guy, but it wasn't, well... Me.

 Something inside of me knew this guy. I hadn't ever seen this man's face but for some reason it looked so familiar, like I had casually chatted with him over tea at morning brunch. This guy looked pretty bad in appearance, unshaven, tired, with a distant stare. My first initial reaction was ""gross"", but I couldn't help but feel bad as instantly as I had said it. All of it felt so unusual something I have never felt before, like this instinctive wave, like this flood of emotion, which despite seeming so foreign made perfect sense to that thing inside of me. It made sense to my subconscious, higher self, but not to my conscious, who was oblivious to this emotional blow that had struck me when I had laid eyes on his face for the first time. I felt so connected to this man, and it scared me. I tried to get rid of the feeling of connection by ignoring it but eventually decided to try and understand it instead. I researched him and soon became hooked. I knew this guy. I really did. It felt like the whole time I was being so foolish in ignoring all of this because deep down some part of me must have known him. 

 I noticed that I didn't see him as a serial killer at all. Yes, he did horrible things, but he was in no way evil. He didn't get power over killing his victims. He just hated the idea of loneliness. In fact, he was more of a miserable, sappy, depressing person than anything else. Just a totally sad person with little self control. He didn't enjoy killing anyone. The goal was to have complete dominance over someone (sexually). Killing was never his first option, he went through many ways to try and get rid of his dark fantasies, he wasn't a careless person. He cared, and that's why he tried to stop himself and find ways to stop. But he was also battling himself. He could never kill someone unless he was drunk himself, which says a lot about how he felt about it. I do not support him. What he did was unforgivably wrong, but he was in no way a Richard Ramirez. People have told me I understand him better than anyone else could, which makes me proud but afraid as well.

 I noticed that I had been experiencing abnormal things. At first it started out with cold spots and just random breezes of freezing air. (I know it wasn't my breath because, I would breath again and see if I felt any cold air. I am also in the basement so there are no windows that can open willingly.) Then it progressed into somebody stroking my cheek whilst I was writing my novel on my laptop. (My hair was pulled back completely.) 

 I tried dismissing all of this but eventually I went on to have a dream of a place that was completely white with this glowing aura and Jeffrey Dahmer was there. I don't quite remember what he said, but he was really upset about something and I was concerned. 

 I explained it (Not using Dahmer's name because she is unaware of this.) to my mother, and she said that it might've been heaven. I was confused and didn't really believe it but kept it in mind. 

 Then I finally decided to get a spirit box app and when I asked who I was speaking to it replied with ""Jeff."" At this point I was very freaked out and kind of confused. I had also been seeing orbs moving around (which my best friend had pointed out one day, along with the cold spots, when she came over before I had told her anything about this, I had thought it was only eye ""floaters"") every once in a while.

 Then the ""light incident"" occurred. I have these Christmas lights hanging in my bedroom (everything occurs in my bedroom.), and I have one of those foam tile ceilings so they often have gaps and such. My lights had fallen in front of my door, and it made it impossible to close the door. I was also too short (5'2"") to put them in between the tiles, so they wouldn't get in the way. One day in particular I had gotten very angry and had cursed out about the lights when I had to use the bathroom very bad. My family was going grocery shopping so we all left the house. I came back and noticed my door shut. I was the last one out of the house and hadn't shut my door when I had left. The lights were neatly folded between the tiles, so they wouldn't get in my way. I tensed up. I felt this strange euphoric feeling of love radiating from someone watching me that I couldn't see, but they had done this just for ME. I went from afraid, to flattered and thanked whoever it was. 

 At this point I began thinking it was Jeffrey Dahmer. I had no known relatives who had died who were taller, Jeff Dahmer in fact was about 6' or 6'1"". I used a Ouija board and asked if it truly was Jeffrey Dahmer and it said yes and he answered many difficult questions just for proof. I now believe it is his spirit with me, but am still unsure... The spirit box app I use even talks in that same distinguishing way he does, saying ""folks"" and ""baloney."" 

 A couple of nights ago I was in a very bad state. I was crying, and I had begun to think I was insane for believing all this for almost nine months. I asked for a sign, for a sign I wasn't wrong. I went to bed and had a dream of being in this place, it was all fuzzy, with two bouquets of roses, one this ugly orange peach color (I thought it was ugly but usually I love peach roses?) and these most beautiful pure white ones. I kept thinking ""I have to get one for Jeff it has to be red though"" it was this persistent thought. I would ask myself why but my brain would just insist on red ones but there were none. I sensed other people there with me but couldn't see them, which was weird. Everything faded out into black and faded in again and I was standing in front of Jeffrey Dahmer with these big beautiful, the prettiest deep red roses I had ever laid eyes on. We were in this place everything was faded but it was this white beautiful place. He was glowing, he looked so pure and lively. All I could see was him and focus on was him and me. 

There was this intense feeling, almost telepathic, where I knew what he was feeling and vice versa. It was this feeling of love, this amazing, peaceful feeling. We were happy, HE was happy. Then suddenly all of it was ripped away, and it was cold and dark again. That's when I awoke and my dead roses that I keep by my bedside smelled so lively and beautiful like they had never smelled before. It was all so amazing to endure. May I also admit that I do love Dahmer, it's not something I admit due to controversy but those are my honest feelings. After just spending so much time actually getting inside his head, seeing him ways other's refuse and him being here, I've fallen for him, which I'm not thrilled about, I hate it so much because I feel as though I sound insane. But uh, I might as well clear that up. I'm not one of those creepy people who worship serial killers, I do not believe Jeffrey is god, nor anything else related to that. I am a firm believer in the lord, Jesus Christ, though I was not raised Christian. Do you think this could be Dahmer and please help explain this weird connection I feel with him, it's all awfully confusing."
"The Man In My Bathroom","Missouri","Haunted Places","This all started a little over a year ago I believe. My house was built in the 1950s and was very retro when we moved in. We did renovations and made it more modern to fit us. I have a son who is now 3 and have had other family members living with us (they've moved out now). 

It started with my bathroom, one night everything on the shelves ""fell"" off and was scattered on the floor. Except for the bag that was on the top shelf was set neatly on the ground. My sister heard it but thought it was the dog or cat, but my son and I, being in the same room, heard nothing at all. I got up to use the restroom and saw the mess, got my mom and sister to look and ended up leaving the mess there. 

Next thing I know I'm back in bed I hear the brushes and hair tools being played with and moved around, I open the door leaving the light on so whatever it is can get out. 

Things only got worse, I felt Heavy all the time and had awful nightmares of my son being taken or me being dragged out of bed. I felt as if all my energy was being drained from me constantly.

 I was Praying one night which I don't do much of, after praying a man's voice at the end of my bed yelled a deep no at me and I froze and began to scream for my mom. I refused to sleep in there for a week until someone came to help.

 A man came and told me what he thought, something was there and was irritated. Never heard from him again. 

Next thing, my nephew tells me there's a man in my bathroom and he's not nice.

 Things stopped but last night, someone started banging on my bed frame to wake me and we heard a girl whisper (my friend says the girl said my name).

 I believe there was a child here once from video recording a voice and also my clothes get tugged on at a low point or feeling little hands brush my legs. My son was speaking to someone and asked ""what happened to your face"" then proceeded to take their hand and say bye mommy and walk to the door. He refuses to sleep in his room because of the monsters and my nephew would cry and scream about the man getting him. 

My family has had few experiences but I've had the most, and have tried protection, rocks, sage and I've even talked to them and asked them to leave but nothing seems to work. I wake up at night feeling an awful dread and feeling of being watched, it's very uncomfortable and my son wakes up crying at night. 

Advice, anyone?"
"Please Send Good Thoughts","Massachusetts","Haunted Places","This may be the most believable story you will ever read. Unless this sickness takes me before, I will, on the 31st of this month, at 7:00 a.m. Be undergoing a nine to twelve hour surgery. I feel it may be unlikely that I will survive and that is ok, but I am much saddened it will leave my husband of forty-eight years, alone, but I will finally find answers.

I ask of you, if you will, please say a prayer of your faith, or just whisper, perhaps good thoughts. I have felt so much kindness from many of you on YGS. Your prayers, thoughts, and kindness will join all the other interesting people, sending the same, from far and near. Like you, I have never had the pleasure of meeting many of these other wonderful people other then from on line connections. Added to that will be the many people I have known through life.

I will try in a gentle way to reach out to you, or if I survive I will write as soon as possible, even if I am unable until October. Perhaps I would be able to convey what I might learn. So many maybes.

What I can tell you is, I have had several visitation dreams in the past week, dreams that woke me, and I wrote them down, before going back to sleep. A couple of them I don't remember ever knowing them, in this life. For me, this is a warning, I think. But could be wrong. I also have had flashes of people going by, as I lay going to sleep. It is like they are walking on a sidewalk and looking at me, as they pass. I do not know them.

The Cowboy truck driver is visiting again, he has often been sitting on my couch, or at a kitchen chair, when I, in thirst at night, head to the fridge for a drink. I never took the time to write about him, he was killed on the road, around 1950ish, that my house is on. I have seen him, now and again, these past 39 years living here, but he has resisted all my efforts to help in going to the light. He once indicated no one was waiting for him. 

I am sorry the other material I have had in mind to share will never get written, or maybe it will! Thanks to all at YGS.

My Love, and my best to you,

Jan"
"Indian Burial Grounds & More","Kentucky","Haunted Places","I have no idea what I could possibly be experiencing and barely know where to start. I just turned 20, on the 11th. Ever since I was a boy, my mother always told me I got my ""intuitiveness"" from her and I started understanding what she meant as I had my first visual experience down in Florida when I was around six years old. I have always been a curious kid to say the least.

 When I was around 13 to 14, me and a buddy of mine we're out in the backwoods of Kentucky probably on some land we shouldn't have been on - but you know how kids are. He knew the location of an Indian burial ground, and man was I excited. Well off the trails, on a fair incline, laid large limestone rocks forming over an obvious mound. Being a bit reckless, some would say, we attempted to unearth to see what we could find. 

 Anyways, I figure I may need to throw that in there as a bit of a background and possible reason for why I have experienced some of what I have... I've also had another experience about a seance in Plainfield, IL. About a year ago, me and my sisters were conducting a seance in a graveyard near my grandmother's. We had brought candles, my great grandmother's cross and a phone to record; another to play static ""white noise"". We had placed everything on an obelisk-type gravestone in which it had a fancy looking support on each corner. After asking our questions, we decided it was a good idea to just go for a small walk and to leave my phone recording as well as static playing. 

 I'd say not any longer than ten minutes later we returned to find that the youtube video, a 10 hour loop, had shut off. My sister's phone was fully charged, and if youtube is up on any device and running it should not shut off. Fairly spooked and finished, we picked up the necklace and everything else to return to my truck where we could listen to the audio loudly. I'm saddened that I do not have the evidence any longer - long story, but my sisters and I are living proof. Not only had I heard my name spoken in the recording (?) from a female voice, you could hear one of the fancy supports clacking up against the gravestone after we walked away. When we walked away is when the white noise had stopped as well. 

 Absolutely spooked at that point, my sister grabbed for the necklace to discover the cross was missing... It held meaning so we immediately searched my truck, the graveyard with flashlights as well as the next morning - nothing, it was gone. That being said I feel like I'm sensitive, more so than others yet not the most!

 Getting to literally two nights ago... My mother comes home from work at around 11:45 PM at the latest. The time read somewhere between 10:40P.M. & 10:50P.M... My music was playing at a pretty decent volume and an ad came on so I decided to head to the bathroom right across the hall. My dog Jack jumped up with me as usual to follow me! As soon as I turned the light on to the bathroom and looked in the mirror, I distinctly heard a slightly distorted female voice speaking near my mothers tone of ""Hey Bryce!"" It took me but a second to put together what I'd heard. Mind you I have been off antidepressants since I was 12 or so, was fully awake and I'm not ever under the influence of anything. 

 Thinking my music went to an ad, and my mom went to the counter to set her lunchbox down, that was the reason I didn't hear the glass door shut as she came in. Jacks ears shot up immediately as his tail curled in excitement and he took off to go see who had gotten home as he always does. Not trying to be rude, I acknowledged with, ""Hey Mom, its a bit early for you to be getting home. Is everything alright?"" Knowing I heard what I heard with my best bud acknowledging as well and taking off for the front door, he skipped around the house and as soon as it was clear he came back to me. I was standing in the hall right outside my bedroom and bathroom, immediately I knew something was very off. Jack wouldn't leave his beloved mother without jumping around in more excitement on the wooden floors - quite a distinct noise since he is about 50 pounds. We gave eachother a look and I darted for the front door so I could sit until someone got home and try to calm down with a cigarette.

 This is the first time I have audibly heard words, aside from experiencing doors closing in the past (not in this house, only been here a month and a half) and knocking when no ones there. Would this have something to do with the spirit that said my name in the recording mentioned earlier? I'm spooked because I have known - at least believed - that spirit can imitate close or loved ones and that you are NOT supposed to acknowledge the presence if called upon, as it can lead to worse things. I'm looking for others thoughts and input...

 I am an aspiring Pilot with around 15 hours under my belt so far and ground school finished. Aerospace Engineering is my major, and I'm currently in school for my Associates in Science staying at the top of my class. I'm not the most knowledgeable on this field and am most grateful for whoever takes the time to read all of this and give me their two cents! Not sure how much it matters, I was raised Christian but am agnostic in my beliefs. Thank you again for your time and knowledge in advance."
"Sounds From The Basement","Utah","Haunted Places","I've been having a younger friend who is 11, over the last few months and that's when the sounds started. To be honest I'm terrified to be alone at home. The first time was a animalistic growl. The next few times is now animal screams like a mix of a pig and dog. 

Next it's the screams followed with the sound of a chainsaw and voices saying something in tongues. 

It's getting worse and worse every day. The screams and things being knocked over and the three knocks. I feel like its mocking god and me since my name is Trinity. My animals go to the basement with me when I do go but they won't go to the back room where the Holiday decorations are. Before I thought it was a spirit I thought oh it must be a Halloween decoration going off because we left it on... 

But we don't have animated Halloween decor we only use ceramic, gel, foam and plastic. I used a smudging kit to keep it in the basement. But I'm afraid that it's too strong and aggressive. Some nights I will experience just pure terror to the point where I just want to cry and scream. It won't let me sleep, it won't let me live without fear. It feeds on my family's constant fighting. 

I've tried to seal it, I've tried to lock it away. This must be the punishment of what I did when I was a child. 

To be honest I was sick of being bullied and I cut my hand with a knife and put my blood in a glass of water and drank it. It also doesn't help that I do practice witchcraft. 

But my witchcraft is of the light not the dark. Hopefully this isn't all my fault."
"Rhodhiss Lake Demon","North Carolina","Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms","This is not about me but one of my family member. He was a young teenage boy, who went fishing with his friends and cousin one night. From what he told me the sun was setting and he saw something from the corner of his eyes. A shadow maybe? From there I don't know if he felt scare or unsure of what he saw. Finally, coming home from fishing he open his house door knowing that he didn't shut the door but the door itself shut. This is where it started.

 One night may have been bad dreams or mumbling to himself. He told me that he felt a presence or cold chill the first night. The second day he cough out long black woman hair. The third day his brother saw him taking a nap and somehow did a backflip and just stood there with his back bent and hand and feet on both floor like how you see in the movies of possession. Of course it did occur to him and his family there was a funny smell going on around the house as well. The brother and the mom thought nothing wrong with the hair he cough out but they did have their suspicions going on.

 So what really got the family was he spoke a language that his mom knows which was in Hmong. She knows her son is not very good with his oriental language. One day during dinner he spoke in Hmong and said some weird stuff from there, the mom knew it was not her son she was talking to! She said get out of my son!

 From there it escalated quickly to taking him to my uncle house and inviting a shaman to get rid of whatever entity that took over her son! That night at my uncle house they said a lot of ghost or spirit was passing through his body that night. Different language going on and off and different personality.

 The one that really possess him was a demon! It was a woman with long hair. This woman wanted to use his body but she said she will leave his vessel alone if someone can give her a baby or birth a baby so she can be reborn I'm assuming.

 The shaman would not allow it and he wanted to offer something else. The woman who possess him curse him and his siblings that the first wife will have a miscarriage.

 That day he changed but the demon left. When the demon left he remembers everything the time when he blackout and the time she was using his body. Coming home the next day he move the dresser and told him mom, this is what she drew using my body. It was a sketch of a woman in long black hair holding hands with a kid. This explain were the pencil led on his hand that no one in the family knew how or where he got it from. Till this day I wonder was his soul upset to the point he was a easy prey to be possess or he probably got scare and his half Soul left the body and that is why the possession is taking over his body.

 I believe he had a weak soul knowing how sensitive he can be. Fishing at Rodhiss is haunted this is not the first time I heard ghost stories but to see one of my family member getting possessed by a demon I'm sure there is still more out near by that lake."
"I Don't Exactly Believe, But I Can't Explain This Away","Nebraska","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","Alright, so a little backstory here. I have never believed in ghosts or spirits. I believed in reincarnation to a point, but that is just science since energy can neither be made nor destroyed so it must go somewhere when a person is no longer using it. I also have always worked in the sciences (computer science, math and chemistry) since I got out of High School and after extracting myself from the religious cult I was raised in, I became more a person that doesn't discount religion but I have zero belief of any ""all knowing being"", rather that someone wrote out some rules on how to live in a society with other people and came up with the myths to create fear to make people follow said rules. 

My sister lived In NE near Tecumseh (our house is the only one in our tiny town matching my descriptions so I won't give the actual city, leaving maybe 6 or 7 close matches within 45 minutes of Tecumseh), 4 states away from any other family having moved for the military with her husband (she is the military not him) and found herself suddenly having a divorce when she got back from Afghanistan (he was ""sad"" and ""lonely"" and it was only while she was gone, good riddance) so her house was in turmoil and she didn't want to be alone. Being the wronged spouse, she took the house, the car, the pets, and got the mortgage with it. She called me, knowing that unemployment had me underemployed and fed up with my life in my home state, and she asked me to come live with her, keep noise moving around in the house and help her get back on her feet, with the promise of a job in a new career path that would do all training needed on the job with state benefits and excellent pay.

 So I jumped at it, didn't ask a lot of questions figuring that what she meant by keep noise going in the house to be keep her from realizing she is ""alone"" after leaving home at 18, living in the barracks until married at 21, and then living with her husband unless deployed, plus I had the offer letter for the job and knew I could only go up from where I was at the time.

Once I moved here a lot of weird things began happening in her house. I didn't think anything of it, I mean she has 2 dogs and 2 cats, plus my dog and cat so things getting knocked over and random noises are to be expected with 6 animals. Also, she would joke when stuff was missing and say to check the Credenza in the dining room and the servant's pantry as the ""mice"" sometimes hide things there (no she doesn't have servants, she does own a house built in the 1700's and is beyond huge and original and has restored pieces from those eras as furniture). She was almost always right, but again I didn't think anything of it. 

Since I mentioned my sister and the pets, let me go ahead and tell you where we all were at the time this instance took place. My sister was on the second floor sleeping soundly (she has PTSD so she is medicated strongly at night and never makes noise in her sleep but maybe snoring) with both of her dogs who were also sound asleep (and the door leading to the upper stairway was shut), my cat was laying on the couch next to me sound asleep and silent, my dog was sleeping next to the AC grate by the pool table to my right in the basement rec-room, and my sister's cats were outside sleeping in their ""cave"" on the deck. It was a very calm night, no rain and not much wind to speak of, with our little town all tucked in for the night as they get up to work their farms around 4AM (no I am being serious I live in a town that outside of cell phones and new cars you would think was living the farm life from plantation days).

So I am sitting on the overstuffed recliner in the basement, reading a book and drinking hot cocoa; the TV and radio off and my phone was on the main floor plugged in and charging. I was thinking that I should maybe change and work out a little bit as I had been down there being lazy for maybe 2 hours by this point when I heard footsteps up above me. I paused for a second wondering if maybe the dogs got loose from upstairs and were hoping the dog door was unlocked but I didn't hear the steps head towards the kitchen door and they stopped. So I kind of shook it off as being an old house that was settling a bit and went back to reading deciding against working out. Maybe a page later (so 5 minutes approximately) I heard the steps again, but this time they were heavier, slower and definitely footsteps. They were coming from the area of the kitchen door (which we use as our front door) and heading into the dining room. I was kind of frozen as I realized they were far too heavy to be the dogs and they seemed to be going towards where my sister was sleeping heavily medicated and most everyone in our town knows she takes meds at night, so they call me if they need something. 

I closed my book, intending on setting it to the side and grabbing the shotgun from the safe before going to see what was going on, when I heard a second step of footsteps and a woman calling for Winston one of my sister's dogs. It wasn't shouting but had the force like it was supposed to be. It sounded more like someone shouting on TV, but the volume is turned way down. This was followed by a second step of footsteps from the kitchen door area to the dining room. I at this time was positive someone came into our house (you can't break in since no one locks the door, and those that do have several neighbors with keys, so someone can check on the house and pets when you are out), and I had one of the shotguns loaded and was heading up the stairs. 

I opened the door to the basement stairs cautiously, since I didn't know how many were inside and didn't want my dog Fredd who is an Akita (with far too much strength and instinct to be controlled if he feels I'm threatened) to get into the kitchen, and attack someone my sister knew came in regularly (I knew of 1 couple already who had free access to the house as they help with the dogs and he knows the houses problems so he could watch better for structure and electrical concerns then we could).

When I opened the basement door I felt a blast of cold air and the hairs on my arms stood straight up in that chicken skin style which threw me off and caused me to feel abnormally anxious.

 I could hear muffled talking coming from the direction of the hall my room and office were in and the door that leads to the second-floor stairway was at the head of. I couldn't make out what was being said but I could tell it was a man and a woman talking to one another. I also knew they didn't belong in here, because one thing my sister tells everyone that she let\'s come and go is that they are to never try to stay quiet, as it will set the dogs off and wake me up. If they are being quiet then we know they don't belong, if they walk in like they own the place and make their presence known then we will barely notice them. 

I stepped into the kitchen and walked around the island to the front door and noticed that it was completely shut, which made no sense because it is loud when the latch catches and I would have heard it even in the basement (think hammer swinging hard on steel kind of loud), so to keep them from getting outside I locked the inner lock and took the key out (we have a deadbolt and a double key lock on the door, we never lock the double key lock except when we want no one inside so no one has a key to it but us). At this point I was still in the back of the kitchen near the closed doors leading to the servant's pantry and the regular pantry and laundry room so I had 2 doorways and a wall between me and the hall I heard muffled talking in. I could see the only other exit to the house straight through the dining room, first sitting room and mudroom to the actual front door though and could see that it was also shut. 

I realized that they were no longer talking or making noise, but there were no creaking boards saying they had gone down the hall and the dog's barking was muffled meaning they hadn't gotten onto the stairs. I was hoping the electricity feeling in the air had them as frozen as I was feeling at that moment. So I forced myself forward, staying quiet and avoiding the loudest squeaky boards to get to where I could see the hall they had been in last. Just as I reached the door to the kitchen I heard that same, strange volume and all, voice say ""good boy"" like she was talking to Winston, but I could hear him barking like crazy and slamming into the door closed on the stairs trying to get down. I then heard a deep harsh whispering man's voice like it was right next to me saying ""be careful"" or maybe ""watch her"" it was hard to fully make out, but it made me suddenly turn to make sure no one was there that I somehow missed by the door. 

I stepped into the dining room racking the shotgun, to hopefully intimidate who ever it was trying to get to my very vulnerable sister, or at the least be prepared to shoot if they were armed too. I looked rather terrified at the stair door and hall where there was absolutely no one. Not a single person or animal was there, just 2 dogs barking and slamming at the door to the stairs trying to get down, a very quiet snort from my sister trying to wake up to their barking and the air was suddenly calm and no longer electric and honestly seemed a bit warmer too. I couldn't trust that I somehow didn't miss them going somewhere, so I carefully searched the entire lower level, and basement where my dog and cat were awake but calm and alone before opening the second floor to check on my sister. 

I calmed her dogs and took them up the stairs with me, still carrying the shotgun and carefully searched the entire second floor and third floor and couldn't find anyone and nothing was disturbed. I knew I had not imagined that entire nearly 20 minutes, and I knew better then I knew anything at that moment that someone had entered our house, talked to Winston and tried to get up the stairs to my sister who was starting to finally wake up but was struggling hard.

 I guess waking up and seeing me beside her bed holding the shotgun in my hand was a great alarm clock because the second she saw me she screamed and jumped out of bed reaching for the pistol she keeps by her bed (that I had taken when I decided to wait for her to wake up). After she focused and realized it was me, she asked me what the hell I was doing so I told her what had happened and asked her if any other couple but the one I knew had access to the house at all hours day or night. She told me she hadn't given anyone else permission, but there was another man and woman that came from time to time and not let it freak me out. So, I let it go and went back downstairs and returned to my book. 

2 nights later we were upstairs in her room watching TV when I decided I needed more then just being told not to be scared of the other man and woman that came but didn't have permission, because I had heard her voice again the night before talking to Fredd at the top of the basement steps and Fredd ran terrified and would not go upstairs when I did for bed. Also, when I called up to her and asked for her name she didn't reply, and I didn't see anyone at the top of the stairs, but it was dark and I didn't try to go up expecting her to come down.

 So, I asked my sister who these people were, and she said she didn't know, they always came and went since she owned the house (4 years) and the woman liked the dogs but she never saw her. She then said that she has seen the man, on occasion late at night and he didn't seem to like or trust the woman, she didn't come upstairs ever, and he was usually upstairs when she saw him. I was very disturbed by this and tried to talk to her about how that wasn't right (still thinking them to be residents of our town or something) and told her that we needed to let them know they couldn't just come and go without permission, and sure as hell couldn't be upstairs while she was sleeping because that was creepy. She told me that it didn't work like that and to not worry about it. Then she told me that it was their home first and had the right to be there if they wished. 

My sister is a lawyer, and very logical and smart so I just let it go, since she was okay with it. Even though I was not. I asked the couple that knew the house and were pretty much our best friends about this couple. The man we will call Grizz (he is a grizzled old farmer with a heart of gold) told me that when his grandparents first moved to our town and bought the house he and his wife now lived in, there was an older couple that lived in our house. They were very strange, and very protective of the home. They intended to leave the house to their son as it had been in their family since it was built, but he refused it saying he was above living in such a stupid town in the middle of nowhere. Maybe 6 months later the woman suddenly died leaving the old man alone in the house. It was a huge scandal because everyone thought he had killed her somehow and got away with it, so he was immediately shunned, and no one wanted to be close to him after that. He remarried not 4 months later to a 20-something milk-maid but died a year after that and she was found guilty of murdering him by poisoning him. She said she did it for the house because of what it was worth, but she had no legal claim to it and it went to the village. 

It sat empty for maybe 12 years and then someone bought it, but they only lived there for 4 months then moved out of town and never came back but rather they paid other residents to maintain the house. About 5 years after they moved out another family moved in, but they left in the middle of the night not a month after moving in, then another family maybe 6 months later moved in and they lasted almost 4 years, the couple got a divorce (he cheated on her), their daughter committed suicide after saying the walls talked to her and would never shut up, and the wife packed up and left maybe a week after her ex moved out.

 About 10 years later another couple moved in, fixed the place up, lived there for 7 months and she divorced him for cheating on her and abruptly moved out and he moved out maybe a month later saying the house ""hated"" him. He went on and on with the entire morbid history of who had lived in the house, he had names and knew approximately how long the marriages lasted after moving in. He told me that every divorce and there were 10 in that house (11 now that my sister is fully divorced) the wife left the husband and it was because the husband cheated on the wife. He then told me that the entire town refuses to go into that house, but him and his wife unless there will be at least 5 people there, and even then they won't spend time alone in the house because they all say it is haunted. 

I was starting to wonder if maybe the house had memories of energy and I was just mishearing what the woman voice said trying to connect it to my life in the house, but I did not suddenly start to believe that the house was haunted. I did however start to keep noise going or listened to my iPod quietly when it was late and I was alone because my nerves were getting fried by hearing a person I couldn't ever see. 

Then on August 19 I was upstairs with my sister, watching TV and talking to her about work when she said she was tired and ready to go to sleep for the night. I was turning off the lamps in her room when she sighed and said to me ""can you tell him to go away? I am to tired tonight to deal with him."" I looked at her confused and offered to take her 2 dogs downstairs so they wouldn't bother her when she replied ""no the old man, he is standing in front of my bathroom door staring at me. It means she is going to be showing up soon too since she follows him, and Winston will go nuts. Also, he likes to f*** with my blankets. Just tell him to go away and he will leave and come back tomorrow when I am more in the mood.""

I looked into her dressing room towards the bathroom and saw no one. Normally I would say she was seeing shiat because of her Ambien but she was out until we could get her script in town the next day, she wasn't exhausted enough to be hallucinating and she was so certain he was there. I looked back to her and asked if she was positive someone was in front of her bathroom and she said ""no he heard me and headed to the stairs, hopefully he will be gone for the night. By the way if she shows up tell her to go the hell away tonight, she isn't letting Winston sleep and he is cranky all day long."" Then she rolled over and went to sleep and I actually debated staying in her room for the night, I was definitely creeped out by the fact she said someone was going downstairs and she was so calm about it.

 I ultimately decided enough time passed he was probably out the door by now and decided to go downstairs to my office to watch TV. I stepped into the room the stairway opened to that we use as a library and I saw staring back at me a man that was maybe in his late 50's wearing a very old style 4-piece suit. I was frozen, and everything seemed to get really energized and as I registered that I could see the wall through him (he was almost translucent, like looking through gauzy fabric) and I heard that same harsh whisper from the first night say ""until tomorrow"" and he then turned like he was going down the stairs and he vanished. Like out right vanished into thin air. 

I was trying to remember how to think, walk, and was trying to logic this away and just couldn't come up with anything. I decided my sister was going to have a long talk with me in the morning before work, and headed down the stairs. I got to the foot of the stairs and heard what sounded like someone moving around outside the door and I just knew it was the woman I only ever hear, because I felt anxious and I always feel anxious right before or right after I hear her talking to the dogs. So I just shouted, ""go away! No one wants you here tonight, just let us sleep!"" and it felt calm and I didn't hear any movement out there for a good minute before I opened that door. I didn't see anyone in the lower 2 levels and I didn't hear any ""settling"" noises or talking that night. 

The next day I asked my sister about what she said about the guy, about the woman and how she has been around nearly every night, but I didn't hear her talking to the dogs after I yelled at her last night. She finally told me that she had always thought the house was already occupied when she moved in, and initially she thought that the house didn't want her there but her dogs needed the room to run and she wasn't about to be forced out of her home that she loved.

 She made peace with the man after he scratched and growled at her one night and she chased him down and refused to leave him alone until they figured out how to share the house. Then she said she tried to make peace with the woman and she refused to be friendly with her, until she met Winston. Once she found out Winston could hear her say his name and she could get a reaction she stopped messing with my sister, other then occasionally moving things and harmless pranking, but the lady will go on stints where she will keep Winston up for days then disappear for a month or 2.

 She also said she thinks the woman is who told her about my sisters ex cheating while she was deployed. She had found out when she found, under her desk, another woman's underwear just sitting under her desk that she had used not 2 hours before and her husband was at work. He didn't even try to deny it, and my sister says she owes it to the lady for getting her out of the marriage and that she likes the old man and feels safe around him especially now that her ex-husband is out of the picture. 

I am not comfortable saying I believe in hauntings and ghosts, but I am running out of logical explanations, and I don't know how to handle this. If this place is haunted (if that is even real) shouldn't it just be orbs and mists and stuff that look worse then sasquatch photos? But at the same time, I am going to have to somehow get used to this, because it is now my new normal."
"Back To The Cemetery, Please","Washington","Haunted Places","Near my home is a huge, old, lovely Cemetery. Big trees provide shade over beautifully carved headstones. Many of them have military and Masonic symbols, and the oldest dates of decease are from the 1910's. It is a nice, quiet place to be. During the day it is open for the public. I used to take my two boxer dogs there, and go (respectfully) all around. I really like to read the names and dates, and imagine who lies under the stones. I did not grow up in this area, but some of the names are the same as those of local streets and such, so I imagine those were the ""best"" families, in their day. I am not frightened of cemeteries at all. What happened there does not make for a ""scary"" story, but it scared me, nonetheless.

I found a marker which read ""died in France"" and listed the WW1 unit of the deceased. Call me a sentimental fool, but right there I said out loud ""my uncle fought in (same unit) WW2 and died in Belgium, and now he watches over me. I wonder is your soul in France, where you fell, or did you return to whoever put this gravestone here to honour you?"" Then the dogs and I meandered through the rest of the cemetery. We walked home through the humdrum summer sunset.

The weirdness started after dinner, at home. When put outside to do her business, my older dog, Felix, kept barking at the house wall, below my bedroom window. Then she kept barking, inside at the same place, fussing and whining below the bedroom window. Each time I checked, no one was outside. This kept up for several days. The other dog, Leila, carried on totally normal, no barking, no staring or whining.

Then Felix actually started digging a hole, outside there, below the window. She is not a digger dog. So I figured there was a varmit in or under the wall, since she kept fixating on that spot. I examined the whole wall, inside and out, and found nothing to show where mice or bugs were invading. I couldn't hear anything either, and you may know that vermin nesting in the walls eventually make noise when they think the coast is clear. (Yuck.) 

After almost a week of Felix barking at the wall, and trying to dig below it, I yelled at her to stop, in frustration. She looked at me with that reprimanding way dogs do when they are right and you are wrong. I was sick of her nonsense and told her so. (Yes, I talk to my dogs like people.) I pushed all the dirt back with my foot again, as if that would stop her from digging. 

When we got back inside, Felix headed right back to the bedroom and went to staring and whining at the wall. I was going to holler, she was making me crazy.

Then I noticed a penny on the floor, placed exactly beside where she had been digging at outside. I picked it up and dropped it in my front flower bed.

 I was more than a little freaked out by this. I am not someone who wants any sign or needs confirmation of spirits. I use sage and salt, with proper offerings and blessings, to protect my home. Who left that penny there? Until this point in my life I thought of ""ghosties leaving dimes"" as utter nonsense, especially since I have only heard of it from daytime teevee. 

All week outside, Felix kept barking at and digging below the same spot of wall, or staring at it from inside. Twice more, I found pennies in the exact same place inside, beneath the wall heater, up against the wall. I removed them from the house. 

It seemed clear that someone was there. I was afraid to acknowledge how bad the pennies scared me. We're ""they"" inside or outside. Or both!? I lived alone, and it was also nerve-wracking to have one dog keep alerting like someone was lurking outside my bedroom window. The other dog showed no interest in Felix's obsession.

At the suggestion of a friend, early one evening, I stood by where Felix was trying to dig and spoke out loud my intentions to ""head up to that gorgeous cemetery on the hill."" I made sure to say that EVERYONE THERE was heading back with me and how nice it is. I brought the dogs and went along the same route we had taken coming home the last time. When we got to the grounds, I wandered around saying something along the lines of ""the light of the Goddess is stronger than my light, so if you must follow someone, find God's light"" and made it clear that my dogs and I were leaving the cemetery alone.

We did, as far as I could tell. Who knows for sure? 

I welcome any thoughts or comments on this whole strange episode. I will answer all the questions I can-

The dog never fixated on that wall, inside or out, or tried to dig under the house ever again. 

I never again found pennies on the floor.

 I have been back to that cemetary numerous times, although now I keep my thoughts to myself. 

Please note: I have lived off cash tips my whole adult life, and the change adds up fast. I cannot abide wadded up or disorganized money. I won't even carry pennies. More than a couple pennies gets heavy, so I make change by rounding up a nickel. I carry two dollars in ""silver"" coins, as part of my ""bank"", but every single other cent goes straight in the piggy bank after each shift. To be very clear, I think of money as absolutely filthy, and would NEVER leave coins around. I would not want money touching my things, I keep all my coins in my wallet, never jingling in pockets or dumped on the dresser. That is just like having a stinking pile of dirt sitting around. 

My piggy bank is kept in the living room. It is an enormous, heavy, old glass water cooler jug, and I only take money out of it for Christmas (ok, and once to pay the water bill). There is NO WAY there were loose pennies to roll all the way into the bedroom.

Living with two dogs who eat anything they find on the floor is another reason there would never be coins loose on the floor. The whole piggy bank couldn't cover the veterinary operation to fish a nickel out of a dog.

I am one hundred percent for sure certain that no coin could just fall beneath the heater, and damn sure that two more pennies would not fall and land in the EXACT SPOT as the first, two more times. If not for the pennies, this story would be about my dog's overactive imagination and my own tendency to romanticise death in combat, and I would not venture to share it on YGS..."
"Living A Haunted Life","Louisiana","A Haunted Life","It seems like there is never a time where I can legitimately say I have not experienced some type of paranormal experience.

 I grew up in a small town in south Louisiana surrounded by the bayous. The house I grew up in was well known around town for an incident that happened years before my father bought the place. A religious cult had lived there before and a young girl that was a part of the cult gave birth to a stillborn child, instead of doing the normal routine of a funeral then burial, this cult instead decided that they would take the baby's body around door to door to people's houses in an ice chest and ask the people to help pray the baby back to life! Yes not joking, the old people around my town can tell you about it.

 I never knew about it until I was a teenager and one of my friend's mom was bringing me back home one night from a party. She drove up and just looked over at me in awe and said, ""Oh my, you actually live here?"" I suddenly became VERY interested in as to why she would react that way so I questioned her. She told me the whole story, and instead of being terrified to go back into my home (yes I was scared in a way, but I was more appalled at what that cult had done) I suddenly came to understand why I had always felt the way I did there and why my family was experiencing the things we were. 

My bedroom was at the end of a long hallway and I cannot remember a time that I did not run down that hallway to enter or leave my room. Never failed. I would get to the beginning of the hallway and suddenly feel a heaviness around me and I would get a knot in my stomach and start to breathe faster. Then I would run as fast as I could until I would get into the bedroom and then slam the door and suddenly calm down. It's like I felt something was staying in that hallway for some reason. I cannot explain it. 

We would also hear children laughing at times and we even heard a baby crying. Yes!

 My best friend was spending the night as usual and we were just coming to the second hallway that led to my room. My little brother's bedroom was also off of that hallway; his was at the very beginning of it and his bedroom door exited to the right. Well his bedroom door was open (I'd like to mention that he was not home at the time he was with his best friend fishing a few streets behind our house) and as soon as my best friend and I stepped into the hallway we heard a baby start crying and it was coming from my brother's room! Needless to say she and I hightailed it out of there and ran outside and stayed in the backyard until the sun went down and we were forced back into the house. 

It seemed it would only target my brother and I. My mother would have some small experiences but I think she was so accustomed to it that it became the norm to her. My father on the other hand NEVER had anything happen to him. Could be because he was rarely home when I was growing up (he was an offshore oil rig electrician) So he'd be gone for half a month at a time. But it always seemed to like me the most.

There was one night that I woke up to a face above mine, literally about 6 inches above mine, it was not like a normal face though it was more so made of almost a mist like substance I could only make out the remnants of eyes, nose and mouth. I was of course frozen in place and just stared at it. Then it suddenly dissipated right in front of my eyes. 

I would always hear knocking on my bedroom door, open it and find no one there, I would hear my name called all the time when no one in my home was calling me. I would feel hands on my arms or back. It became constant. 

Then one day I met my best guy friend (who is a medium) he is 4 years older than I am, I was 14 at the time he was 18. We began to talk on the phone every day (it was never romantic between us it was a brother/ sister type relationship, in fact we are still very close to this day and my children call him Uncle) and that was one way I could escape from the suffocating feeling I felt in that home. He was the one who told me that everything I was going through was not in my head that it was all real. In fact my home was so haunted that he had a hard time walking into it at times. He said there were over 22 ghosts in and around my home! No joke! The house I grew up in was extremely old and so is the land there of course. Who knows what happened on it before our house was even built, all you have to do is pick up a history book (or Google it) to see how messed up it was in south Louisiana back centuries ago. 

He also told me that the reason why I was experiencing it so much more than anyone else in my home was because I am an empath and sensitive to spirits as well, I can sense them, hear and see them at times. Made so much sense to me finally. I didn't like hearing that of course, but I had to accept it. My friend told me that he would prepare himself and try to help us. He came by the house and he performed a cleansing ritual. Well it seemed like it worked for a few weeks. Then it all started up again. He told me he was sorry but there were just too many of them for him to fully get rid of. 

I ended up living in that house for another 4 years, my father finally decided to move us out of there when I graduated high school.

 I remember the day I moved out of that house... It was the home I had been living in since I was 4. So of course I had an attachment to it. And oddly enough I felt an attachment to some of the spirits there, not all, just the ones who I felt comforted me at times. (I remember breaking up with my boyfriend one night and crying on my bed and suddenly feeling arms around me lightly) so I know not all of them were bad. I remember standing there in the empty living room, crying for them. I felt guilty for leaving them alone again. Will the next people who moved in acknowledge them like I did? I know I sound crazy for feeling that way but it was like leaving family...

Our new place was nice no spirits there at all and it felt nice not to have to run to my room everytime. So I lived a spirit free life for many years. I believe I had closed off that part of me that was sensitive to spirits after I left that house. 

Fast forward 8 years later, I am living in beautiful Washington State, pregnant with my first child (a son) and I suddenly start feeling like I am being called back home. Of course I was missing my family down in Louisiana like crazy. But I was enjoying my new life in a new state with my fiance. But it was strong and I would cry at night and want to be in Louisiana. My fiance suddenly said you know what let's move down there. I was ecstatic and we flew back down here in October of 2006. 

The next month on November 29 my world changed forever... My mother who was my rock, my world, everything to me... Suddenly died unexpectedly. I had spoken to her just hours before she had died according to the coroner's report. My stepfather (my parents ended up divorcing right after we moved out of the house) came home from work and found her lying in the bathroom. It took us months to get the autopsy report back and everything came back inconclusive, they chalked it up to a heart attack. My mother was extremely healthy and thin, no heart problems. So it was a big shock! I always wonder how I knew to come back home just in time. Was it my intuition? Was it something else? I'll never know. But I do know that after that everything changed.

I had a dream after her funeral about me looking into a mirror and pulling a giant nail out of my forehead where the third eye is and there was a gaping hole and suddenly an eye blinked back at me. Yes it was quite disturbing! 

Since then, almost 12 years ago, I have had constant experiences no matter where I live. Every single house or apartment I have lived in since then something always happens. I have plenty more to share with you on those experiences but those I will save for separate stories. I just wanted to tell you about how I was first introduced to paranormal experiences. Hopefully all the stories I share can help someone else believe that they are not alone in their experiences. Thank you for taking the time to read about my early experiences. Blessings to all."
"Talking Mary Statue","Missouri","Children Who See Spirits","I need some advice on what to do. In the summer of 2016, my daughter told me that the Mary statue in her room talks to her. She says that Mary, for the most part, tells her to go back to sleep. Caught completely off-guard, I told my daughter that she should listen to Mary and go back to sleep at night. My daughter continues to remind me that Mary talks to her at night.

I would like to firmly believe that it really is Mary, the Mother of God, talking to my daughter in the middle of the night. However, part of me worries that it's not really Mary and it is someone or something else that has convinced my daughter that they are Mary.

What do I do? I thought about moving the statue to another room but what if she continues to hear someone talking to her? I have seen ghosts most of my life; my parents' house is haunted, but I've never had one communicate with me. Do I get the statue blessed? Could that possibly stir something up and cause problems?

Below is all information I believe to be relevant to the situation.

Our home was built in 1971. We are the second family to live here. The husband died in the family room in the mid 90's from a heart attack. The wife died in 2015 in a hospital, I believe from old age. She had planted rose bushes and daffodils in the yard. I pulled up all the rose bushes except for one (they weren't doing well) but kept the daffodils because she planted those a few weeks before she died (according to our neighbor). I don't like daffodils but kept them for her.

My grandma passed away from a stroke in February 2016. We were close when I was young but because me, nor my sisters, felt welcome at her house because of our grandpa, we eventually stopped communicating. I did not go to the hospital to visit her but did attend her wake and funeral. My aunt told me that Grandma always prayed for all her grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Probably not related but when we would stay the night at her house, she would sprinkle us with holy water before bed so the devil wouldn't take us during the night.

My daughter is an only child. She will turn 9 in October and is special needs. She has a difficult time communicating and uses gestures and unintelligible words/phrases. There are several people, myself included, who can understand what she is trying to say. She is baptized and is aware who Jesus is and that he is in heaven. I did not realize that she knew the statue on her dresser is Mary.

My daughter claims to see ghosts in our house and our friend's house. (She knows what ghosts are from TV and movies: Coraline and Halloween shows) I have seen ghosts also, probably the same ones. She says there's an old man ghost that sometimes appears in her room and opens her dresser drawers. She will yell 'No!' when the ghost bothers her, and he will then leave. I did hear one of her drawers open in the middle of the night and my daughter yell 'No'. I then heard the drawer close.

My husband claims to not believe in ghosts, but I think it's because he believes they are demons and not ghosts.

My daughter does not have much of an imagination. She has baby dolls and stuffed animals that she plays with but they mainly 'sleep'.

The Mary statue is mine. I received it new for my confirmation. It is the typical 14"" statue of Mary standing on the serpent. Draped on the statue is a rosary I received for my first communion, bought new."
"Prophetic Dreams And Attachment?","Ohio","Misc","I've had a few encounters over the short time I've been alive. I've always been sensitive to people's emotions, or I'll have prophetic dreams. They're nothing too spectacular, just a snapshot into the future and when I encounter what I dreamed about (usually a week to about a month after I have the dream) Then I'll realize one of my dreams came true.

Now, this is kind of related to my encounter. I never saw the spirit, or whatever presence was attached to me, but I imagined it was a little girl. I don't have any way of knowing for sure because she's left me now, but my gut feeling told me it was a little girl about 8-9 years old. She followed me around for a good two weeks, almost like she wanted to talk to me, but couldn't figure out how.

She'd been following me around for a couple days when I first tried reaching out to her. I don't remember what exactly I said to her, but I acknowledged her presence and asked her what she wanted. I got no response and went to bed for the night only to have a pretty freaky nightmare of a shadowy figure chasing me through someplace... All I know is it was cramped and dark. (My dreams tend to be vague like that.) I was somewhat lucid during it. I was aware of what was going on, but something else was choosing where I'd go.

Every night, I felt the little girl's eyes on me and it was always from the same spot in my room. I lost sleep over her being there for a little while. Then I had a prophetic dream, only this time, the little girl was there. There was a shop stall of some sort, and I was moving fast down a road of some kind. The little girl was huddled down near the stall, and I was just left staring, my mouth hanging open. I couldn't make out any details of the girl. It was just some sort of blob off to the side, but my gut feeling told me it was her.

A couple of days later, I went on a camping trip with a friend of mine, and I got to know what my dream was about. The stall was actually a grill. The campsite had hired some chefs and they were cooking things like chicken and ribs. We were moving fast because we were on a golf cart. Only this time, there was no blob or little girl. I couldn't help but be a little disappointed. I knew she was there, but I couldn't see her.

One day, I was exhausted. I was tired from school and not getting much sleep, so I talked to her again. I told her she needed to leave and to stop following me around. She left me, and I haven't felt anything like that since. I almost miss her, and I find myself hoping she made it to wherever she needed to go.

I never heard the spirit talk to me, and I never saw her. I just got the feeling it was a young girl. I'm not sure what her appearing in my dreams meant either, or if the nightmare had something to do with her, or if I was just freaking myself out. I'm mostly posting this to get it off of my mind, but I'd like to know if anyone else has had a similar experience."
"Our House Came With An Addition","Massachusetts","Haunted Places","We have owned our home for thirty-nine years, as of this May 2018. Our home has been witness to our lives and all our changes through time. This house I speak of, was purchased by us as a fixer-upper, the best we could afford back then.

The home came with history, built in 1962 by an older woman's family, as she had always wanted a smaller home and they wished her to be happy. Her sons did much of the work, with the help of a carpenter. The problem was from 1962 to 1979, there had been no improvements or updating. If you were to know my husband and I then you would know we would not be happy until all of this home was done over, everything was changed eventually. Then came the deck, garage, three season room and finally a pool.

But for a moment let's go back to that December day in 1978 that the seventy-two year old owner of this home was stopping at the bottom of her driveway, to check her mailbox, before leaving to attend a Christmas party at the Senior Center. What exactly happened next was not witnessed, apparently her car slipped out of gear and knocked her down and the woman was then run over by her own car. Even more horrible was that the older 1960 Falcon was still running high choke and its wheels were turned. It proceeded to circle, crashing through the hedge and around the front yard, and down the driveway gaining more speed, running her over again. It might have happened a third time but for a passing motorist stopping it before that could happen. The small town newspaper gave this information, describing the broken hedges and ripped grass in the front yard.

A horrible event to learn about and naturally we, the townspeople, were all were concerned for her family. I knew this lady's daughter-in-law, we were sort of friends. She told of the woman's injuries, and how she died at the hospital. All of the sons were able to see her before she passed.

We had been house hunting for more than three years, again and again we walked away from the perfect home as it was sadly beyond our budget. We were giving ourselves a rest, every agent in our town and beyond had us down for the next fixer-upper...I think you have an idea where this story is going. We said no, we were not interested when the first call came in April, we said no again a week later, then we said we would just look on the next call, and... Yep we bought it. When we were not even in yet, my sort of friend, raised her voice saying ""what are you a thrill seeker""? We were sick of looking and we planned to fix up and sell, that was really our intention.

I only was able to look at the house twice, and it had scatter in each room, hiding the worst. Also hiding the possibility for me to read or feel anything uncomfortable. Everyone told us how pleasent this woman had been, I began to believe it, and look forward to home ownership. We had lived in a duplex and I had much work ahead, as did my husband. 

Everything that could go wrong, did go wrong. For example we had been told the hot watertank had quit so it was first on our list, calling Sears. We blew out three 82 gallon heaters, and guess who had to mop up the basement, yep twas me! It turned out we needed a pressure reducer, and the water department put it in place. They had no answer as to why now, as they raced out the door, and so it went. 

My husband switched to the hours of 3 to 11 for three months allowing for a work day starting in and on our new home, I helped by picking a different room, scrubbed and painted, washing, everywhere. Much of the woodwork was in poor condition, that made me think the grandchildren were not watched closely. I have the memory of my son sitting on the floor buffer as my husband went over each room's floor. 

We also learned an adult son had lived in the basement. I think he was quite a drinker and smoker, perhaps that was why he was put into an unfinished cellar. It was years before the cigarette smell was gone completely.

My husband moved our spare bedroom furniture first, and he began to sleep there. My son packed and I would move the lighter boxes each day, while we remained sleeping where we rented. Had I been there more I would have noticed her sooner. School ended at the same time we were totally in, finally we could slow down.

I had taken over their old garden and we were given a bunch of garden tools and a rusty rototiller. I turned the soil but had to stop as there was some items under the top soil. Silverware, car parts, rusty things. My son, playing nearby, stepped on a nail barefooted, a bad afternoon and we had many. I could not figure out what this was all doing just six inches under. This was how things were, each time we turned around. My husband and I both lost weight, all the bad things began to run together to a point where it was just all bad. I began to take notes, a book someday I thought.

Our son started first grade, the house was shaping up, we began to have friends over, life was becoming better. I felt her at times though, she still lingered. Had I known of Rook's wise advice, I would have been cleaning the home under his direction, all I did was speak to her suggesting that she move toward Heaven.

I felt she was gentle, in the beginning, a soft kindness. For example, one afternoon my son ran into the kitchen, dirty and so happy. He had found handfuls of pennies where he had been playing, I think a gift for him, unless you can think of a reason why someone would bury about $2.63 at the garden edge. My son also told of dreaming about an old lady sitting on a chair, that was a pretend chair, talking to him and laughing. I considered she may be happy in how we are making her little house as nice as it once was or even better then it ever was.

Then came the late evening where I sat in my living room chair. We had eaten, dishes were done, kitchen cleaned and light off when my husband loudly said ""What are you doing?"" I looked behind and every burner was red hot, even the oven. ""You know I would never do that,"" I screamed back! So much for gentle. Perhaps that was not the beginning, but it was the beginning of what was yet to come. I put this into my notes, wondering what else have I overlooked. 

Having done much in other rooms, we started to replace the wainscot paneling in our kitchen. I pulled the wood under our phone, when several pieces of paper fell from behind. A grocery list, three postcards, and a picture. There she is sitting on a green lawn chair, grey hair in a pixy cut. A small woman, big smile. Yes, she does look like that. How do I know that?

We loved putting our Christmas decorations up early, our son was at a wonderful age. One morning reaching for the oatmeal in the cereal cupboard, I found one of my dancing girls. When in art school I created many of these dancers for gifts that year, I treasured them. Made with blown glass and colorful outfits, a fond memory. Who put it up here? It flew out and away from my hands, I squeezed my eyes shut as it hit kitchen tile. NOT funny... It began to get worse each day. They one by one disappeared, I have yet to find them all. Next came both hot and cold in the tub and bathroom sink. I have read of it happening to others. Now she wasn't even being very original. Little ghost games.

I was alone with my son frequently, my husband had to travel for his job (military). With my little one in bed asleep, she began whispering into my ears. I could not makeout the words, she was trying to frustrate me, and I could not share with anyone, for who would believe me. My notes tell me I cried, I do not remember doing that. I have also written next, she has now been quiet for months.

In the second year I was feeling so happy on a fine late spring day, out in my garden, placing seeds. I was enjoying the birds and mild wind, humming quietly. The garden dirt clear from all last year's rusting metal, life was good. I thought I saw movement, and looked up, breaking my attention. There she was under the oak about twenty five feet away. She was waving, she looked younger. She turned and walked towards the woods, becoming see through more and more until she just wasn't there. Gone. 

I knew one day this was going to be sent to YGS; without all my notes I could not have done it. Had I written more of the lost details, this event could have been far more interesting. I have never in all these past years seen nor heard from her again. I think perhaps when losing life in such a brutal way, a person (ghost) needs time and adjustment. Three of her four sons are now gone, she no longer needs or wants to linger here. I wish her well, and think of her often."
"Paranormal Experiences Related To Mind-altering Drug Usage?","California","Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis","I stayed living in Puerto Rico for maybe 5 more years after my experiences from my last post stopped. And even the first 3 years that I moved here to San Francisco, CA I did not experience anything paranormal. Until I noticed that, after I started having a regular meditation practice and also got a little bit into psychedelic drugs, some other types of paranormal experiences started happening to me. Little things happened here and there while I was tripping or when I was meditating that could be easily explained as the effects of that state, but felt still too attached to reality enough to question if they were actually real or not. Anyway, I think either one or both of these 2 factors forced opened my third eye or something and these are stories of what happened when I was sober from psychedelics or not meditating. 

One night I was struggling to fall asleep, at the time I was stressed so didn't think much of it, didn't even had the sensation of being watched. So, when I got up in my own frustration of not being able to catch my sleep, I saw a figure by the end of my bed, just chilling even leaning against the wall watching me. He was very tall and broad, no face whatsoever as if seemingly made of shadow but wearing a white turtle neck sweater. I didn't even got scared when I saw him nor I felt any bad vibes or anything evil. Judging by how he reacted when I got up and saw him, he didn't know I could see him because he made a little jump-scare and promptly walked away backwards and slowly as if he still didn't want to bother me. I was glad that situation took care of itself and went back to try and sleep. 

Almost the same week maybe the same month, I was having the dullest dream of my lifetime when I usually dream movie worth plots. The 'dream' felt as if I was sleeping with my eyes open, I was just seeing minute by minute of us as we were in bed: my husband spooning me and I was spooning the other me. Wait, what? As soon as I realized that, something or someone I could not see pulled me down with so much force I passed right through the bed and was halfway through the floor; maybe my downstairs neighbors could see my frantic legs trying to get out if it was possible for them. In my desperation I was swimming up so hard that I could kiss the ceiling and then fell back into the other me that was still in the bed. I 'woke' up still swimming up that I startled my husband; but for me it didn't feel as if I woke up because that transition felt so smooth that I'm not sure if it was a dream or if I was sleeping in the first place. I explain to my husband what just happened and he, the skeptic one, suggested that maybe I had and out of body experience. 

The next out of body experience happened some days maybe weeks close after a nice trip I had. There was only one part of said trip that wasn't that great and it was that I got a little paranoid at some point because I thought some things were watching on us, as if waiting for one of us to do something wrong. In that whole trip I would say I was in the realm of the dead and it wasn't a bad thing; thou looking back I would actually rephrase it as I was in the realm of the spirits. In here I had hallucinations or could actually see some weird but not scary monsters, but I still got a little scared because monsters. They looked like Chinese dragons but add trippy changing colors. In the previous days that I was sober, I've been a little disappointed at a dreamcatcher I bought because it wasn't doing its job; so that thought was somewhere in the back of my head. This one night after that trip, I randomly woke up crouching on the bed to intensely mean look at the dreamcatcher. I remember I verbalized my frustration at it and then I was like 'oh here they come!' And the Trippy Chinese dragons came through the room and, as if it was everyday normal thing to do, I inserted myself back into my body. Of course, I was so confused when I came to, but at least I already knew what to make out of it since I had the previous experience which both felt very similar. 

And the last notorious event was a sleep paralysis one and the scariest of my life. Note that I'm writing the most significant events, so I was no stranger to those when this one happened. In between I had some other sleep paralysis easy enough for me to reason with the scientific explanation and not panic when they were happening. But this one, even if I could still attribute it to science, it was just so darn scary and how it happened that I don't know anymore... I was dreaming, this time, of an actual scary looking monster that I never seen before. It was so big that if it were standing on the floor it would touch the ceiling maybe crouch a little, more muscular than a Dragon Ball Z character, with horns and non-human facial features. It was on top of me holding each of my wrists apart with what I think was its hands. And it was screaming... Such a repulsive noise I can't find the words to describe it, I don't even like to remember it but the sound is ingrained in my brain; and it went on for like a full minute. At this point I was telling myself 'just open your eyes already to make it stop' because poor me thought it was just a nightmare. But when I finally made sure I was awake, I couldn't see it, but still could hear that horrible scream. I tried to move to get away but couldn't because there was this abnormally heavy weight on me; recognizing this familiar sensation, I told myself that is just sleep paralysis with the added audio hallucination. When it was subsiding, I noticed that my wrists were apart in the same position that this beast was holding them down in the dream. I want to think to myself that it was all a coincidence, is just sleep paralysis and no actual demon but, who knows? 

I have more experiences that I still attribute to this forced awakening, but they belong in the Psychics & Mediums website than this one. So next time I'll read you over there."
"Demonic Attacks And Disappearance","Georgia","Demons / Possessions / Exorcisms","I will start off by saying I've had many strange and creepy experiences with the supernatural but this tops it.

 A little backstory, the house I lived in was haunted and also had multiple deaths, but the spirits in no way were harmful.

 So in March of this year, I was having a few drinks with my roommates, having a great time. I ran to the bathroom and decided to look into my room. A couple weeks prior to this I noticed a tall dark shadow figure standing in the corner. So I go into my room, and what happens next I have no recollection but my roommates confirmed everything. 

I ran out of my room screaming that the shadow was back just hanging out in my closet. Afterwards I bolt out of the house and flagged down a car and told the driver I couldn't be in the house anymore and that something was after me. After this I took off running to the back of the house, my roommate finally came out to find me slouched over with my head dangling, so he put his hand on my shoulder to get my outdoor motion light to turn on. He turned around for maybe 5 seconds and I just disappeared into thin air, I quite literally poofed. He said I didn't run or walk, I was disappeared without a trace for 15 minutes.

 My roommate and his sister said they heard me yelling and cussing at something all around the house but yet they never did see me anywhere. I finally managed to come to and got violently shoved to the ground. No memory of anything, I have no idea where I poofed to or what I was trying to fight off, but I do know a thing that lurked around my house was about 8 foot tall, red eyes, horns and hooves. 

Fast forward to a week later, I was waking up with bruises and scratches and no idea where they came from. Well that night, I was having a drink when I blacked out (not from the drink, mind you), and when I came back to, I saw blood all over my house. I had been scratched on my nose, but it wasn't a scratch, it was a claw mark. I don't know how it got there or what caused it, I have such a gap in memory of both of these incidents. Very terrifying experience and I'm working on looking into where I disappeared to and why."
"Meeting Granpa Otto?","Oregon","Haunted Places","My pal ""Marco"" had his Grandmama who needed a housemate at the exact same time that I did. The situation was much in my favor.

His 81-year-old Granny ""Nora"" lived happily in the 3-storey house her husband, Otto, had built for their family. Like many older folks she was very set on living in her own home, but much better off with someone to look out for them. I was recently homeless due to melodrama, couch-surfing around. So, I was very grateful to Marco and his family for trusting me to look after her.

She and I got along, as long as I did not pester her mixed stacks of valuable documents and old junk mail. Which truce was brought on by my panic at finding her marriage license and deed to house between pizza coupons headed for recycling.

I enjoyed her feisty attitude and kept the place up as best I could, clutter untouched. I felt positively ""adopted"". Family dropped by all the time unannounced to do chores or say hi.

As was usual, one day when Nora had an appointment to keep, she and her dog stayed overnight at Marco's parents house. It was nice to play my music loud and take as much time as needed for a ""spa treatment"" without rudely monopolizing our tiny shared facilities. I cranked up my music and set everything up salon style.

I left the bathroom door open enough that I could hear the loud stereo from my room. The front door was locked and each window set off the alarm if opened. But folks had keys, and were welcome, so I had propped the door partway closed. Probably with the rug, just in case someone popped by.

I ran the tub. While it filled, I was on the seat, doing my nails. Like many standard baths, the tub was farthest in, next to the toilet, then sink. The door hung on the wall opposite the sink, so I could see out down the hall from where I sat.

Everything was chill. It was late summer daytime inside the house. I was doing my toes, waiting for the tub. Then the door moved open, just a little. 

I reached across the sink and moved it back where I had it. I went on about my toenails. I got in the tub.

The door pushed open just the same, twice more. Both times I moved it back. I could see there was no one outside the door.

By then I was more than freaked out. Except for the occasional cheeky thumping from walls of empty rooms, I had no reason to believe that any spirits were there, or had taken notice of me. This sudden bold move before my eyes was very very frightening to me.

We'd never met before, but I believed it to be either Grandpa Otto or his deceased, eldest grandson. Nobody had warned me for this. This was unexpected and scary. I was not sure what to do. The timing seemed more to be teasing, by peeping and letting me know. I am not a modest person and took no offense if that was their intention. There was no reason to scare me. I tried to reason the movements away as just the house and frame settling.

I shut the door and got into the bathtub. No sooner had I sunk back to relax than something as large and loud as a baseball hit the bathroom door with some force and fell flat to the floor, as if thrown down the hall.

I jumped right up out of the water and tore open the door. I expected to find whatever had hit the door but the whole hallway was clear. I had had enough. It was my day off and I had time to myself.

I said loudly to the thin air ""You are scaring me on purpose and that is mean. You know I am here to protect Nora, with only kind intentions. Your family asked me to be here. Please stop."" 

I shut the door and got back in the bathwater. Nothing else ever happened again in the years I lived there. Because I thought I knew ""who"" it was I was not scared. I chose not to tell the family, not wanting to seem crazy or for Granny to be riled. However, I was respectfully aware from then on that I was not the only one there, watching over Nora and the house.

After Nora needed more care then I could give, her daughter helped me get my own place. I am grateful for their whole family's kindness. This includes my gratitude that nobody told me until years later, that during my stay Otto had been seen reading the paper at the kitchen table, just as he had done in life. Grandpa or no, this solid eyewitness account would have scared me away immediately, especially after my own incident.

As I understand, the home is no longer in the family. This leads me to believe that Otto is at peace now that Nora is beside him again. 

Thank You for reading. This rather humdrum experience is the closest I have come to the dead or unseen, that I am certain of. I have no other explanation for what happened, and likewise no proof but my own senses. It seems this site is a place where even a simple happening like this one would be understood as profoundly frightening and real, and not something I would not care to repeat."
"Someone Was Home","Indiana","Haunted Places","The first time I saw the house I would eventually grow up in, I was about 6 or 7 years old. My older brother by 2 years was with me. While my parents looked inside the house, my brother and I explored outside. Our back yard (about ½ an acre) ended at a wooded area and we had a chain link fence separating our yard from the woods. We met some cows at our fence that were very friendly! I never had any bad feelings while exploring.

When we actually moved in, my mother told me I would tell her there were people in my closet and I was scared. My mom figured it was just my fear of being in a new place. I remember sleeping in my parents' bedroom for a while after we moved in. Then, one day, I told my mom that it was okay, the people in my closet were friendly and I talked to them. I don't remember this!

As time went on, little things would occur: the TV would turn off by itself, lights would turn off by themselves, but nothing scary or even definitive enough to say our house was haunted. Everything could be explained logically.

My parents divorced when I was 13. My mom and her boyfriend would go out a lot and my 2 older brothers were always out, too. I was home alone a lot and by this point in time, I was a scaredy cat and didn't like being home alone. I guess I had read too many ghost stories lol. 

I had been out with a friend one night and my mom, her boyfriend, and brothers were gone, too. I came home to what I thought was an empty house. The house is a tri-level. The main level had the living room and kitchen, 3 bedrooms and a bath upstairs, a den, bed, bath, utility room downstairs. My bedroom was upstairs, directly in front of the stairway, my mom's bedroom was to the left if you were coming upstairs. 

So anyway, I get home and go inside. I turn on the hall light and start to go upstairs. Our hound dog was at my mom's bedroom door going crazy. She would only do that if someone was in there. I assumed my mom was home, but I didn't want to wake her up by knocking on her door. I went back downstairs, turned the hall light off, and could see her light was on by seeing light coming from under her door. I went back upstairs and knocked on her door. Nothing. The dog was still going crazy. I went to the garage, and sure enough, my mom's car was gone. I was too scared to open my mom's door because at this point I thought someone had broken in. 

Before jumping the gun and calling 911 (because I knew my mom would be furious if I did) I called my mom at her friend's house and asked if she had left her light on. She said no, but after realizing how scared I was, she lied and told me her boyfriend had and to just go turn it off. I went upstairs, opened her door, and the light was off! I jumped the stairs and ran outside, refusing to go back in until someone else got home. There was no sign of a break in.

My mom never took me seriously when I told her the house was haunted. I thought I was crazy and would never talk to anyone about this stuff. Eventually, I started finding people that also had experiences and I was able to open up about my own experiences. I am very happy to have found YGS! Thanks for reading!"
"Updates And Theories On The Stalker","Florida","Haunted Places","I have written three experiences on this site about ""The Stalker Clad in Black"". I do not know how many people are familiar with it and I believe not that many, so I will post links to them here:

Http://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=23988 

About two years ago when I was 17 years old, I was having a surge in sleep paralysis and dreams concerning a 19th century-looking man. These dreams started when I lived in New Jersey and peaked when I moved to Florida. Suddenly, the dreams and sleep paralysis just stopped and I no longer hear a chain jingling. Around that time, I had a lot of anxiety and felt mentally weak. I still get some anxiety here and there, but I am much more mentally stronger than I was. I was in a bad relationship and am now in a good one. My past stressors have been replaced with school and job hunting. I am in a much better position and am closer to my own independence, which I am sure has been a major boost in my mental clarity and perspective.

While the dreams have ended, certain phenomena have remained. I sometimes feel gentle pressure on my face or on random body parts like my thighs, hands, back, or shoulder and hear whispering voices in my house. In the past, I assumed this must be an entity touching me, but I do not know if I believe this to be the case anymore. I am older and more skeptical now. The gentle pressure I feel on my skin is probably not ghostly in origin and I believe there is a ""natural"" reason for this, but I have not found any explanations for it online and am wondering if anyone on here suspects what it could be. I assume it would be a form of paresthesia, but I do not know if gentle pressure falls under this category. I do not have an explanation for the whispers I get in my apartment, but I think it might just be my ears receiving pressure and sounds that my brain then interprets as words (kind of like the audible version of pareidolia if this is a thing? Yanny or Laurel?). 

When I first posted my experiences, some users (I do not remember which ones) pointed in the direction of tulpas or pent-up teen energy expressing itself. I personally theorize that much of the sleep paralysis and dreams were natural and ordinary and the phenomena and stress I dealt with when awake was fodder for my imagination to run rampant.

The only experiences I believe to be true were my shadow men experiences and that of the burnt apparition I saw one night. I also believe my mother seeing my doppelganger. Now that I am a bit older, I feel embarrassed for posting my experiences regarding the stalker because I feel like members on here might have been rolling their eyes and thinking ""this child is a mess of psychosis and wet dreams!"". Maybe it was an entity, but I highly doubt it. Personally, I am less open about much paranormal phenomena and ignore anything that happens now whereas a younger me was a bit more receptive. I want to be left alone from whatever lies across the veil, if it is real. I am just glad the dreams are over (now that I am writing about it and alerting my brain, watch the dreams come back at full speed lol). 

Thanks for reading everyone."
"Don't Know If I'm Paranoid Or If Something's Actually Here","North Carolina","Misc","I had to sit here for a bit and try to figure out how to convey what's going on. I can't divulge much for privacy reasons, and it took a lot to even speak up about this. I'm the kind of person who tends to attract spirits and I've been one to visit old mining towns and other ""haunted"" locations to see what I could feel there. And as of late, I've felt the presence of some weird creature and a man in my house. I've only felt the man's presence twice. 

The first time I felt it, he was in the corner of my room watching me. But the second time, I felt him sit on my bed and breathe down my neck. He doesn't have a friendly air to him whatsoever, and the other spirits in the house do not react well to him, including a spirit named Lucy (I might post about her later if I get around to it). I'm unsure as to who he is or what he wants, but as far as I know I'm the only one that has felt his presence in the house. There's also the creature, and it doesn't have a good aura either. It watches me, everywhere I go and its presence often keeps me up some nights. 

I haven't physically seen either of them. No orbs, shadows or anything like it. I've only ever felt their presence. And I'm unsure as to whether they're real or not or where they came from. In May my beloved pet passed away and the grief has been gnawing at me since then, so I think I might feel them because I'm paranoid about my dog's death. Or there's the option that they are real. 

If they are indeed real, is it possible that they either followed me from an old mining town or that maybe my dog protected me from them before she passed? Or are they just hallucinations caused by grief? The only thing I truly know for a fact is that I didn't feel them or know of their existence since May and I'd like it if someone could help me figure out what they are. To those of you who read this, thank you for your time! I'm sorry this is so weird."
"Mindbight Madness","Maine","Ghost Hunting","Hey everyone thank you for taking the time to read my experience and I will participate in the comment section. 

 I told my husband that since it was summertime and the weather is going to be warmer that I wanted to do some ghost hunting. I wanted to do it because the paranormal is both a passion of ours and it's something fun we could do together. My husband said that he thought it sounded like a fun idea so we found a place called Augusta Mental Health institute.

 My husband and I did some research and a lot of really bad things happened there and it really does make me feel very sad when I think about the true neglect,abuse, and evil that took place there. 

The building is still there but nothing is inside the place. Someone does own the place but hasn't decided what he wants to do with it yet so I told my husband let's go ghost hunting at (amhi) before the owner decides what he is going to do. So we go there 2 times. The first time we go we park our car far from the place and walked to the building but we had to be careful, because of Security cameras. We got to that building and let me tell you how creepy This place is just from the outside. Me and my husband tried to get in the building but we couldn't, we did walk around it. We kept hearing a loud knocking noise it was very creepy.

 When you walk around the outside of the place you can picture how it looked back then, it's creepy and the place draws you in some how. Since we couldn't get in we go try to back but this time we brought back packs with tools to try to get into the building.

 So my husband and me are walking towards the building trying not to be seen by the cameras, but then we get caught by a Security guard we tell him that we are trying to do ghost hunting but the guard didn't care and he called the police.

 Me and my husband both have backpacks on with tools in them and now the cops are being called - great good times,lol, anyways the police came. Just one cop and he ends up being really cool about everything and just gave us a warning, and said not to come back for a year or we would be arrested. So for now we can't see what the inside looks like. But it was a fun two nights.

"Loss Of A Dear Friend","Pennsylvania","Family / Friends Visits","I work in the medical profession and have been at the same facility for 30 years. Through the years people came and quit but a constant was a very good friend I made my first day, her name was Kim. She was dependable, funny and hardworking. We became as close as coworkers could get without being involved. I often would sneak up and scare her because her reactions were priceless. She would often tell me if I ever scared her to death she would come back and get even. She did, once. I think because she never lied. She was always one to tell the truth. Then one day it all changed. 

Kim was taking a friend who did not drive to the store on her day off, she was thoughtful like that all the time. The store is located at the bottom of a steep series of hills. A grandmother who had her 3 grandchildren in her car thought it would be a good idea to take the children for a joy ride over those hills for a thrill. Only she had been drinking all day and smoking pot. Taking the hill at 70 mph she hit Kim's car from the back driving it into a telephone pole killing Kim instantly and maiming her passenger. Thankfully the kids were not hurt as well as the grandmother. 

Watching the footage of Kim being towed away still in the car with a blanket over her because they could not cut her out on scene will stay with me forever. Several days of work without Kim it hit me. It really happened. She was dead. A woman who never said a single bad word, nor drank was murdered by a drunk driver.

 About 2 weeks after I was called to work several hours early by the charge nurse. Mainly because of living 2 blocks away and my longevity. We were also good friends and she knew I would come in even though she gave me a cryptic reason. ""We have a situation and I cannot call the police."" I was there by 3 am. We have a very secure building with several protective measures such as codes and such to enter and leave because of residents with dementia, so I knew it was probably not an intruder. The nurse, Mary told me all my staff are accounted for (all women), and a bathroom in the remotest part of the building was showing occupied. Thinking somehow it was one of the residents, she went and checked only to find a blinking light and a woman crying inside and not responding to anything being said to her. We both went straight to the bathroom in question and to be honest I thought an ex employee or current one might be behind it all.

 We got there and it was exactly as advertised, blinking light crying woman, unresponsive. But I had heard the cry before. It was the day Kim had told me she had caught her husband having an affair. But I wrote that off to still feeling the loss, no way it could be Kim. I tried my best to get this woman out even joking the stress of the job had had me resort to breaking down and locking myself in rooms. After about 5 minutes the light stayed on, the crying stopped. Total silence. I have a master key that opens all but a few doors and used it. I unlocked the door to...nobody. An empty ordinary bathroom was open to us.

 Mary only knew Kim slightly and said ""I thought it sounded like Kim."" She was saying what I was thinking. We never reported it to admin, nor anybody else. We would be ridiculed, made fun of or just be thought of as nuts. 

Having met Kim's sister at her funeral I decided to ask her of her opinion. I was scared to do so because the wound was and still is raw. Her sister related a story of driving past the crash sight and seeing Kim in her rear view mirror but was afraid of the same things Mary and I were if she told anybody. Knowing how close we were her sister told me she believed it was Kim. We have since become good friends and call each other if Kim stops by. Which is several times a year. She let\'s us both know by little Kim things as we call them. Flickering of lights when she is discussed, vivid dreams we both have of the same memory. A cold blast of air around that date in July when she was taken.

 I often talk to her at work telling her she should go home. I think she is either confused or unaware she is dead. I know she never had a bad bone in her body in life so she would not do any harm in death on purpose. Unless she is keeping her promise to me about payback. I would like to see her rest, because of the way she died I don't know if that is possible. I miss my friend and love her dearly. I hope she finds peace one day. Having told her numerous times she should go be with her parents and all her old fur babies I have run out of ideas. Rest in peace Kim."
"Weasley","Maryland","Pets / Animals","In January of this year we got a kitten we named Weasley to join my other cat Dil. Everything has been fine, he's a normal kitten playful, rowdy and gets into everything. But lately his demeanor has changed. I know he's sometimes scared of my boyfriend because my boyfriend is a little clumsy and has stepped on his tail and tripped over him and the cat remembers these things. But normally after a few days he comes around and is back to being a little pest to my boyfriend. He actually favor's my boyfriend over me, except for when he's scared because he just got his tail stepped on and then he's up my butt. But moving on recently we have noticed he's not eating as much and he is scared and hiding all the time. He doesn't want me or my boyfriend to touch him. 

Yesterday my boyfriend got him out of his hiding place and sat him down in front of his food bowl to try to get him to eat. He got him to eat half and he went to pick him up to cuddle and try to get him to come around. My boyfriend said Weasley had tears in his eyes, they were so welled up and he was breathing heavily. My boyfriend put him back down in front of his hiding space and he ran away to go hide until I got home. 

When I went to feed them last night I had to sit with him and put the bowl right under his nose so he would eat. I noticed his favorite toy was sitting on the floor (a red ball with a bell in it). I had to get water and figured when I came back up I would try to play with him with the ball. When I came back up I noticed that the ball was gone and one of my boyfriend's dirty shirts was in it place. I thought that was weird, it was just me up there and the cats hadn't moved from their spots. Dil was eating his food by the door and Weasley was curled up against my bed. Plus the shirt was in the laundry basket which was no where near the ball. And for the rest of the night Weasley stayed with me, if I went into another room he followed. He even waited down by the door until I came back upstairs. He's actually been doing that more frequently, he likes to hang out by the door that leads to the main house. 

Also, the other night my boyfriend said that Weasley clawed at him to be picked up and the whole time my boyfriend held him and pet him he said he had his head up looking all around. 

I think there is something in the house messing with Weasley and I don't know why or why Dil isn't affected by it. If anyone has any advise that would be great!"
"Nana Loves","Ohio","Family / Friends Visits","My Nana was my father's mom.

Nana was always the light of our family. She was a mean cook, had a beautiful voice in the church's choir, and was one of the best grandparents around. Having her and her long time boyfriend Robert was amazing. Although Papa, my father's father, passed away years before I was born, I always felt he was still around and often helped Robert with Nana and the children of our family. Even visiting Nana's house, where Papa sadly passed away at, I always felt very comfy. I always knew if something was wrong, Nana's house would be my 1st choice to run to. 

Mid July, I noticed Nana had an oxygen tank. This wasn't surprising seeing as my grandmother, my mother's mom, had one and I assumed once you got older you needed help breathing sometimes or she had come down with a chest cold. When we left her house she hugged me tight and said ""Nana Loves"". Something she told all of us grandkids when we left her house. I told her we'd see her again soon and we left her house. If I knew that'd be the last time I'd see her, I wouldn't have left. It wasn't until years later when I was an adult filling out medical info that I learned she had been diagnosed with non smokers lung cancer around the time she had the tank. 

On my father's 41st birthday, a few weeks later, Nana passed away suddenly. I was told the day before she was at a hospital and was very sick. But being 9 years old and seeing my Grandma in and out of the hospital for various colds and breathing issues; I thought Nana would be out in a few days and back at home. The next day I was called in from outside (back when kids actually played outside until dark) to be dealt with the worst news. She had passed away and dad was coming home. To this day the image of my father walking into my room with his head down low as he sat beside me and let me cry with him will haunt me. I have only seen my dad cry 3 times in my life, this being the 1st time. I wasn't able to go to her funeral as I had come down with Strep... For the 4th time that year. I still feel guilty I couldn't say goodbye, even more so after learning she was cremated. 

Years later I was an adult at the ripe age of 22. Nana had been gone for years and the items I had taken from her house, including a grey bear that I slept with when I spent the night, had lost the scent of her. I was living in a rough part of Dayton in a crappy duplex that my ill father in law rented. At the time he was being nursed back to health following a stroke and other health issues and my fiancé's baby brother and sister were with their mother for the week. So, 90% of the time, it was just my fiancé and I with his little siblings off and on... Mostly on. This night it was just us. 

We opted to clean up the house one night and ordered some food to enjoy what we called a ""Pseudo Mom and Dad night"" (Not to go into too much, but my baby brother and sister's mother is an unfit mother. We were raising them while their father was in and out of the hospital and when their mother decided having the kids for more than a few days was good enough. We at this time were assured she was clean and had a job). My fiancé thought this would cheer me up since I was severely depressed and anxious about how the children were. He also wanted me to have a ""momma"" break. After cleaning up about 20 pounds of toys and another 15 pounds of Goldfish crackers, I told him I was going to sit outside and have my ""talk time"" while he ordered food.

""Talk Time"" was my code for going outside and talking to my grandparents (at this point I had lost them all, my grandma being the more recent one 2 years prior). It gave me some time alone and gave me time to do my way of ""prayer"". I'd sit on the porch and just close my eyes to talk to them quietly. I did this at least 2 or 3 times a month after my grandma passed.

This night I felt pretty down. My 23rd birthday was a few weeks away, I was worried about the kids and their dad, we were always scared due to being in the rougher part of the city, and I felt so down in the dumps. So, I spoke to my grandparents. I chatted up about the kids, what I wanted to do for my birthday (sleep in and have pancakes with the kids for breakfast), how my parents were, and how much I missed them. I spoke to Nana, asking her to give me a sign that my fiancé was 'approved' by her and to let her know I missed her and her warm hugs. After a few minutes I sighed and went inside.

My fiancé was sitting on the recliner and patted his lap to have me sit. I sat down and just sighed. Asking if something was wrong I just shrugged and said that I missed my grandparents and that I really missed Nana a lot that night. My fiancé held me and let me cry into his chest. I rested my head against his right shoulder. I sniffled and smelt something I hadn't smelt in years. Nana's house. Not just the house, but her. I started sniffing at my fiancé like a dog which alarmed him. I told him not to move a muscle as I sniffed around him. It was Nana... But where did it come from? I sniffed the chair, his shirt, his skin thinking he had a new soap. I sniffed the air around him. I couldn't pinpoint it. It was all on his shoulder. He stayed still as I bolted up. 

""You smell that?"" I asked

""No? What's wrong? What do you smell?"" 

""Nana...I can smell Nana!""

My fiancé looked a bit worried but let me sniff him like I was looking for a bomb. I was so happy I started crying tears of joy. After a few minutes he got up and handed me his shirt, and moved a few feet into the dining room. I could still smell her. I smelled his shoulder and noticed the scent was there but faint. His shirt was starting to fade in scent. He just looked at me and rubbed my back as her scent faded. Then it was gone. 

I quickly ran back to the chair and sniffed around it. It was gone. The strong scent was suddenly gone. I sat down in the chair and stayed there for over an hour waiting to smell her again. But it never came back. My fiancé kept the food away from me in case it disturbed my search of her scent. After an hour and a half, I gave up and sulked to the kitchen to eat my cold food. 

My fiancé never could smell what I did but understood when I explained that Nana's house had this warm smell and she wore a perfume I could never find. He understood explaining his great grandma's house had a unique smell that he wishes he could smell again. 

That year for my birthday, my fiancé and I hung out with a friend who did tattoos. Offering one for my 23rd year of staying alive, he asked me what I wanted. I thought for a long time about my tattoos, having planned each one. I had one picked for my wrist for years but on the spot changed my mind on what I wanted to put there. I gave him my wrist and told him what I wanted. 

I walked out with my 1st tattoo an hour later on my right wrist. ""Nana Loves"" replaced my original idea of having 2 bows, one for each of my sisters. It is my favorite tattoo on me and the one I adore more than anything. On my worst days I look at it and smile knowing she always meant it.

I recently got a whiff of my Nana again while my fiancé and I were planning our upcoming wedding. So, I guess that empty seat for her won't be so empty."
"The Door Was Locked","Texas","Ghost Hunting","Half a year ago I lived across the street from my college with my couple month old son and his second cousin. During the summer I had taken a class at the college on the paranormal. Part of the class was to go out and go ghost hunting. Luckily for me the college itself happens to have a reputation for being haunted and one of the buildings was being torn down during this assignment. So I wandered over to the college in the middle of the night with my son. Meet up with some of the employees (my mom works there so I was on speaking terms with most of the staff) and have them take me through some of the buildings. We get to one that's fairly popular paranormal wise and my son who has always been a doll starts freaking out I mean full on temper tantrum. He wouldn't stop until finally we left the building. I got a few pictures of orbs but nothing spectacular. 

During the next couple weeks things started getting weird in my apartment. My son's toys would go missing then appear in the room between me and the room mate while we were talking about it in a place we had both looked tons of times. The tv volume would act up and I would randomly feel like I was being watched.

 One morning I came down stairs because my roommate called me to unlock the deadbolt. 

 Now the deadbolt was set up so that it could only be locked and unlocked from the inside of the house, we both agreed when moving in that we would never lock it. Yet here it was locked. At the time we brushed it off as me being tired and locking it without thinking. That was until the incident happened.

 I took my son over to the college to have a walk and eat lunch with my mom. When we got home I unlocked the door and went to open it. Only it wouldn't open. The dead bolt was locked. My roommate was out of town visiting an ill family member so no one should have been inside the house. My initial thought was someone broke into the house. So I call my mom shaking telling her what's going on and to be on standby at work because I was going to call my son's father to come over and check out the house for me before calling the police. 

I sit outside with my son ready to bolt if someone comes outside smoking a cigarette while I wait for my son, s father. I see him pull up below and at the same time here the sliding of the deadbolt and a click of it unlocking the door. The door was suddenly unlocked when I had tried it a bunch of times before that. We walked through and checked the house for anyone but it was empty."
"Neighborly Ghost","Indiana","Family / Friends Visits","The first paranormal experience I ever had was at 8 years of age. I had been really close to an elderly, male neighbor who was dying of lung cancer. We would always walk around the neighborhood together, but I didn't know he was sick. I was too young to truly understand what was going on and my parent weren't very helpful.

 I came home from school one day and saw a hearse in my neighbor's driveway. I didn't know exactly what that was at the time, but I knew it meant bad news. I ran from my house to his and was told by his wife that her husband had passed away. I was devastated! My parents took me to the calling, which was really hard at 8 years old (not that it gets much easier with age). I remember he was wearing all white and looked like he was sleeping. His wife, to whom I became close to, too, hugged me and comforted me. She told me he was in Heaven and was not suffering anymore.

 I'm not sure how much time had passed since the calling, but I don't think it was more than a month, when my older cousin decided to sleep over. Instead of sleeping in my bedroom, we slept in the lower level of my house (den) along with my two older brothers. Sometime in the middle of the night I woke up and looked over at the couch that was nearby. I saw my neighbor sitting there watching me! He was all white and transparent. He just sat there with his legs crossed like it was no big deal. I was scared for whatever reason and hid my head under my blankets. When I looked back, he was gone. I never saw him again after that. I'm sure he was just letting me know that he was okay. I know it's possible I was dreaming, but I don't really think so. Thanks for reading!"
"Great Gmom","West Virginia","Family / Friends Visits","This was my first encounter with a ghost, and the only one that I cannot say to myself ""well MAYBE it was just this or that"". I know what I saw. This is not a scary experience, so if that is what you are hunting for I'm afraid my story is not for you. It is absolutely true though.

I was young, around 8 or 9, I honestly don't remember how old I was but it was around there. I was in West Virginia with some family as my great grandmother had just passed. We were at my great aunt's house, her house was set up a bit strange as it was not a very big place, but it had two kitchens... One upstairs, one downstairs. We always stayed downstairs as there was more room down there and it had a more cozy feeling compared to the ""fancy"" kitchen/dining room upstairs. My aunt always kept more food in the downstairs fridge, where the upstairs one was filled mostly with drinks.

Anyway, I was given permission to go upstairs and get myself a soda. Going up the stairs put you at the end of a hallway, to your right is the kitchen, left leads to the front door, straight ahead leads to bedrooms, a bathroom, and one little room that was kind of a living room area. There was a small couch, a rocking chair, tv, etc. For some reason I walked straight past the kitchen and stopped in the hallway directly outside of the living room, realizing what I had done, I went to turn around and my eyes scanned past the living room. I thought I saw something and did a double take. Sure enough, my great grandmother was sitting in the rocking chair looking toward the television. I stared at her for a moment before she turned her head and looked at me with a smile, I looked for a couple more seconds before turning and running back downstairs.

I was scared when I saw her, but I in no way felt threatened... My fear came from my mind not being able to understand what I was seeing, I understood what death was at the time, I knew she should not have been there. It is now a comforting memory I have though, as I can still clearly picture her smiling at me.

So that's it, I appreciate anyone who read this knowing that it would not be a horror encounter. I also know that many of you are just dying to know (as I would be) if I got my soda... Sadly, I did not."
"Cemetery Witch","Connecticut","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I'm still around! I thought I would share some other experiences in my home town when I was a preteen. For those who don't know, I grew up in a town in rural Connecticut. The village I live in is relatively small. When I was a preteen, there was minimum to no actual crime in the town. My family lives pretty much scattered through out the village and then in the next town over. And while it was quite a walk, I used to go over my cousin's house pretty much every weekend, because I had nothing to do at home.

Now, for reference, my cousin's house is explained in my ouija story. I would go over there during the day, but almost always go home at night because I could not, for the life of me, sleep comfortably in that house. But that's a whole other story, which you can read on here.

Anyways, My cousin's house is down in the valley of the town. The valley is the home of a man made pond called Knife Shop. The reason it's called such was that it was made specifically to help power a large knife company that once resided in my home town, long before I was born. This knife company was eventually bought out, and as explained in other stories I've told more recently, the last standing building of the knife shop is in my back yard. Though now I'm a tad off topic.

The knife shop was taken down, and a majority of my town is actually state parks, though not listed. As a kid, I used to love going and exploring the woods with my cousins on the weekends. We almost always found an old section of the knife shop's foundation and made a little hut in it, or we played on or in the giant waterfalls that were once used to power the shop. There were many occasions when my cousins and I would be playing in the woods, then follow a path up around the waterfalls and we'd end up in the Cemetery. My town has a very, very small cemetery that is split in two pieces, the old part and the new. We always ended up in the old part. I was never comfortable walking around in the old cemetery.

Onto the actual point in all of this; my cousins and I popped out of the woods one day, around noon, and started to walk the driveway of the cemetery back to the road. Halfway there, we stopped and found a turtle that had been crushed. But it wasn't on the road, it was on a head stone. So we sort of freaked out and left.

Unfortunately, in order for me to get home, I had to walk back past the cemetery to go up the large hill where my house was. Around four or five, I started my hike home. As I was passing the cemetery, I saw a woman standing in the middle of the headstones watching me. She was definitely NOT alive. I could see through her, it's hard to explain what she looks like. She had long wiry hair and a sneer on her face. She was in clothes probably from the 1800s. I actually froze on the grass next to the road and couldn't move for a moment or two. Then she cackled. I stood frozen and quiet for a moment before I booked it. I've got to say that I never ran the mile when I was in school, I always walked it, but I ran a mile, up hill, to my house and got there in under 10 minutes.

Now, in my mid twenties, I go down to the cemetery to pay my respects to my grandparents, my cousin and then I go into the old part of the cemetery to pay my respects to all of my relatives buried in there. I have not seen that woman since, nor have any more dead animals shown up in the cemetery. I genuinely don't know why or who would've done any of that to bring about something as sinister as that woman. I can say very, very confidently, that she radiated evil. And when I walk through the old cemetery now, I actually avoid the headstones where she stood.

This was definitely the scariest experience of my life. Even though I have, more recently, begun to work on my mediumship, as I am sensitive to the other side. I have yet to experience another spirit as terrifying."
"The Devil's Place","South Carolina","Haunted Places","If you're a resident of Spartanburg, SC, you know about Oakwood Cemetery. Or as locals in the area call it, ""Hell's Gate"". This beautiful area of resting souls was once a pauper's field according to local history over 100 years prior to its current manicured field of beautiful headstones. During the day, its a lovely green area full of large headstones and a large worn angel. Past the large hedges, there is the children's field. In the daylight, its fine. But at night, its a different vibes. 

Other than the amped up security over the past few years following many teens and young adults sneaking in past dusk and after a grave robbing in the early 2000's; the graveyard hosts it's share of spooks and orbs. Rumors of devil worship plague the grounds. 

In 2013, I was living in Greenville with my fiancé, *Tyler, his parents, and his older sister. We often found fun things to do, albeit possibly illegal in the state. Between loitering at the Whitehorse Wal-Mart and causing chaos, staying hours at the Waffle House, sneaking into movies at Cherrydale, and smoking the devil's lettuce while carefully watching our shed full of music equipment from the thieving hands of local junkies roaming about; we always found something to do. 95% of the time we spent, we spent it at our friend *Amy's house. 

Amy was and still is our best friend. She's housed many people in her home, all with big, warm arms wide open. Amy was very laid back and always into our silly shenanigans. Through her, my fiancé and I made more friends. Amazing friends! Friends that came up with the idea of visiting the nearly 200 year old graveyard one night.

Rolling into Amy's one night, we were approached with the idea of paranormal hunting by 2 buddies *Eric and *Molly. Knowing we were big ghost hunters in our home state of Ohio, we tagged along for the nearly hour drive.

After stopping for gas, we arrived at the funeral home in front of the graveyard. Molly warned us about watching out for cops and any guards around. After heeding the warning, we walked up the blacktop to the graveyard gates. The 1st stop was the angel in the beginning of the yard. Months prior to our arrival, Molly and Eric visited and took a photo of the angel. Molly and him compared notes on if there were any changes such as movement or damage. My fiancé and I looked around the grounds while they spoke. I felt very sick to my stomach after about 5 minutes. Something just felt so wrong, but I shrugged it off to nerves and being on high alert for any cops. Noticing I was really uneasy, Tyler opted to walk with me around the stones, comforting me and rubbing the back of my hand to calm my nerves. It didn't help but I swallowed my uneasiness and admired how nice the grounds were. (For some reason I'm a big fan of nice graveyards. Too many times they go neglected, so I really love a good, well kept yard.) 

After a few minutes, Molly and Eric joined us. After being satisfied that the angel has yet to move, they led us up the black top trail to head to the children's section. 

""They say a ton of Satanists sacrificed shiat here. They use to meet up every Saturday"" Eric told us.

 My fiancé, being a Satanist himself, quickly blew this off and chalked it up to possibly just being stupid teens with a LaVey Satanic Bible and a cat they possibly caught just to torture. My fiancé spoke about how all these kids don't do their research and only follow Hollywood displays on movie screens. Joking about how kids now a days just think they're rebels by claiming to worship Satan, we walked up to the hedges nearing the children's plots.

 The closer we got, it felt like I was getting a massive cramp in my stomach. Again think it must be stress and nerves, I ignored it. I soon got a huge overwhelming feeling something was behind us. Looking behind a few times, I saw nothing the 1st few times. After the 4th or 5th turn around I got a glimpse of a small black shadow darting behind a headstone. I gripped Tyler's hand and he reassured me its just possibly a big bug or a rabbit or bat and not to worry about it.

Once we went past the hedges, Molly stopped and told us to hush. Stating she had seen something, she stayed still and we all watched to see what in fact spooked Molly. Standing still, gripping Tyler's hand and watching Eric bob and weave to get a better view of the area in front of us; I suddenly felt sick to my stomach and unable to breathe. The moment I felt that I heard, in a very low voice right into my ear a very simple ""Go"". I let go of Tyler's hand and before he could turn around I was hauling down the walk way to the car. I didn't want to see or hear whatever it was again and I was off! The group wasn't too far behind and opted that we leave noticing how pale and sick I was getting. I didn't speak the entire car ride home or the rest of the night. Fearing nobody would believe me I waited until the next day when Eric inquired what happened. 

After I explained what happened and what I felt, Eric said he himself had felt and heard something too.

""Molly and I both saw something on the way to the children's yard. That's why she stopped so quickly. It wasn't a person, it was too dark and misty to be a human."" Eric explained. Telling Tyler and I that later that night he heard noises that he couldn't pin point in the house. He was so spooked after the visit to the graveyard, Eric stayed up all night with his gun in his lap. Tyler said he watched me whine and yelp in my sleep all night after coming home and passing out on the bed. We opted to not do a follow up. 

With our upcoming Honeymoon to Greenville, we've been invited to ""investigate"" again, but we have denied the lovely invite. I refuse to step into the cemetery.

**Sorry if it seems like I rambled a bit. To be honest, out of all the places I've been and places I've experienced paranormal stuff, this is the one and only place I can not stomach to visit again.**"
"My Childhood Apparition","Louisiana","Haunted Places","My ghost story starts when we moved to our house in 1980, Glen Oaks, Baton Rouge La. I was seven years old when we moved there. I was so excited to be there. I felt like we were rich. It was bigger than our old house and we were not in what was like the country. I loved our old place but I was so happy with our new place. I know within weeks of moving in I felt like I was being watched all the time when I was in the living room. There were pictures of all of my family all over the living room, especially on a table that sat right against the wall near the front door. There was this picture of one of my sisters that every time I went through that space the eyes seemed to follow me. I do mean every time. You could not go through any part of the house without first going through the living room. 

This is how it began. That went on for months. I would ask my family individually if any of them had experienced this but they all said no. Of course, most of them cracked wise about me because I felt this thing. My dad was the only one who showed any interest in my concern. I remember my sisters and I shared a room and me and my closest sister shared a bunk bed. It was the beginning of a school year and we were going to sleep. I had the top bunk. One night I could not sleep. I don't know what time it was, but I know it was close to midnight. I lifted my head up and looked the head of my bed and in the dark I could see a man (a full-bodied apparition) in seventies type clothing with a cap drinking something covered with a brown paper bag, standing at the head of my bed. I was way too frightened to move or even breathe. He turned and looked at me and ducked my head under my covers and did not move until the sun came up. 

The next morning I asked my sisters if they saw the man, they just made fun of me. I kept feeling the eyes of my sister's photo watching me and seeing this man every night for a couple months. I could not get sleep to the point I finally talked to my dad, despite the fear of him teasing me like the rest of my family did. Surprisingly, he did not tease me but he understood because he was experiencing something n the house too. He would never go into detail but when I described the man to him he knew I was telling the truth. He made the decision for him and me to get up early the following morning, about 3 am and went into the living room and prayed. Being young, I prayed for about 3 minutes and fell asleep on my knees at the couch. My dad, however, prayed the whole time. I don't know what he prayed but after that morning, I never saw that man or felt the eyes of the photograph follow me again. The house was peaceful and felt like home. That house stayed in our family until February 2018."
"The Little Demon Girl","Florida","Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations","I've always been spiritually active, ever since I was a little girl to be honest. I assure you it wasn't by my own choice, I wouldn't wish this on anyone. I've attracted all sorts of spirits, but the main ones that seem to want to get closer to me have been Demons; as you can already assume, they aren't the nicest of people around. The house that this happened in was near Daytona, and I still live there to this day. While I'm not sure who will believe me, I'm hoping someone can give me a clue on what's going on and how this could have possibly happened.

When we first moved here, to say the least I got a bit of an odd feeling from the place. I was right and have had plenty of odd experienced here, however this one takes the cake. As you know, I've always been spiritually active, the same goes for me being an empath and Clairsentience (basically Clairvoyant but instead of seeing, I feel) and I easily pick up on bad or evil feelings. In my room, my bed is against the wall but straight across from the end of my bed there is a wall where there are two doors separated by computer desk. One of those doors leads me out of the room, while the other is my closet.

I don't have any curtains in my room (I have two tall windows on the wall that the top of my bed faces) and suffer from horrible migraines that literally make me feel like I've been hit by a bus full of elephants and hippos. My closet is a small walk in closet, but it's big enough for me to lay down in. I made a bed and everything for when this happens so that I have a place where I can sleep in complete silence and darkness, but I noticed that I started to feel a little uneasy whenever I went near my closet. It wasn't the smartest idea that I've ever had, but I would always brush the feeling off as my mind playing tricks on me since I would constantly watch scary things just to give myself a few jumps. However, it got worse when I would be laying down in the closet (with or without a migraine) and would feel sick.

I would get so sick that I would almost throw up, and I'd only start to feel better once I got out of the room. Assuming it was just the pain or me catching a virus, I would still try to sleep in the closet. It wasn't until the big event happened that I realized just how stupid I was. Once, I had a pretty bad migraine and I went to lay down in the closet like I normally would. I was laying on my back and doing my best to fall asleep with the help of some medication. When I feel asleep, I wasn't so sure, but when I woke up something was off.

I woke up on my stomach with my face in the pillow, now mind you while I do move in my sleep, I've never woken up with my face IN the pillow instead of on my arms. I'm a big person, so I often times use my arms or my chest as a pillow depending on where I am. I heard child like laughter and panicked, while I could move the rest of my body a little, I couldn't seem to move my head. I could feel someone pushing my head into the pillow and trying to suffocate me. The harder I tried to move, the harder it pushed. I could tell from the shape and the size of the hand, it was similar to that of a little child.

Putting the last of my energy into one final push, I was finally freed from it's hold and ran out of the closet and into the living room. I stayed there for a remainder of the day, much to my family's confusion. My family would never believe me if I told them the story, so I wasn't going to attempt it. It seemed like that would be the ending of my experience with the thing, but I could feel it just standing there watching me.

Focusing on it, I got a picture of what they looked like in my head. It was a little girl with an naturally big smile and large black eyes; she had peach skin and dishwater blonde hair that looked like it could use a good wash, no shoes, and her little white dressed was covered in dirt and grime. She's still in my closet and sometimes I can hear her laughing and beckoning me to come sleep in the closet again, and keeps saying that she won't hurt me.

I know that's a lie.

To make myself feel better I always like to say that this would make a really good CreepyPasta, but I can't go in my closet anymore. Not without the door staying open and it being during the day, I keep my cross and my bible close to my bed too. I don't know what to do, but cleaning the house only seems to keep her bound to the closet, but whatever it takes to keep her away from me, I guess. If you have suggestions on her to get rid of her, by all means tell me, if not, I plan to leave her where she is for as long as I can."
"Boyfriend Thinks He's Talking To Me","Maryland","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","Back again! I've been extremely busy and haven't had time to post. But since I have some down time I figured I would squeeze in a story!

About a month ago I was downstairs doing something in the kitchen (can't remember what) and I heard and saw my boyfriend go upstairs. I finished what I was doing in the kitchen and went upstairs as well. When I get up there my boyfriend has this look on his face and said ""I have to tell you what just happened."" I told him OK. He said he was walking up the steps and thought I was up in our room feeding the cats since it was time for them to eat (8:00 pm). He yells up, ""Hey babe are you feeding the cats?"" and he heard clear as day ""Yes"" in a women's voice. Again he thought it was me because he thought I was up in our room. He rounds the corner and there is no one there. Mind you there is nowhere for me to have been able to hide. And then of course a few minutes later I come up the steps. 

This isn't the 1st time we have heard people speaking who weren't there. And we normally hear it upstairs but there have been other occasions where people have heard someone speaking in other parts of the house. And it's usually a women's voice. We have our speculations of who it could be. It could either be my Grandmother or my Mother. They both died in 2017 and I feel that the amount of times we hear a woman speaking has heightened. Granted we heard voices before they both past but it has escalated more since their passings. 

I hope you enjoyed this little story I had to share. Once I have more time I will write about the other experiences we have had. Please feel free to leave questions and comments."
"He Read My Facebook Posts","New York","Family / Friends Visits","A friend from college recently passed. I'm a relatively young guy mid-30s and haven't really experienced a loss like this before. This was someone who I hung out with pretty consistently at one point in my life, so it hit me more than I thought. 

These days there are a lot of new ways to remember someone in the age of social media. It's so new for this generation so the rules aren't properly defined. Could be a photo posted, could be a quick story on someone's facebook page or it could be something as simple as responding to a shared RIP notice. 

As is custom these days, I decided to post a tribute on Facebook and Instagram for him. I found an old photo of us and wrote something nice about him and about the activities we used to do together. But just as I was about to doze off thinking of something else, I heard my deceased friend's voice, saying my name, clear as a bell in my head. Didn't sound like it was in the room, just in my head. He said my name matter of factly, no tone or emotion that I could detect. And that was it. 

I shot up like a bolt in bed. Looked around and nothing physically looked off, so I went back to sleep and this time dozed off. 

He never had physically been to my house and besides talking on facebook I hadn't seen him in 6 years. But I do think it was him. I think it was him in spirit coming to say a quick goodbye and acknowledge that he'd seen my posts and got the message. What do you guys think? Has anyone ever experienced a spirit/ghost responding to something that was posted about them? Would this be possible?"
"Death Of A Friend But Not The Friendship","Georgia","Misc","I'm reaching out, due to confusion-- I need help with clarity.

I dated a man off and on from about 2002 to 2006. The relationship was more of a loving friendship, rather than romantic. Whenever I needed him-- he was there and vice versa, though, me being a single woman in Atlanta at the time, I called on him more. 

After a while, I began dating someone seriously and Christian (not real name) and I lost touch, but with social media we linked up via MySpace around 2008 or 2009, I believe. We chatted and he expressed that he'd been searching for me and was elated to have found me on the social media platform; however, Facebook came along and I abandoned that account and again lost contact with Christian.

Last year in 2017, I began to feel an urgent need to speak with him, but couldn't locate him anywhere. I was in dire straits. I looked up his business, which was now defunct. I searched his name and city-- nothing. So, after a few weeks of looking into finding him, I gave up.

Last week I was looking through my jewelry and became fixated on a Tiffany's necklace he'd bought for me, so of course, I decided to begin my search again and this time I found him-- his obituary came up-- he died weeks ago. There was no cause of death in anything I read, but from the condolences page, it seems it was sudden.

I am lost right now and confused. I don't understand how with everything available that I couldn't find him. Do you all think that last year I had a hunch regarding his passing (I am an empath). Or was he possibly searching for me too? Was the necklace a coincidence? 

My clarity is warped right now. Any advice would be appreciated."
"Knock At My Door","California","Misc","Since I have been living at this motel in Ontario, I have had knocks at my door at different times at Midnight and 2am.

When I look through the perp hole, there's no one there.

The knock is always the same way.

It's a weak knock that can be identified as either a child or a woman's.

It never happens during the day.

I am usually alone when it happens, but yesterday at Midnight my son is with me and he heard it too.

He got up and looked through the peep hole no one was there.

There was one time when I was alone, it was at 100am and that knock came and it was a woman who knocked because she said hello.

It was only a matter of seconds from me getting up to look through the peep hole and the knock and the voice saying hello, when I looked there was no one there.

This has happened at least 3 times a year and I have been there almost 5 years.

Since this place is always busy so when it first started happening I didn't think anything of it cuz I just thought they had the wrong room.

There is a lot of young kid partiers and homeless. 

Since we have had quite few visits from the police and paramedics, I thought it was due to all the people who either OD or have died.

Those incidents are no where near my room.

I do not open the door ever.

I know about certain things to watch out for.

I used to listen to Coast to Coast and they said at one time, people will get a knock and there would be children with Black eyes and want you to open the door so they could stay there with you and haunt you, but I have never seen them or anyone standing at my door after a knock.

It only happens once in a day, it doesn't come back a second time that day.

Anyone have a idea what I keep experiencing?

This isn't a new accurence, has happened in every place I've lived."
"My Dresser Has Something Bad In It","New York","Haunted Items","So I got my dresser a year ago from my now ex sister in law, she and my brother are wiccans and I did not think anything of it, to each their own. It's a beautiful dresser made of a dark hardwood anyways back to my story. 

My mom hates coming in the back of the trailer it gives her the ""heebeegeebees"" so I put up a blanket for a wall, thinking maybe that will help but she still got the bad feelings.

 So every now and again something strange would happen my fathers pc would turn on or my lights flicker when everyone is asleep but the creepiest things been happening lately. 

Yesterday I took a picture of the inside of my dresser it had 4 or 5 orbs inside it, took another pic right after nothing.

 Today I wake up little early and I look at my dip tin tower it got knocked over (my cat likes to jump up on top and sleeps, no problem I put it back up couple minutes later). Something then took a tin out of its place and it fell. My brother, mother, and father were making some tv stand and my cat was asleep in my brother's room so I ignore it and this time a empty tin flew at me almost hit me in the head. 

So I say f*** it I'm putting it back together and I find a unopened tin (I don't add full tins to my tower because I will forget about it).

So I go out for a bike ride come back, take another couple sets of pictures and saw another orb in my room and once again it was gone in the next picture. Later on I am in my room watching tv on my phone yes I know why not just use your television set I don't have an antenna in my room so and I felt a burning scratch appear on my face."
"I Don't Think I'm Alone Anymore","North Dakota","Orbs / Lights / Mists","Over the last couple of years I have started to experience possible paranormal activity in my home. So far it hasn't been anything that seems to be threatening but I've just been having more and more strange feelings and experiences. Since the last time I published a story on this site my security camera has caught a few more things that were strange, mostly in the form of weird lights and ""orbs"" moving around the room. Most of which I determined are most likely dust or reflections from passing vehicles but there have been a handful of them that I truly cannot explain. 

Besides that I've been hearing more odd noises in my house at night. Anything from hearing footsteps in the hallway to hearing what sounds like a door being closed somewhere down the hall from the bedroom. But as usual when I go to investigate it I find nothing out of place and all the bedroom doors are still open.

 But by far the strangest activity that has happened in the house happened just a couple days ago. A friend came over to my house to use my printer because his is broken. He was upstairs in my office while I was downstairs in the living room watching tv. When he came downstairs he stopped dead in his tracks and was just staring at me with a weird look on his face. I asked him why he was looking at me like that and he asked how I got downstairs. I told him I have been in the living room the entire time and I have no idea what he's talking about. He told me that just before he came back downstairs he saw someone quickly walk by the doorway to the office and into my bedroom, which is impossible since we were the only ones in the house at that time and for someone to get into the house they would have had to walk right past me in the living room. I asked him if it looked like me and he said he wasn't sure, he said the figure went by the door quite fast and he wasn't able to really make out any features. I should mention that my friend 100% does not believe in the paranormal and he still swears that I was messing with him which I absolutely was not.

If anyone is interested in looking at the video footage that has been caught by the security system the link to the latest video is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2u7tpAs4Z0. Leave a comment and let me know what you think. Is it just dust or some sort of insect or do you think there is more to it?"
"Electrical Phenomenon?","Oregon","Misc","This isn't a ghost story, but I'm wondering how many contributors here regularly experience electrical problems & if it's connected to being ""open"" to things of this nature. As I've said in the past, I always try to debunk something before declaring it paranormal. But this is getting annoying. And expensive. Light bulbs don't seem to last a month around me (even the ones touted as ""long life""). Brake lights & turn signals go out regularly. My cell batteries also seem to drain quickly, and this has varied brand-to-brand over the years. The streetlights by our house have never seemed to work right or be reliable. I have to change the batteries in my keyboard & mouse at work about once a month (coworkers claim theirs last six months or more). 

The first time I noticed this might be a me-thing was in the year 2000. My boyfriend & I had just moved into a brand new apartment building in southeast Portland - we were the first tenants in our particular unit (hurray - no weird crumbs under the fridge!). One Sunday evening, I was boiling some pasta on the stove in the kitchen, he was watching TV in the living room. I wandered out into the living room & we got into an argument about something. It became heated with me raising my voice (I have quite a temper), and with my shouting - the electricity went out. Everything. I went to the fuse box to see if something blew there, and I couldn't find anything that looked out of the ordinary. I regularly blew fuses drying my hair, so I was familiar with this happening on a smaller scale. I went out into the building's hallway, and the lights were still on elsewhere. I'm annoyed, so I make a call to after-hour maintenance. 

Maintenance staff at that place was less than friendly... I dreaded calling them, but this couldn't wait. The guy shows up to our door, cranky that we'd interrupted his day off. ""Well, did you check the fuse box?"" Of course we did. He shakes his head, checks it himself, ""Doesn't make sense."" He starts getting more agitated, asking if we'd been running the kitchen fan, heater, vacuum, microwave, had all the lights on at once, etc. - we'd only had the kitchen light on, one burner on the stove, TV, and a lamp in the living room. Hardly anything extreme, especially for a newly constructed building. The maintenance guy doesn't believe me, and storms out to check the building's main breakers. 

He returns about 10 minutes later, still agitated. ""Are you SURE you weren't running a vacuum and the heater at the same time? You must've been doing SOMETHING in here! You blew out the main ___ (something or other technical term I don't remember nor did I understand at the time)!"" Oddly, it had only affected our apartment - no one else's - and apparently it was a real pain to fix. He had our electricity back on within an hour & I was happy. Maintenance dude was not. It did stick in my mind though, that when we'd began arguing, that's when the power went out. 

A few weeks went by and we had started an argument about something else. The lights flickered. They ALWAYS flickered whenever we argued after that, even after moving. I started noticing we went through lightbulbs like crazy, having to replace them every few weeks. I've moved house five times since that one big power blow-out and no matter the age of wiring, which lamp they're in, brand of bulb - they always crap out before their time. 

Most recently, the bathroom lights have been exploding on me. We have one of those recessed bathroom fans, with lights on either side. Three times in the past six months, I've gone into the loo & one of the bulbs in the ceiling goes POP! Luckily the bulbs are protected by a glass slide-y thing, but it shatters the entire bulb... Making it a mess to clean up. A couple weeks ago I was in an argument with my other half. I slammed the front door to have a smoke outside, the porch light popped & went out. Not the first time this has happened, either. It almost always seems to happen when I'm upset or annoyed. 

I've done a couple of quick searches on the interwebs and all I can come up with are ""sliders"" or ""SLIders"", which seem to pull energy from electrical sources. I have yet to find a reputable-looking site with a logical explanation. Do you guys experience this also? Suggestions?"
"The Fan","California","Haunted Places","So roommate A and I entered our dorm room around 9:15 PM right, the lights were off, the room was cold, you know, how it usually is. Except something was different. There was a faint whirring near roommate A's bed. Upon walking over, we realized the fan was on and my mind immediately went to roommate A. She was the last one in the room, but when I asked her she told me she did not turn on the fan or go near it. (Plug in fan btw) I don't know if she's lying, but let's just assume she didn't turn it on. The door to the bathroom we share with suite mates was locked and the cleaning was done yesterday, so no one could have come in our rooms. Plus, everyone was downstairs partying anyways. After we checked the doors and closets in case anyone snuck in, there was a weird tug at the door and we both booked it out into the hall.

Roommate A later confessed to me she had heard knocking at the doors sometimes, and before this incident, she told me she has a ghost that follows her around. But, she doesn't think this was her ghost's doing because her ghost has never turned on a fan. There is a rumor that our hall and the hall above ours is haunted, and my friend was just telling me today how weird stuff happened in her dorm on the fourth floor too (books falling over, doors closing suddenly). I should also mention we were talking about paranormal stuff two nights ago (could we have invited some negative energy in the dorm?) and last night my shaving cream can began foaming randomly as if the top was broken. I don't know if this has anything to do with what just happened, but it's worth noting I think. Honestly, I'm not really scared because I don't feel any negative presences or have chills but who knows. We're also keeping this from Roommate B because she gets spooked easily: 

 Anyways, any insight would be amazing! This is @bearscary signing off..."
"Noises And Unexplained Happenings In Old Victorian: Year 2","Massachusetts","Haunted Places","This is a continuation of my previous story about a home in which I rented a room for 3 years. The first year, I was on the first floor. The second year I was on the second floor, the one where I had previously been hearing footsteps up and down the stairs. The second floor of the house and the attic had a total of 6 rooms to be rented, so there were 6 of us living there together. 

To recap, the home was an old Victorian built in 1890, originally a one-family home that had been separated into two units, one consisting of the downstairs and the other of the upstairs and the attic. There were two doors in the front of the house from the porch, one of which led into the downstairs closet and the other opened onto the stairs to the second floor, with a partition wall between them. 

I had been upstairs once before during the previous year but it was not until I began moving my belongings upstairs that I noticed the upstairs had a completely different vibe. The front stairwell, which went up about 10 stairs, stopped at a small landing, and then veered left with another four stairs, was dark and creepy, and even though the walls were white and there was a window at the landing, the paint was chipping and the whole area felt very dark and ominous. The stairwell was narrow and due to the partition wall constructed to the left, the whole area felt claustrophobic. Much of the activity I had heard the previous year, while living downstairs, seemed to center on this stairwell, which was loud and creaky. Standing at the bottom of the stairs looking up filled me with dread and sent chills up my spine, but I developed a weird fascination with this area in the house. I often took photographs of myself on the stairs, playing with the lighting to give myself a ghostly vibe. 

At the top of the stairs was a small hallway with four doors. The one immediately to the right led to a bedroom, also accessed from the upstairs living room, and corresponded with the ""closet"" door directly downstairs that I had kept closed the entire year due to feeling watched from behind it. The door immediately in front led to the living room. The next door, moving left, had no doorknob and was sealed shut, and led to another bedroom which could also be accessed from the living room. The door at the end of the hallway led to a small bedroom in the front, and immediately to its left was a continuation of the stairway which led up to the attic. There was no door, and the stairway was open. It was incredibly narrow with the steps' paint chipping, and walking up it, one had to duck downward to not hit their head on the wall. The living room was painted in a dark crimson color with black wooden floors, and there was a kitchen toward the back of the house that had a door in it leading to the back stairwell which lead directly outside and, also to the basement. The light in the upstairs hallway was not turned on with a switch, but by a motion censor. 

Over the course of the year, I would often think about, dream about, and even draw pictures of the staircase. It was always on my mind, and I do not know why. I had no interest in architecture nor in interior design, but this staircase would often find its way back into my mind. 

The room I lived in upstairs was directly above the one I had lived in the previous year. The very first night I stayed in the house, I stayed up late watching movies in bed, and I noticed light shining underneath the door that connected to the hallway at the top of the stairs. When it turned on, it caught my eye. I did not hear any movement in the hallway nor any footsteps. I was the first person to move in, and everyone else would be arriving over the next 3 days. I quietly got out of bed, locked both of the doors to my room, and sat back down. Within a few minutes, the hall light went out. Over the next year, I would experience this very same thing when I know for a fact I was either the only one home, or no one was in that hallway. I would often be sitting in the living room talking to my roommates, and suddenly the hall light would turn on, activated by the motion detector. It would always puzzle and startle all of us, but everyone else turned a blind eye to it, convinced it was an issue with the wiring or with the motion detector itself. The door would be open to the hallway and we would not see, nor hear, anyone there. This continued periodically for the whole year. 

I worked a late night shift in the game room on the college campus I attended and coming home at midnight, opening the front door, I would often feel dread climbing the stairs at night. I felt as if something I could not see was standing at the top of the stairs ready to stick its head around the corner and jump out at me, or was glaring at me. I never could physically see anything there. When I reached the landing, I often felt the energy move toward the portion of the stairs leading to the attic, and felt the temperature drop. My roommates attributed it to there being a window right there, but I know it was not that. Other nights, just as I heard from downstairs, I would hear footsteps pacing up and down the stairs, followed by a sound that resembled a ball being dropped from the top stair, bouncing to the bottom, hitting the front door, and trailing off as it came to the end of its bouncing. 

My other roommates heard these noises and assumed they were me going outside for a cigarette every half hour. I would not have dared get out of bed with these noises occurring!

Between the kitchen and the living room was a small hallway that had two doors, one was a bathroom and the other opened to another small staircase also leading to the attic. Late at night I would go to the bathroom and distinctly remember this door to the attic being shut, but upon exiting the bathroom, it would be slightly cracked. I would never open or look behind it, I would simply shut the door and run back to my room. Despite heat rising, I often felt chills when the door was cracked. A few instances while in the bathroom, I would hear this doorknob turning followed by the creaky sound of the door opening, but no footsteps from any direction. 

The whole upstairs had a very distinct smell that I cannot describe and have never smelled anything similar. If you can imagine a weird mixture of cedar, expired milk, and mildew, that is the best I can describe it. This smell was strongest in the kitchen and on the back stairwell. That back stairwell scared me even more than the front one. Due to my work schedule, I would often come home from work late and eat a small snack in the kitchen before heading for bed, and I would hear the loud ""click"" of the light switch for that staircase, followed by a heavy THUD, THUD, THUD up the stairs. I never heard the door open from outside, so I knew it was not my roommate coming home. The footsteps radiated across the kitchen and I could feel their vibration on the floor. When this happened, I would turn off the kitchen light, hide in the hallway, and watch. The door would slowly creak open, but nothing entered the kitchen and the footsteps did not continue forward. I snuck back to my room and locked the door, and would not get up again for any reason.

To make matters worse, the washing machine was at the top of the back stairs on a landing, so I absolutely dreaded doing laundry. I refused to go on that staircase at night. The walls and floors in that area were a sickly dark green color, and the light was very dim, so every time I would be doing laundry with my back to the stairs, I felt as if something was going to jump out and grab me. I never felt alone when I was there. About halfway through my lease, the light in that stairwell simply stopped working. At first we tried replacing the bulbs, but it was not this. It turned out that for 5 of us living there, the lightswitch simply would not work. It only worked for one roommate, and only that one person, and not when anyone else was watching them use it. After that roommate moved out halfway through the lease and sublet his room to someone else, that lightswitch never worked for anyone else. We called an electrician and they could not determine, from looking at the wiring, that there should have been any issue with the switch. There was nothing more dreadful to me than doing my laundry in the dark. 

While all of my roommates heard these same noises, they sought alternative explanations. My feeling of being watched, they attributed it to paranoia. The noises on the staircases they believed were one of the other roommates coming or going to either retrieve items from their car or to smoke cigarettes, even though everyone insisted that they did not make the noises and were not going outside. No one, at least yet, admitted to having any experiences. 

One roommate, though, would be the first and only one to actually admit to *seeing* an entity in the house. One day I was sitting in my room reading and I heard pounding on a door. It sounded as if it was coming from the back door at the bottom of the back staircase, but I looked out my window and saw no one there. It was coming from the basement. I mustered up my courage and ran down the back staircase to hear my roommate's voice from behind yelling ""LET ME OUT! LET ME OUT!"" I would then find out that this roommate tripped the circuit breaker with his space heater, and went down the back staircase to the basement to turn the breaker back on. I had never been in the basement but this roommate said that the door would not open for a good several minutes and the knob was jammed. After much struggle, the basement door opened and the light was already on. While downstairs, he said he, too, felt as if there was something watching him, but he could not see anything at first. He said he felt as if in each corner of the basement was someone standing there glaring, with eyes in all different directions centered right on him. Eventually he found the breaker and flipped it back on, but the basement light itself went out. The only light was from the top of the stairs where there was a small amount of light being let in from the window on the top of the door. All of a sudden, something dark and black flashed past the top of the stairs and the basement door slammed shut, trapping him inside. That is when I heard him shouting and banging on the door. 

That day he, too, admitted to hearing strange noises in the house, including ones I did not hear. He said that while he was sleeping, he would often be woken up at 3 AM by footsteps coming down from the attic, followed by the light turning on in the front hallway. The footsteps would stop outside the boarded up door, which would crack open, followed by a blinding flash of white light in the room that would still be felt for the next several minutes after he closed his eyes. He compared the sensation to how it feels to be punched in the face, only without the physical pain of being hit. When he was finally able to regain composure, the door would be sealed shut again, and could not be opened, and it would be as if nothing had happened. I insisted this was not possible because the door was actually sealed shut and there was no doorknob, but he insisted that this happened on odd-numbered days (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) except for Sunday. 

Later that week, he asked me a question which freaked me out, ""Why do you go out for cigarettes at night only on the even-numbered days of the week -- Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday? And why always at 3 AM?"" I insisted that I absolutely did not get out of bed unless I needed to use the bathroom and that I did not even work on all of those days, so he definitely did not hear me coming home. He insists that he would hear the door open that connected my room to the front hallway (which I insisted I had always kept locked), followed by slow footsteps down the stairs, out the front door, and then back up about ten minutes later and back into my room. I insisted this could not be, because I would have heard my door opening, it creaked very loudly. On days I stayed up or was awake at 3, I did not hear this. We discussed it often and whichever time I was awake in the early AM, he would insist he heard it at a different time, when I know I was sleeping. I began to notice that the chair blocking that door would shift in position each morning, as if it had been moved. In response, I ended up blocking off the door with one of my dressers, which would have prevented it from being opened. As a response, my roommate claims the footsteps would now stop at the living room door, and enter the living room and head off toward the kitchen and dissipate. 

In the last few months of living upstairs, the activity intensified. Items would turn up in places that made no sense for them to be found. I would often be the last person to go into the kitchen at night, but the next morning, the refrigerator would be open and perishable items such as fruit, ice cream, or dairy would be left on the kitchen counter and would be either melted or no longer able to be eaten. The laundry machine would stop halfway through its cycles and would be unplugged. There were yellow streaks in the bathtub that would be there no matter how many times we washed them off. There was constant bickering between roommates about who was causing these things, and no one took responsibility. The worst occurrence of this type was when I woke up in the morning, the only person who stayed in the house that night, and walked past the stove and felt heat. The stove was left on, with an open flame! It is truly a miracle that the house did not catch fire. 

The final occurrence happened on my last day of the lease. The landlord expected us to remove all furniture we had personally brought into the house, and bring whatever remained that we were unable to take into the basement. I had never been in the basement and truly did not want to go. I refused to go alone. I went into the basement with two roommates. It was truly a creepy place. There were old doors piled up against a wall, which had obviously been in the house before but had been removed, explaining why there were a number of doorways that did not have a door. There was dust everywhere and old newspapers thrown about on the ground. All of a sudden, my car keys, which were deep in my pocket, fell onto the ground. I could feel them falling out and heard them hit the ground. I did not know how they had fallen from so deep inside my pocket, but when I bent over to pick them up, they were nowhere to be found. I heard where they had fallen and logic would dictate they should have been right there, but they were not. I retraced my steps and could not find them. Panicking, I called my mother, who was driving up to help me move my furniture out, and asked her to bring the spare set of keys from home.

I made it to the top of the stairs and my roommate stopped me. She says, ""I found these keys on the attic stairs, I almost tripped on them and fell down the stairs. Do you know who these belong to?"" Sure enough, there were my keys. To this day I still do not know how they got there. She reprimanded me for leaving them there, demanded to know why I was even trying to go upstairs to her room, and stormed off in a huff. 

As the last of my furniture was moved out, I stood at the bottom of the stairs and looked up, almost getting one last look at the area of the house which had caused me both fascination and grief. The door to my bedroom, which I had left shut all year and blocked off, was slightly cracked open and I could see a sliver of my room from downstairs. Despite all of the energy I was going to miss the upstairs of the house. I even came to believe all of the spirits living there were benign and simply going about their old lives as if they did not even realize they had passed. My mother was looking up the stairs and suddenly said ""There must be a draft. That door upstairs blew shut on its own."" 

I had turned away just before, and did not see it, but I believe her. And I know it was not a draft."
"The Man With A Gold Tooth","Massachusetts","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","Reference: Memories and a pad of paper by Msforgetmenott

This happened nearly two months ago.

He is here again, that man with a gold tooth, just as he appeared when I was a young child. I was nine when I last saw him, now I have had my 70th birthday this past May. While I have aged each year, Mr. Gold tooth has not aged a day. He had not seemed so small when I first saw him as a child, but now he makes me almost think of one of ""Tweed's"" little people.

Sitting smack-dab on my big old rocking chair, his legs out straight, holding on to the edges of the rocking chair's seat, as his limbs are to short to reach the chair's arms. It would be hard to tell how long he has been up here as I seldom come up to the attic. The chair has been up here for years, not fitting into my polished antique look.

The little man's hair is shinny white, but it is thin. He shows a bold smile that is noticed first, but the gold tooth is unforgettable. I couldn't remember what he wore as a child, but today he is wearing a grey woven suit, a fine gold watch chain slipped into his front side pocket. His eyes have bold laughing wrinkles, a vivid blue are their color.

Once held in my childhood home cellar, the chair we moved to our home, as it has family value and was a connection to the past. I looked towards the chair, for as a child when coming down the cellar stairs I had memories... The smiling man was a friend, I had thought, one only I could see. He had often greeted me back then and we would talk. My Mother had thought I had a big imagination as she did not see or hear him. I recall laughing with him and enjoying his kindness. The chair left me with fond memories of my Dad also, sitting near the chunk furnace, unlacing his old work boots while the furnace fired up. It was on the other side of this furnace that the farm dog would lay, lost in doggie dreams, but ever watchful, should my Dad shake the tin can, holding her supper.

I have made myself busy, what to keep what to throw, jobs I had put off until now. It was when I reached the last attic stair that I noticed him, my step instantly stopped. I know why he is here, this time it will be for me, not my Mother. I remember gazing upon him during those last days before my Mom had died. The chair had rocked ever so slowly now as it had then.

I made myself pass by him, centered on the second drawer of our old bureau dresser. My project today was to label all the old pictures, so that later, they could be copied and claimed by the nieces and nephews, also the Grandchildren. Each free day I pick a project to do, making it easier for my Husband and Son, when I am gone. Free days are the ones not filled with medical appointments, or other obligations.

The memory of this Oncologist slowing voicing her words has not faded from our minds, since the day my Husband of forty-eight years and I sat in her office stone frozen. It seemed like her words ""stage four, and urgent"" must have been for someone else, I had this cancer in 2003, and we were told at that time it was gone, cured. Yet in 2018 it is back and packing a very big punch. So I began the treatments, a total nightmare repeat... The moment I had seen little man sitting there I knew, as it was with my Mother, he had come to take me to the unknown level. When? I have no answer. 

I backed up from the bureau, asking quietly, how soon? He continued to sit unchanging also not answering. His eyes seemed to look at an object not even there. His hair moved to a wind that was not in the room. A wind I did not feel nor were the windows open to create such a draft. I asked again, when? He stared beyond, beyond my scope. Clenching my hands, I am not nine anymore! The earlier project forgotten I slipped away and down the attic steps... Unable to cope.

Sitting at my computer desk that evening, my phone in hand I needed my niece Val, close in age, and best friend. The daughter of an older sister, Val was born when I was only four. We were more as sisters, sharing much in an unusual way. We had even had paranormal events together in the past. Much like twins we would plan a meeting, and wear the same color and type of clothes. Oh how I needed her at that moment. She planned to come in a few days but... Now Val... Now At that moment the phone rang, I brightly answered, Hi Val! I was shocked when I heard Val's Husband's voice instead. ""Val left early, but was involved in an accident, she is in a hospital not far from you, can you get her please, I will start early in the morning and be there to pick her up as soon as possible. She has a broken wrist and minor bruises. She faired better than her car though.""

Heart, is stopped, my dear friend. ""She will fine but will be needing a new car""...heart is beating again. She will be ok... I can usually guess especially when it concerns Val, but my radar is way off. For much of my life I had thought the man in the rocking chair had come to take my Mother. The problem is, I think now I may have been wrong, I now think Mr. Gold Tooth may be trying to help in keeping my family alive. I am confused so confused, totally."
"Witch Of Yazoo","Mississippi","Ghost Hunting","The Witch of Yazoo's grave is located in Glenwood Cemetery in Yazoo Mississippi. The legend of the Witch of Yazoo became famous in Willie Morris' book, Good Old Boy published in 1971.

According to the legend, the witch lived on the Yazoo River and was caught killing fishermen who she lured in. The sheriff of the time is said to have chased her through the swamps where she was half drowned in quicksand by the time he caught up with her. As she was sinking, she swore her revenge on Yazoo City. ""In 20 years, I will return and burn this town to the ground!"" she said. On May 25, 1904, 20 years to the day she died, Yazoo City was destroyed by fire.

I, Gene Hamil, set out on an adventure to see if the Witch of Yazoo legend was true. Upon investigating the cemetery I can say something is definitely going on in Yazoo city. Another investigator that I was working with had a meeting with a historian for an episode of Mississippi Para Chasers that I was filming, two weeks later the historian died in a mysterious car accident. The question that came to mind was this caused by the witch? My team and I got with the Triangle Museum to learn more about the fire that broke out in 1904. Strange noises and EVPs were recorded there when asked questions specifically about the witch.

The first time I investigated the legend, it left me with more questions than answers. I went back months later to do another one. What I found was astonishing. So much so that it chilled me to the core!.

I have posted evidence of this on the Supernatural Research Society website."
"Pillow Talk","Ohio","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","Occasionally I am introduced to something that is different than the paranormal I am used to, such as the music I mentioned in my most recent story. (Thank you to those who helped me understand that one is probably not paranormal in nature.) This is another one of those different things and all insight is welcomed and appreciated.

The first experience I had with this was February 10, 2015. I had gone to bed and laid my head down (left ear on the pillow), when I felt and heard a vibrating sound and a noise under my ear as if someone was saying ""Ehhhhhhhhh"". My reaction was WTH is that?! There is nothing under the pillows, nor is there anything under my mattress. What caused that freaking vibration?! Of course, I lifted the pillows to see if anything was under there because I wasn't about to just put my hand under and feel (visions of rattlesnake here). There was nothing. I heard and felt the vibration/voice twice more that night: at 11:36pm and again a few minutes later. When I got up the next morning and made my bed, I checked just to make sure there was nothing under the pillows. Nothing there at all. I was fully awake all three times I heard/felt it and all three times the voice was female.

The next time I experienced it was June 29, 2015. This time I heard and felt the vibration sound and a male voice under my ear (I'm not sure which ear but am guessing left). I even lifted my pillows to make sure there was nothing under them that could make either sound. 

Things quieted down for about two years. Then on August 22, 2017, somewhere between 3:30am and 4:00am, I was laying on my right side, completely awake, when I heard ""ewwwwwweeeeeeewwwwww"" or ""eee oooo eeee ooo"" (sort of like in the Witch Doctor song) in a deep, low tone coming from under my pillow. I think this one was male. I also felt the vibration of that sound under my pillow. But this time I wasn't in my bedroom. I was sleeping in a spare bedroom. 

And then things quieted down again until just recently. On May 5, 2018, I had just gotten settled but not yet close to sleep, when I felt and heard a teenage male voice coming from under my pillow (right ear). He said something that sounded like hello but wasn't perfectly clear. A few minutes later I heard a female voice say two different things, still from underneath my pillow and still with vibration. What she said was only a one syllable word each time, so I couldn't make it out.

Around 10:30pm on June 4, 2018, I was laying on my left side, when I heard and felt a male voice say a 2-syllable word that began with the e sound. I heard and felt it come from under my pillow. 

The most recent was on the 10th of July. I shared this on a story of Tweed's because Manafon had an eerily similar experience that same night, at almost exactly the same time. I was laying on my left side when I heard from my underneath my pillow a young male voice yell help.

I sleep with two pillows and feel/hear the voice/vibration is between the pillows. I have changed the position of my bed numerous times since these experiences began. I have also changed my bedding, not that I think that would make a difference but who knows.

I honestly have no idea why I hear the voices, with vibration, coming from under my pillow because I hear voices from different areas in my home. 

The only thing I can see that is weird, but I am sure has no bearing, is three of the incidents are family members' birthdays. Thanks for reading and as I said, any and all input, thoughts, theories are welcome."
"Pressure On My Bed","Texas","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","This is the first time telling my story on any site. I've been googling what happened to me in order to hopefully find someone who has had a similar experience so I can figure out if I'm losing my mind or not! This has happened to me several times so please someone tell me what I'm dealing with if you can!

 I've heard stories where people wake up in the middle of the night by feeling a presence but that's not the case for me. When I go to bed it takes me a while to fall asleep. Now I'm on sleeping pills so the struggle is not so severe anymore. Well I get comfortable in bed and my mind races. Just thinking about my day and things like that. My eyes are wide open and I feel pressure at the end of my bed by my feet. I turn and look, thinking one of my kids are getting in bed with me. To my surprise, no one is there! A little confused, I turn over and just look at the wall. Then again I feel pressure at the end of my bed. This time I don't turn just to see what happens. The pressure begins to move up my bed. It really feels like someone is getting in bed with me. I can feel them crawling up the bed from behind me. A little freaked out I just freeze and stay still. Then I feel just a slight pressure on my leg as if someone is just putting their hand on me. Once being touched I jumped up real quick and absolutely nothing there. This same thing has happened to me several times and I don't know what to think about it.

 I've always loved ghost stories but that's all I thought they were, stories! I never thought that a supernatural being could enter act with the living world like that! I know for a fact what I experienced and I know for a fact it was not a dream or a figment of my imagination! I know it was something that I can't begin to explain! I just don't know what it is! I don't tell a lot of people cause I think they won't believe me! Please if anyone can tell me what is happening to me, I'd really appreciate it cause it's a little disturbing to say the least!"
"The Apartment Off Wilmington","Ohio","Haunted Places","(*For personal reasons and at request, I have changed names) 

 2011 was a tough year for me. My boyfriend of 5 years had suddenly dumped me at New Years, my grandmother grew very ill and died soon after, and I was back in a relationship after my break up with an ex. It wasn't easy but I found a job close to my boyfriend at the time and opted to move in with him. We had been broken up in high school but remained friends and decided to try to restart our relationship after he straightened up his life. So we moved into a nice 2 bedroom apartment off Wilmington Pike in Dayton. We didn't have much but we made due with the little bits of furniture his mother had given to him.

 *Joey was a wild card. Although he was very sweet and smart, he often didn't use common sense and never really thought EVERYTHING through. This is what landed him in trouble after high school with his rowdy drunken behavior. After breaking an ex's car window at a bar and yelling in public enough to disturb the whole damn city, he opted to get better and start to settle down. Settle down to him meant just drinking at home and putting his effort during his off time to a hobby we both enjoyed and bonded over. The paranormal. 

Joey was part of a local ghost hunting team. While I dabbled on and off between my 2 jobs, Joey put forth the most effort in the group. They drove to places around the city to investigate and even had a few people call to look into their own ""hauntings"". We had two rules when it came to investigating: don't bring anything home and don't bring a Ouija Board into the house. Obviously I wouldn't be writing this and sharing my story if he had actually listened to me.

 Around August Joey went on a ""hunt"" at a former camp near the city. I stayed home to catch up on the house work. So I packed him up, kissed his cheek, and told him I'd see him the next morning. About 3-4 hours after he left, he returned. I was really surprised seeing as I was expecting them to stay the night at the location. I noticed when he walked in, he was hiding a plastic bag behind the sofa and looked pretty run down. I asked him what was wrong and what was in the bag but he just said he needed a shower and walked away. I peeked in the bag and to my upset, a damn Ouija board. I didn't want to argue so I just went to the bedroom. Joey came out a few minute later and joined me in the bedroom. I asked him why the board was in the house and why, when I looked in, it was busted up.

 He then told me during a search of one of the old cabins, one of the guys brought out the board. All 4 of them in the group sat around it and started to ask some questions. Growing annoyed with getting nothing after 20 minutes, one of the guys busted it up and gave it to Joey to get rid of. Obviously Joey forgot to actually throw it away and thought it being inside the house until the morning was no big deal. I shrugged it off and asked him to please get rid of it by morning. It still didn't explain why he looked so distressed but I chalked it up to maybe knocking back a few beers and upset over not find anything at the campsite. By morning, Joey had gotten rid of the board.

 2 weeks later, Joey went off with his mother to visit his grandmother for the weekend. I had come down with a major stomach bug and chest cold so I again stayed home to rest up. I had the whole weekend planned. Sleep, sip some Sprite, sleep, eat a bowl of broth and repeat. Well, my weekend wasn't all that easy. Not long after Joey left, I heard knocking at our patio door. Thinking it was the neighbor kid asking to borrow our hose or to sell us his schools fundraiser candy, I got up and looked out the door. Nothing. I walked back and heard it again so I again checked. Nothing. I had the feeling the kids in the complex were playing a version of Ding Dong Ditch I stayed beside the door behind the blinds. I heard it again and flung open the door to scare them. But nobody was there. No sooner after I shut the door and locked it, I heard a massive bang in our bedroom. Grabbing a baseball bat, I walked back to the room to again find nothing. I checked the windows, under the bed and in the closet. Nothing at all. Not wanting to spook myself out or bug Joey, I just assumed it was our upkeep department and opted to go to bed cursing out loud how rude it is to do repairs so damn loud.

 About 2 hours after I went to bed, something woke me up. Joey and I shared a large waterbed. Although the movement was very soothing and never bugged me, this movement was damn near making me sicker than I was. It was like someone was wanting to wake me up and get my attention. Annoyed and confused I sat up and sighed. Looking at where the bed was being pushed I noticed a little girl at the end. I rubbed my eyes and when I reopened I saw the back of her running out. I got up and raced out to find nothing. I kept myself in the bedroom all weekend, with the door locked until Joey came home. It was after I told Joey about the girl that he opted to tell me why they left early.

 According to Joey, after they broke the board, he got a really bad feeling deep down. He said he tried to shrug it off but felt very uneasy once he and another member went a bit further into the woods to look at the other sites on the grounds. He said when they reached what appeared to be a school house, he suddenly felt very sick and passed out. While laying on the ground and his partner ran to get the first aid kit and the rest of the group fearing he had busted his head on a log or the cement blocks that are scattered around the area, Joey said he heard someone walk right beside him and kick his ribs. Joey said"" ""When I opened my eyes there was this really big black mass. It wasn't really human, it was just this very dark, heavy mass. It scared me but I couldn't yell out. I felt like I was being choked"". He then said he passed out again only to be woken up by one of the guys asking him a series of questions.

 I told him how the hell that would explain a little girl ""ghost"" (yes I used the quote marks while talking to him), he asked me if I remember what I learned about demons and other harmful ghosts. Knowing that a spirit can apparently manifest into something seeming very non threatening, I asked him if he really thought something came home with him. ""I guess..."" is all he told me. I explained I didn't really believe him about something coming home with him, but to be honest I was really worried about if something was attached to the board and then attached to him. 

 Fast forward a few months later. After a few bumps in the night, doors being open after closing them, and waking up to our stove on high for all 4 burners a handful of times; Joey and I were on the outs. He had been drinking more and had been hanging out with a young lady who he admitted he had slept with and was now proclaiming she was pregnant. Obviously this was heart breaking and caused a massive fight one night. I was standing in the kitchen yelling at him about the young woman and about how stupid he was (TBH, the girl is the trashiest thing this side of Ohio and has a terrible rep for getting knocked up over and over again without a clear remembrance of who she slept with around the time of her pregnancy. But I digress). Joey was a good 50 feet away from me in the hallway arguing with me. I took a step into the hall with one foot still in the kitchen. I was 15-20 feet away from our oven while we were yelling over each other. He stepped closer, got in my face as we just kept arguing. The oven door slammed open then shut as we stood there. It slammed down one more time as we both stood just looking at it. We didn't move for a good 2 minutes as we just shut up and tried to process what we saw. Joey then walked over, put up the oven door, and locked it. We didn't look at each other the whole night but soon apologized for the yelling and he apologized for his terrible choice. We opted to take a break but still live together until we figured what we'd do about this baby drama.

 3 days after, I was cleaning the bathroom. Joey was due to be home after his shift at work, so I opted to clean up and freshen our bathroom. Hearing the door open I thought ""why not scare the bastard"". I hid behind the door, which had a lovely crack to see out to the main room where I knew he would be walking past to go to the kitchen to grab his nightly 6 pack before walking down the hall where I would strike! I waited for him to walk past... But he never did. Thinking he was trying to scare me, I snuck out and jumped out to the main room, hoping to scare him for scaring me. Nothing. I was very scared at that point and grabbed my cell phone and something heavy. I looked around until I reached the kitchen. Knowing nobody past me I just stood there confused. That was until the locked oven door slammed down and a huge gust of foul wind flew past me. I ran out of the apartment and down the end of the road where I called Joey to get home quick. After he arrived and consoled my scared ass, I told him I was leaving right then and there. I have never packed so damn quick in my life. I never went back to the apartment after that night.

 Its been a few years now. Joey is the proud father of my Godson, *Greg and I am due to be married this year to a man I met at work while I lived with Joey. Joey ended up moving out of the apartment a few weeks after me. We have never gone back and actually ended up leaving stuff there. The only scary things that have happened after the move was us having very vivid nightmares and my godson asking me why I didn't want to play with the pretty girl at the apartment... We've never told Greg about the apartment so we have no idea how he knows about the girl..."
"Beware Of Dog","Oregon","Pets / Animals","This occurred sometime in late summer or early fall in 1998. I was a senior in high school, and my two best friends were sisters; one was a year older than me, Jane; the other, Kat, a year younger. Jane had gone off to college, leaving us two younger girls to make our own fun. We lived in a very rural community with not much going on. The three of us were ""different"" from the FFA kids or athletes at school; we preferred art, music, vintage clothes, and anything weird we could get our hands on. This included the Ouija board. 

The summer before Jane had left for college, the three of us did a lot - a LOT - of experimenting with the Ouija board. We thought we knew what we were doing - being respectful, always say goodbye, etc - however, this could not be further from the truth. This story doesn't directly involve the board, but I've always wondered if it has something to do with what Kat & I experienced one night. 

When you're young, have a driver's license and live in a small town, you often take drives for fun (at least in the 90's we did). Kat & I would take my car, a '96 Nissan, to local cemeteries & talk for hours on occasion. We'd just sit in the car, listen to music & chat like proper weirdos, hanging out at the cemetery. One evening, after dark, we decided to make the 10-mile drive to a neighboring town's cemetery. This town is very much like our own hometown, but maybe an eighth of the size, about 200 people. The cemetery sits up on a hill about a mile out of town - the first turn off the highway, through a residential area, and around a bend which takes you up the hill. As soon as we hit the city limits around the corner, I slammed on my brakes to avoid hitting a dog sitting right in the middle of my lane. It was an older dog, probably a blue heeler, with cloudy eyes & grey around the muzzle. He got up & stiffly wandered to the side of the road to get out of our way. Kat & I continued up the road to our destination, another few minutes by car. We'd never been to this cemetery before, so we weren't sure what to expect. I pulled into the gravel parking lot & we were unimpressed - no lights anywhere, we were too uncomfortable to get out of the car. We exchanged a quick dialog like, ""This sucks, let's go home"", and before I could put my car into reverse we heard the most blood-curdling, vicious, LOUD barking & growling IN the car. Two brief, but very distinct, barks & snarling... Coming from what sounded like the back seat. 

The windows were up, the music was off, and in our horror & shock - that WTH moment - quickly turned around to see if somehow the dog from down the road had magically jumped into the car. There was nothing there. I peeled out of the parking lot & headed down the hill, expecting to see a dog just outside of the cemetery grounds. Nope. 

As we made our way down the hill, sure enough, the same dog we encountered on the way up was in the middle of the road. Again, I slammed on the brakes to avoid hitting him, and he wandered to the side of the road. Looking in the rearview, he went back to the same spot, almost like he was guarding something... Perhaps the cemetery? I'm not sure. We rounded the bend back into town & back to the highway towards home. Kat & I had no explanation for the sound - just that it sounded exactly like a very angry dog in the back seat for 3 seconds, maybe only 2. Was it a warning to just get out of there? Was the dog in the road an apparition of the snarls & barks we heard? Did we unleash something with the board, and it was angry we were just hanging around in cemeteries? 

Whatever it was, it scared the bejeezus out of us... We never returned to that cemetery."
"Boy Made Of Light","New York","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","The incident I'm about to share happened to my son about 5 years ago when he was 9 - 10 years old. It is not scary, but in my opinion, amazing nonetheless and dear to my heart.

A little bit of background first... My son (I'll call him Peter to protect his privacy) had a few experiences in regards to seeing 'figures' in his room when he was about 9 years old. From the way he described them, it sounded like he was seeing shadow figures. These figures didn't interact with him, he would just notice them in the corner of his room or standing across the room from his bed. The figures were seen maybe 4 - 5 times over the course of a year. Sometimes Peter came to me in the night and sometimes he told me in the morning. 

I have always been open with my children when it comes to spirit, deceased loved ones, paranormal happenings, etc. However, I do check for non paranormal causes first if I can. No need to scare ourselves silly if the shadow figure was caused by a coat hanging on a peg or a toy that appears to be a man in the dark. So of course, I investigated Peter's room during the day and at night to see if there was anything that would mimic a figure. After listening to him describe a figure; it's height, whereabouts in his room, his perspective, any movement, etc. I came up empty handed. My son never felt frightened, more uneasy when they appeared. I didn't 'feel' anything in his room either (no creepy vibes, heaviness, etc). 

So I talked to him about praying and imagining a white light of protection around him and his room. I also believe in spirit guides, and encouraged him to communicate with them, asking for their assistance. I also did the same on my end and just in case I was missing something, went in his room and spoke out loud to whatever was there (if there was) in a polite but firm way to not frighten my son. I also spoke of moving on to the light... You get the gist. 

My son told me how much better he felt right away and he did not report seeing any figures for quite some time. Then, one morning about a year later, he told me about a figure that has intrigued me ever since. The night it occurred, Peter said he hadn't fallen asleep yet and was laying there thinking about a game he wanted. He was facing the wall, then turned over to face his room and saw a figure standing across his room. He described the figure as a boy, probably his height and that he was ""all white light"". He could see the outline of the boy's head, arms, legs and torso, but no details as far as features or clothing. Peter said the boy also had a bow and arrow on his back. I asked for details and how he knew this. He said it looked like the boy had a bow on his back, but that it was sideways (or horizontal) so that the bow sort of looked like a half circle behind his back (he could only see the ends of the bow because the boy's body partially obstructed it). 

This 'boy' also kept appearing close to my son and then a second later, across the room when he closed his eyes. It sounded as if the boy was almost playing with my son or being silly. The boy did this 'near - far' game a few times before disappearing altogether. At the time, Peter said he felt a bit confused, but not frightened. Honestly, I was flabbergasted at first. I couldn't think of a way to try to debunk this or what on earth it could be. I thought about what he described to me for awhile and finally told my son that he must have been visited by his guardian angel or perhaps a spirit guide. The boy never appeared again, but my son has never forgotten the details, nor have I. Peter remains adamant on the details and insists he wasn't sleeping. 

After the appearance of the 'boy made of light', my son never experienced a shadow figure or light figure again. I do believe my son had a special visit, and told him how lucky he is to have seen his guardian angel or guide. I still think about this and wonder if anyone else has had something similar happen?"
"Phone Message","California","Family / Friends Visits","My father passed away in May 2006 due to complication with Diabetes. He had been fighting an infection in one of his feet for several months, he went to see a lot of doctors in the hopes that they would be able to save his leg. Unfortunately, they were not able to save his leg and it ended up being amputated. After the surgery to remove his leg my dad was never the same. He was constantly depressed, in a bad mood, a complete different person. He passed away 7 months later. 

I (and other members of my family) experienced several unexplained incidents around the time of his passing (before, DURING and after). This is just one of those incidents that I myself experienced when I was alone. 

Maybe, 5 or 6 months after he passed away I was going through some cupboards in the kitchen looking for I don't remember what when I found a little blue cell phone that use to belong to my mom. She had purchased a new one about a year before and gave that to my 5 year old daughter to play around with.

 I thought it was a pretty cute phone to be stored away without being used so I started pushing buttons and was able to get it to turn on. I'm not sure what button I pressed that I suddenly heard my mom's voice coming from the speaker that said ""hold on, let me have you speak to him"".

 Next I heard my dad's voice talking in that happy, carefree voice he use to have saying ""I'm feeling so much better now, there's no more pain, I can walk again, don't worry about me, I'm fine"". My heart skipped a beat and I had tears running down my face, I hugged the phone to my chest as if I was holding him and just went down on my knees crying.

 After a few minutes I got up and went to my bedroom taking the phone with me, I needed to hear his voice again so I sat on the bed and started pushing buttons to get the recording back but the phone was dead. I ran around looking for a charger that would fit that phone, I was dumping the contents of drawers looking for that cable like a crazy woman. Later I was able to get the phone charged and no matter what I did I was never able to get that recording back. I asked my mom if she remembers ever having or hearing that conversation since I heard her on the phone too, she says she doesn't remember and doesn't know what I'm talking about. 

Now I'm not saying that my dad recorded that message from the grave, I think he could have been talking to a family member when he was alive and somehow that part got recorded, all I can say for sure is that the message was received exactly when it was needed the most."
"Big Brother Is Watching","Illinois","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","It was January 2, 2018 and it was really cold out, like 6 degrees, but I really had to go to the store. My roommate was sick so, I bundled up good, and began the 3 block trek to the nearest Mom and Pop, hoping they'd have what we desperately needed. 

About a block into my walk, a car started creeping alongside me. I glanced over, but didn't recognize it or the driver, who was clearly staring at me. I told myself I was being paranoid as every red flag in my brain began waving. I'm aware because of my stature, and being so bundled up, he might have mistaken me for a young girl. Most 12 year olds are taller than me. On the other hand, he might be just looking for an address, or debating if I was someone he knew, or just thinking of being nice and offering a lift. 

He pulled to a stop at the intersection and poked his head out. If my flags were waving, they were now screaming 'danger' at me. Something was way, way off, especially when he opened the door and stepped out. 

Now it gets really weird. I stopped dead in my tracks, debating which way to run, if the need arises, as I'm between houses. No way was I getting within an arm's length of this guy; I could smell the booze from where I was. He was saying something about it being too cold to walk, and he'd be glad to give me a ride. I shook my head saying, ""No thanks.""

 He got insistent taking a step towards me; I feel my weight shift as my hands curl into loose fists. ""I SAID, no thanks,"" as I took a step back while, my mind feverishly plotted a flight path, and my muscles readied to fight. He staggers closer, ""C'mon. I just being nice. Get in the car."" 

I side stepped, and growled, ""Leave me alone,"" my eyes looking for traffic or signs of life nearby, while staring him down. Silently I prayed, ""God, if I can't outrun him, please let me be able to kick his ass."" Suddenly out of nowhere I hear someone call my name. Both our heads jerked in that direction.

A young man was approaching; wearing a black leather jacket, and the kind of jeans we use to call chinos. His hair was slicked back... Looking at someone who looks like they stepped out of a tough guy 50s film is one thing; but looking at one who knows your name, and looks like your brother once did is another - especially when the brother would be near 70 years old, a double amputee, living states away, and died 3 years ago. 

In that moment I didn't care how illogical it was. ""Richard!"" There was that same smile that somehow didn't show his teeth but flashed a dimple. He's still maybe 2 feet away, but he says, ""Problem, Val?"" I ran to him even as my mind said this couldn't be. That other guy is wasting no time leaving. I force myself to look at his license plate, and in that instant my brother disappeared.

I finished going to the store, and from there I called the cops and reported that driver. Maybe he was just a drunk trying to be nice, but if it summoned help like that, I think the intent was much worse."
"Phantom Car?","North Carolina","Non Human Entities","Greetings one and all!

This is my first posting, and I may make a few others depending upon how this is received. If I may be permitted a few words about myself. I am at heart a skeptic as regards matters of the supernatural. I believe that most people who tell these tales and relate these experiences are telling the truth, from their perspective; but if they were to investigate the event sufficiently they would find that there was a natural explanation for what they have experienced. Having ""busted"" several ""ghosts"" I am not speaking out of my hat. I follow these stories hoping to find that I am wrong - I wish I believed that there was life after death I just have never seen any evidence of it.

To my story:

Perhaps seven years ago (2011 or so) in the summer (lord don't ask for the month) I was driving home from work it was about 4:30 PM on a bright sunny after noon. I work in a small city in the coastal plain of Northern North Carolina. I live in a small county with no cities or towns, pretty rural and pretty flat. I was about midway between home and work, pretty much smack in the middle nowhere. As I was approaching one of the few intersections, a farm path running onto the main thoroughfare, I noticed an antique car coming off the farm path, it was a brown car from the early 1930's (I'm hardly an expert on such matters but am a huge fan of older movies so a could pretty well fix time frame of the car if not the make and model). After I passed the car (and no I didn't look inside the car to see the driver, I was admiring the restoration job the owner had clearly done) the car pulled out an followed me. I was surprised that anyone would take such a car on the farm paths, but what the heck right? After about a quarter of mile, perhaps a half mile, I looked in the mirror and was surprised to see that the car was no longer there. In most cases and in most places this would come as no surprise, but here, the middle of nowhere, there was no place the car could have gone. I came to place where I could turn around (I drive an F250 so not really maneuverable) and back tracked to see if the car had fallen into the deep ditch, really the only place it could go. I found nothing.

In the ensuing years I've seen the car on the same road several times and and every time I've seen it it disappears. This is not to say I've actually seen the car vanish, but I'll be watching the car, my attention is called elsewhere and when I look back the car is gone and there is no place it could have gone to. I've told several people and nothing. I've looked for the car parked in a yard or open barn and again nothing. My wife, who does believe in ghosts, thinks I'm seeing a ghost car. I have no explanation but would be interested in the thoughts of this crowd.

Thank you for the time you took to read this, sorry it wasn't spooky or eerie."
"A Case For Elementals...?","Florida","Misc","This is my first submission. I have several that I will share over time. This particular story is of 2 separate incidents from 2 separate locations and 2 separate time periods in my life but concerning related creatures of origins uncertain. I believe myself to be a form of ""Sensitive"" that has disregarded their ability due to personal reasons. However, things have always ""Found"" me... After a fashion. 

 The first incident was during a ""Haunting"" experience that was tormenting me as a child around 7 or 8 years old. When I was approximately 5 years old my family had moved to a very small and rural area in Florida called ""Wimauma"" to what was then known as a ""Fish farm,"" owned by my grandparents, where my parents and I moved after a death in the family, to raise and sell tropical fish to pet stores. This place in particular had several Haunting incidents that I will share in other entries. 

This one night in particular, when I was around 7 years old, I was awoken repeatedly by a Shadow figure with glowing eyes, it eventually left me alone and later that same night I awoke to a strange feeling that something ""else"" was in the room with me. I looked around and saw nothing but felt as if there was something under my bed. Now, we lived in a single wide trailer there and my room was quite small, my twin was in the corner up against the wall next to the doorway and there was no one else in the room save my small Manchester Terrier.

 After having seen the Shadow figure and feeling quite apprehensive I somehow found the courage to force my bed away from the wall to see what was there. It was a body, but not a normal body. It was approximately man-sized and somewhat grotesque. Covered head to toe in what appeared to be Spanish moss and skin resembling Pine Bark. As nothing more than a point of reference... Imagine ""Groot"" from ""Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy,"" only more human-like and decisively more grotesque and lying on its side in an almost fetal position. I went into shock upon seeing it. It stirred and turned slightly to stare into my eyes and tell me -- ""leave me alone I don't want to be bothered by you"" and turned back over. I shoved the bed back as best I could, and attempted to return to sleep.

 For several weeks following I dreamt of a small squat creature... Grey & furry with bulging eyes and a green mane, pointed teeth and claw-like hands that called itself ""Kromon, the creature king."" 

 The second incident happened at 49 years of age in a town known as ""Port Charlotte."" One night I had a distinct and lucid nightmare, which I couldn't initially recall upon awakening. I now sleep with the aid of a CPAP and cannot be heard if and/or when I speak in my sleep. My wife questioned me that morning if I had a nightmare because I had been moving uncontrollably and attempting to speak through my mask, albeit distorted, and was covered head to toe with goosebumps.

 Initially I couldn't recall, but as I fell asleep it came back to me and I began speaking out loud about what I saw. I was walking through a warehouse style building with a large fish tank in my presence. There was a single hose in the tank and something was leaking out of the hose into the tank. It was an arm with very pointed nails and shock white slimy skin. It progressively became a writhing female figure with compressed facial features, a demure look and long brownish green hair. It began speaking to me and told me that my death would be caused by something or someone called ""Parsons"" or ""Parnus"" and then slithered back into the hose. 

 After some research I have found that the closest description that I have been able to come to these 2 creatures are that of an Earth Elemental and a Water Elemental. What I discovered is that few people have ever actually seen these creatures. However, I have apparently been visited by 2. Are they really Elementals? If so why show themselves to me? What is so special about me that I should have seen 2 of these creatures when they are so rarely seen by anyone? I may never know... I share these events in order to validate anyone who may have had similar experiences and be uncertain of their reality."
"The Noontime Knocking Update","Connecticut","Haunted Places","So I posted not long ago about how every day between 12 and 12:30, someone knocks on the walls in my house.

Recently, the knocking stopped. For at least a week. I have gone about saying Hello to Papi, our man cave ghost, and given a set of rosaries to my mom. I thought one of those two would quell the knocking. Instead, things have escalated slightly.

I have a set of rosaries in my bedroom that hangs next to my door. My door is usually open during the day, so the animals can come and go as they please from my room. Recently, I have noticed a dark figure standing in the hallway. It doesn't do anything, just stands there.

On occasion, I now catch a male whispering in my ear when I am in other rooms.

Now as to why this is a Part 2 or Update. Today I was hanging out in the living room listening to Mamma Mia 2 soundtrack and singing along when, the KNOCKING occurred again but at 12:31, and this time, in the kitchen. I believe it was on the basement door. I am also about a million percent positive its not me hallucinating, because when it happened, the dogs went NUTS. The past few times they did bark as well, and my mother has heard the knocking...

But the knocking doesn't occur when I am not home. So now it's starting to feel like it is VERY MUCH directed towards me. My sister was at the house multiple times recently, alone at the time and the knocking never occurred.

I just don't know what to do or how to handle this situation. It is starting to make me anxious about getting up at night just to go to the bathroom."
"Ghost House From My Childhood","Ohio","Haunted Places","I use to live in this house when I was a kid, until I was 14. Strange things would happen in the house and I rarely wanted to go upstairs by myself. One time my niece, who was 4 at the time, described a figure she was seeing that was in mother's closet. ""He's funny looking,"" and described him like a clown. She never said a clown but the way she described it made me know that's what she meant. Another time I was sitting in the front room and someone yanked the back of my ponytail and when I turned around no one was there.

 The one thing that scared me the most was when I was sleeping and felt like someone was poking me. I woke up and this dark figure was standing over me and they had no facial features or anything descriptive about them. It was just a black shadow. As soon as the light was on it was gone. I remember telling my sister about this and she explained that my other sister was a Wicca, and she cast out her demon in that room.

 Another time that freaked me out was I was in the restroom and I hear my sister scream from the room, next thing I know she yells out. ""F*** you ghost"" and puts salt around the border of the room. She swears she saw a ghost standing by the foot of the bed.

 My mother also had many experiences one relating to a little girl playing in her room, she could hear her giggle and running around. This was the same room my niece said she saw the clown like ghost. Another time she pulled into the driveway and saw an old man in old time clothes and held a rake. 

Our house used to be a cornfield and I don't know if it's true or not but our neighbors said 15 years ago a little girl used to stand near the corn to wait for the bus and one day the road was so icy that the little girl got ran over by the bus. I no longer live in the house, but I have plenty of more stories that happened to me, or my siblings."
"Battle At Little Bighorn","Montana","Haunted Places","In Montana driving from Pine Ridge Rez in South Dakota to catch a flight in Billings the next afternoon. Late that day I came upon the national historic site of Little Bighorn Battlefield, aka. Custer's Last Stand, aka. The Greasy Grass Creek. 

I had no plans to stop here, I saw it on the map though. I figured what the heck, it's not closed and I have plenty of time so I turned off. I went to the graveyard beside the visitor center first and thought, 'this is it?"" I then went to the visitor center to learn that I could drive across the beautiful rolling hills to view where these unfortunate, deadly battles happened. I had time to go to a couple pull-overs before the park closed so I took off in my rental. 

I parked and walked over to the overview while diverting my eyes towards the ground. When I looked out onto the hills at the over-look, I saw calvary men and native people fighting. I immediately shook my head back and forth in disbelief, similar to a dog shaking when wet. Once I shook my head, I did not see anything so I carried on with my investigation of marked graves and the natural environment. I forgot about the battle experience before walking back to my rental. Things similar to this have happened to me before and I just count it as another experience. 

I drove to the next over-look and once again was looking at the ground as I walked, totally oblivious to much if any thoughts. I looked out upon the hills and saw another battle, a different battle. I could see some men on horses and some on foot fighting with guns and hand held weapons. It slowly dissipated. By now, it is time to leave because they are closing. I found a campsite not too far away, I was going to drive closer to Billings and hang out there until my flight but after this experience there was no way I was going to leave without finding out if this would happen again. 

The next morning, I was waiting at the gate before they opened it for the day. I immediately drove to the further over-looks and at each and every one I saw a battle occurring, all different from the previous. So now I am wondering why I would see these things, more on that latter. 

I still had a little time to spare so I decided to walk on the little nature trail behind the visitor center to look for wildlfowers and rattlesnakes to photograph. I happen to like to identify wildlife of all kinds but am especially fond of snakes. 

I photographed a few wildflowers as I walked along the path and then, I was stopped dead, as if I hit a brick wall. I could not walk further and I felt as if there were dead bodies everywhere. I looked around, still not able to move forward and did not see any marked graves. I said to myself, ""you are silly, there are dead bodies here because there are not marked graves."" At that point I could continue along the trail and did. When I reached the end of the trail, the kiosk basically said, this is where the deadliest of battles were fought and there are dead bodies everywhere. I thought, ""well there you go."" At this point I regrettably had to continue my travels to catch my flight. 

I was at a Native Sundance in southeast South Dakota a few years after I visited the battlefield and had a chance to speak with an elder. I asked why it is that I have so many experiences at native sites and or reservations. I told him of this experience and another at Canyon de Chelley in Arizona. He said I was meant to be a bridge of sorts between native people and non-natives."
"Ghost App","California","Family / Friends Visits","I know what you're thinking! ""Ghost app? Bunch of baloney!"" I thought the same when I first heard of it and even more when I first used it (I started using this app about 2 years ago so around the end of 2015 or begging 2016) but the more I used it the more the responses became more relevant to my questions or activity I was doing at the time. Out of curiosity I started letting the app run while I was doing anything, I wouldn't interact or do things to provoke them to speak. It would be unbelievably accurate and I accepted the fact that it worked as long as there was something around you or nearby. I still use the app to this day just not as much as I use to.

 Well, in 2016 my sister who was older than me by 6 months passed away suddenly, I know this is extremely personal however it is indeed very important. It was a dark year for our family so my mom decided we were to pack up and move back to California for the support of (sorry but as I was typing that I felt someone touch my shoulder hard enough it moved a little, I'm alone in my room right now so I had to share) our family. I was enrolled in to the school my sister use to go to where I met a lot of like minded people, one of those people was a junior who told me she was a pagan witch (forgive me if I spelt that wrong). We quickly bonded over our paranormal experiences and messed up backgrounds, we'll call her Jade for this story and any other story she may come up in. 

 Jade and I were extremely interested in the paranormal, that's what we liked to talk about most. So one day while Jade and I are in biology class (she failed it and I never took it in Chicago so we had to be there) finishing up the details on one of our projects, when I had the great idea to open up my ghost app. Now I had two phones at the time; one for strictly music and wasn't activated and another that was activated and meant for social media and the famous ghost app. 

So I pull one of my ear buds out, leaving the other one in to continue listening to my music, and placed my activated phone in between us and explained what the app was to Jade. As I'm explaining the playlist plays the next song which is Fairly Local by 21 pilots and it holds a good memory my sister and I shared, I mention it because of what's coming up. So of course she's estastic and immediately started firing questions at it as she's trying to finish her side of the project, one the first questions she asked (of course) ""who are you"". She has her head down trying her hardest to finish while I'm looking at the app when it says ""Fairly Local"". 

 I felt my heart drop and suddenly I could hear the song a lot more clearer than I could have a second ago and had a quick flash back to when my sister and I had our first real sister moment, then I felt a presence next to me that I failed to mention to Jade but I knew she's could feel it because she snapped her head up at the app the moment I felt the presence. We looked at each other and had a silent exchange about whether we both felt the same presence. I didn't want to acknowledge it but it was my sister letting me know it was her. 

I have yet to tell my mom and sisters, partly because I don't want to out myself about using the app and partly because I don't want to be brushed off like I normally am when I bring up the paranormal to my family. And yes I know it's stupid to use the app but I'm attracted to the paranormal like a itch I can't get, don't ask me why because I honestly do not know. 

Thanks for reading! This is one of the not to creepy experiences I have had. I know I'm posting left and right but I absolutely love sharing my experiences with other people!"
"The Skin Walker","Alaska","A Haunted Life","The first experience. Aged 8. 

 At first it would only run up and down the hallway. It would peek just around my door way some nights and leave me frozen in fear. I was too stiff to call out for my mother. Eventually it became brazen off my fear and would kneel down in my doorway. There it would sit before its bones cracked out of place. The figure was nearly eight feet tall. Black skin shrouded over bones with nothing to cushion against the creaking ligaments. Wide far spread eyes glowed and ominous white. I still remember how it crawled to the side of my bed like some contorted crab. When I shut my eyes tightly it would be gone before I opened them once more and it was back at the doorway. They couldn't touch me when my eyes closed. 

 This could be passed off for a young child's playful mind if it was not for my parents attention brought to it... My mother and father told me when I was older that I only stopped complaining when a man began to stand in my hallway. My mother had saw him first. A soft figure in a red old cape and furred clothing with worn leathers. He was obvious native america and from the Alaskan tribes or North Canadian. When he begun to appear the haunting ended in that house. When we moved they surged at me violently and I experienced Skin Walkers and other beings regularly until I was thirteen. At fourteen an old woman, when I lived in Germany, told my aura was dark and that several demons had tried to follow me into her house. She had rosaries all over her home. Since then I've witnessed horrifying sounds, touches, scratching on my bedposts, and other teasing horrors. Nothing really makes them go away unless I go on certain medicines or try my best to ignore everything. I've got autoimmune disorders, severe anxiety, and depression. Could these play into the attraction some dark entities have towards me? I am no longer interested in making it end. I know it won't. I just want to know how to protect myself and how to learn more about exactly each thing."
"Ye Old Schoolhouse","Connecticut","Haunted Places","I feel like I've just been flooding this site with my stories lately, and I do apologize, but this is the first time I've been comfortable opening up completely about my paranormal experiences. It might be wise to reference my other stories/accounts to understand the place where I live, because this is yet another ghost story in my home town. If anyone is on the astral voyage site, I have also posted about dreams of the place I am going to bring up now.

In my little village part of town, we have an old schoolhouse. The building is two story, with a colonial pitch roof and a bell tower. My great grandmother actually went to school in the school house before it was closed. A few years later, the village was given the rights to incorporate a volunteer fire company. The fire company originally had a firehouse in the valley in town, but it was basically just a garage. So the town allowed the department the rights to the old school house. They added a large truck bay on the right side, the bay had only two garage doors, and was two trucks deep on either side. They renovated to make the building a useful firehouse. The firehouse was in use until 2009 or so. (I can't give you the exact date the building had been converted, or even a year.) So the firehouse had a very simple lay out.

Now it should be noted, that on the back wall of the truck bay, we hung up the winter chains for the firetrucks. They don't have four wheel drive, so we have to put these monster chains with spikes on them on the wheels to grip the road during harsh snow storms and winter.

On the right was the truck room, there were five doors off the truck room, to the left, into the main section of the building. The one all the way to the back was to the mechanic's room, where our ""designated engineer"" would have all his equipment to work on minor things on the trucks. The door next to that was to an old wash room, which had a toilet no one ever used and a giant sink. The next door went into a tiny room with a built in desk. You could fit maybe three people wide in the room, it was our Radio room, where we could talk to dispatch from the firehouse. The next door was two doors that slid together and locked, These doors went into the main hall of the fire house, which we literally just called the main hall. There was one more door on the other side of that, at the very front of the truck bays that also went into the hall. (No idea WHY that was a thing.) 

Inside the hall, against the right wall there was a small stage. On the left wall, there was two built in shelves with hidden compartments and a small closet like area that was only ever covered with a curtain, where we put all the chairs and tables the firehouse owned. On the back side of the hall was a large window opening into the kitchen. Which was really just like a normal house hold kitchen. Next to that window was the door that led to the hallway which led out to a set of concrete stairs down to the back parking lot. Off that hallway was a small second hallway that led to the boys and girls bathrooms. And directly across from the bathroom hallway opening was a large room that we called the meeting room.

The basement of the firehouse was still set up like an early 20th century cafeteria. I hated being down there. (Also, there were stairs that spontaneously went up into the middle of the firehouse stage in the hall. Like... What?) 

So I have a LOT of stories involving the old firehouse. I used to live on this road about a half mile from the firehouse. I was a junior fire fighter at the time and the pagers went off. I got on my bike, my little brother got on his bike, (I was begrudgingly watching him) and we rode to the firehouse. I missed the firetrucks, so my little brother and I went inside to sit in the radio room and listen to the radio. 

I was in the radio room, at this point, my little brother had wandered out front and was playing an imaginary game of Pokemon. A senior fire man showed up and was out front watching my little brother while I listened to the radio. As I was sitting there, I suddenly heard the chains rattling. I got up and bolted out of the firehouse, immediately accusing my brother of rattling the chains, but the senior fireman told me that he had been out front the entire time. I went back to inspect the chains, also rather... Begrudgingly, and found that they were hanging far enough up the wall that no mice could have moved them. (They were at least a foot and a half off the ground hanging on a coat rack on the wall.) I pretty much freaked out at that point and grabbed my bike, my little brother and we left. After that, I refused to stay alone in the firehouse, even for a minute.

There were other things that happened there. I used to hear someone walking around in the main hall when I was in the meeting room, (once, my oldest sister was actually sitting in the meeting room with me, and heard it.) We occasionally heard someone tapping a pencil on a table or desk, but again, we'd be the only ones there. My father used to fill out reports on the computer in the meeting room when he had time, so most of the time he was alone, and he'd actually hear people talking.

For whatever reason, I absolutely HATED the bathrooms. I wouldn't go down that hall if someone paid me to. And I never went into the women's room alone, I always waited until someone else said they needed to go, then I tagged along.

The building has since been closed as a firehouse and renovated into two affordable housing apartments. I know one of the residents of the apartments, but we don't really talk much and we're not close, so I don't feel comfortable asking him about paranormal things. 

I mean, these experiences could've just been residual, they could've been intelligent, and as I was a teenager, it could've been a positive spirit or a negative one, but... I couldn't say. 

Again, sorry I keep spamming the site with my stories. But I feel at ease sharing my tales here."
"Demonic? Principalities? And A Lost Cc","Nebraska","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","Sorry for the long absence. Life has been hectic but I took a moment to share something that happened this last Friday - the 13th of July.

If you've followed my comments and stories, you know I have a rather Pain in the Asterisks entity bugging me. Picked him up at a hotel - yes distinctly male - a hunter in Camo if you can believe it. I've even seen him a couple times. I genuinely believe he is the one disappearing my small kitchen gadgets, shoes and bric a brac. He also has a nasty habit of clomping around in his hunting boots in the wee hours of the morning.

I've tried smudging, cleansing, prayers, salt, black and red salt, and many other rituals. Nothing phases this man-critter. On to this particular event.

Something I need to make clear. I do not carry a purse when going out on a job. I tuck my wallet and phone into a designated pocket on my tool kit.

I had a rather long drive - 5 hours one way, and 5 back - so I went and filled up my smurf and hit the road. I distinctly remember giving my (very pretty white and silver sparkly) CC to the full service attendant. He gave it back, I tucked it into it's specific pocket and set my wallet back inside the car while I chatted with the attendant. I go to this gas station regularly and always have the same attendant - 2 years plus. We're friends of a sort.

Anyway, about an hour out I have an overwhelming craving for some European lemon shortbread. The ONLY store with what I was craving for hundreds of miles is coming up in about 5 miles. Of course I decide to stop. I go in, get what I want, and go to pay, only to find my white sparkly CC is missing. It makes me blink a bit, but I pull out my black sparkly CC and pay for my cookies and drinks. I go back to my car and search ALL OVER. Then I turn out my wallet, every single pocket and flap. Nothing. I call the gas station, worried it fell out or maybe the attendant didn't give it back.

They know who I am - pays to be regular in a small town. They look at the video, the video clearly shows me giving the card, and getting it back. Then she says ""your wallet is black right? With a silver design? You put it in a pocket inside the wallet, on the silver design side.""

Which is exactly correct. That is what I remembered, and moreover, it is exactly where the CC goes. I have my wallet laid out precisely, each card in it's place. Oh boy, now I sound OCD. It's just easier to keep track if everything has a place.

The absolute frustration is distracting. I know where I put it, I even have a video record of it. Where the hell is it? I tear the car apart again, then my wallet again. After over an hour and a half of looking, I call and have the card cancelled. I continued on my way to my job stewing and fretting with every mile. 

Twice during the drive, out of the corner of my eye, I see the shadow of a man in a hat seated in the passenger seat, and I swear I hear boots clomping in my car. I basically ignored it and drove on.

I got home after midnight, and my husband waited up for me. He tore through my wallet, just as I had. The next morning he went out to the car to check. NADA. ZIP. ZERO.

I have to get some stuff for Sunday dinner (I make homemade Sunday Dinner for my MIL at the nursing home) and run to the store. I open my wallet to pay, and my pretty white sparkly CC is laying on top of my ID, just under the flap.

First thought was hubby found it - I called him and asked where he found it. He staunchly denied it. Says he would have shredded it because I'd already cancelled it. Which is true, he would have, after showing it to me.

After the conversation with my hubby, I said - out loud in my car. ""You've gone too far. Y'know my rules, you can hang out as long as you don't inconvenience your hostess - ya just pushed my line. I will get rid of you, I won't have something that is being deliberately malicious messin' with my job or finances.""

I swear, I heard a snort, like 'good luck.'

Here is the odd part my friends. My brother, who almost never calls, who is very much into something he called 'Principalities', called me perhaps ten minutes later. He said that he got a message to call me, and he asked if anything odd had happened. I told him about the CC issue and some of the other things. He is very worried, he said he'd been lead to calling me, and now he knows why. He says the man-critter is a demonic presence, and was very likely behind not only the small things, but the car accident I had a few weeks ago that totaled my car. He asked if I'd had any unusual, strange, distinctly out of character thoughts. The answer to that is yes. I had a thought so horrible the other day it physically made me ill.

He gave me specific instructions, which I am not sure I can fulfill, because it is not my faith. He also said to get in touch with someone in my area - another who is into 'Principalities.' While he was talking to me, telling me what to do, I began to have a horrible crushing pressure in my chest. I could not breathe properly and I wanted to vomit. I had to disconnect the call. I thought I was having a heart attack and needed to call 911. As soon as the call ended the symptoms ended.

I have not called the person recommended so because, tbh, I don't have a clue what these 'Principalities' people are, and even more honest, I am terrified that this thing might actually have the ability to end me. I thought I was dying in that car.

Does anyone have any input? I could use the help. Maybe an explanation about Principalities? And what the heck was happening with my chest? I've had a very thorough physical since then and my doctor says I am fine, no sign of issues."
"Bursts Of Colors And Ghosts At The Church","Maine","Haunted Places","Hey everyone! 

Its pink496 I am back. I am a lover of the paranormal world and I want to learn as much as I can. I love reading everyone's experiences. 😊

 The church that I am working at as a lot of activity going on. The church that I work at is huge! It's very big it has three floors but we only use two floors there are many rooms in the church. The church is used a lot. There is a kitchen, nursery for the babies. There are also many rooms in the church that are used for meetings and such.

 I was walking into a room and I saw this girl sitting in a chair. She was a teenager or young adult with blonde hair but she disappeared quick. I am sure she saw me as well because she looked shocked that I could see her. I will be in the preschool room setting up, and I will hear people talking in the nursery so I go in to see who it is and no one is there. I hear ghost talking all the time. But I can't make out what they're saying because I hear the voices from down the hall.

I have seen spirits out of the corner eye or spirits run across the room. I have seen shadow people since I was a little girl I always feel like someone is watching me mostly when I am at the church working and sometimes in my bedroom, but now I am seeing bursts of color in the air. My husband says that he sees it too. My husband has no clue what it could be. Just like pops of color, it's really cool looking but I am not sure what it means if it means anything lol I would love to hear what you think I wish all the best to you!-pink496"
"Strange Things Are Happening 2","Virginia","Haunted Places","My grandmother's house is extremely old and I get the creeps whenever I go over there. I know the house has a history.

 A young man committed suicide there in the late 1950s. One night, before I was even born my Aunt and Uncle decided to contact the spirit of the man by using a Ouija board. Nothing strange happened right away. However, as time went by my grandmother started seeing shadowy figures out of the corner of her eye. My Aunt and Uncle kept getting pinched by an unseen force. My grandmother kept getting her hair pulled. Eventually things settled down.

 Then, one night as my grandmother was cooking dinner a plate fell on the floor and smashed. Two more did the same thing. My family isn't bothered by the events that still occasionally occur in the house.

 One night I launched an investigation of my own and did an EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomena) session. I asked the normal questions like ""who are you?"", why are you here?"". I reviewed my recordings a few hours later and what I caught was absolutely incredible.

 I found out that the spirit in my grandmother's house is a young man named John McGovern who shot himself in 1956 at the age of 23. I researched the history of house and found the information. The EVP session caught a male voice saying ""John"" and ""Gun"".

 I live in a haunted house and so does my grandmother. I don't know what it is but my family seems to have a lot of paranormal experiences. As a paranormal expert and investigator I have experiences all the time. It's a common thing with me. I'm not at all bothered by my experiences because I have been doing this sort of thing for over 25 Years so I'm used to it. Anyway, thanks for reading and feel free to comment down below!"
"My Musical Home","Ohio","Haunted Places","In July of 2009, I bought a previously owned mobile home and relocated it onto my parents' property where my kids and I have lived since, and where most of our paranormal experiences have taken place. The following are music-related.

The first time I heard music in my home and couldn't find the source was Christmas evening that same year. I had been visiting with my parents and had just gotten home at 9:40pm. My kids were gone, so it was just me. When I opened my living room door I could hear music; not TV or radio music. It was more like whistling (think Andy Griffith) or like an instrument of some kind. As soon as I stepped into the living room, the music stopped. Believing it was our ghost (http://www.yourghoststories.com/real-ghost-story.php?story=10678), I said something like ""That was different. What were you doing?"" but didn't get a response. The whistle didn't come from a TV or radio; none were on. My desktop computer was on, but the speakers weren't, and it was on a website for purses. I know the noise came from inside my home because my dog Braxton walked up onto the deck with me and he didn't act like he heard anything at all outside. It was only after I opened the storm door that I heard it. And like I said, as soon as my foot hit the threshold, the whistling stopped. 

While meditating one night in June of 2010, I could hear conversation in my living room, along with old-fashioned piano music. I could hear the voices as plainly as if the TV was on, but low enough that I couldn't clearly understand what they were saying. I tried to isolate just one voice, and it came through pretty loudly (not yelling, more like a volume that had been turned up), but I still couldn't make out what was being said. I do know the voices weren't talking to me. It felt residual... They were just carrying on a conversation with each other. I could see the scene in my head as if those sounds were occurring in a saloon that just happened to be in my living room. I could almost imagine the tinkling sound of glass. It wasn't a solid sound, more like something that I should hear if I was really hearing sounds coming from a saloon. When I heard the tinny piano music, I imagined someone at a bar or a piano with a glass in their hand. That's what I should have heard and that's what my mind was trying to supply. The other sounds were distinct as well, except for not being able to decipher what they were saying. The saloon sounds went on for what seemed like at least 15-20 minutes but when I'm meditating, I lose track of time, so it could have been anywhere from 5 minutes to 30. Because of how busy (aka noisy) my work day, I try to keep my house as quiet as possible. When my kids are gone, I have no intrusive noises. I wasn't even listening to any music while meditating.

About a month later at 11:55 pm, I was sitting at the computer, chatting with zzsgranny before getting ready to call it a night. All at once I could hear voices coming from my right side. It sounded like a ball game was on. The voices were staticky, not too loud, but loud enough that I had no problem hearing them. I've always thought it was a baseball game because of the time of year, but whatever game was being broadcast was fast paced and action filled. There was no other sound except the click of the ceiling fan. All electronics in the living room were off, except my computer. 

Between 2010 and 2015, I have no record of any musical oddities. Until November 16th when I was woken at 1:45am and couldn't go back to sleep. While laying there, I heard music. It wasn't just instruments, there were females singing. The TV and radio were not on and I can't hear my kids' TVs, especially when my bedroom floor fan is on, as it always is. I never figured out what they were singing.

August of 2016, I was trying to get to sleep when I heard music in my bedroom. Like before, I couldn't identify the music, but it sounded instrumental. The music lasted about 10 minutes and then just faded away. This isn't the first time I have heard this type of music, but I never put it in my Journal. It was definitely prior to 2016; between 2010 and 2014. A few of those times someone else heard the music. The first time I had someone else witness it, I even turned off my fan and we still heard the music. On at least one of these occasions my kids weren't home, so I know it wasn't music coming from another room through the vents. 

Not very often, but occasionally I get to hear music I enjoy. Like January of 2017 when I was woken around 5:00am, blessed with rock music, KISS style. The only words I could make out were definitely rock style. It sounded like it was a radio station because after the first song I heard had ended, I heard a DJ say ""Mark Conway"" and ""summertime"". The radio then continued playing rock music. After another song or two played, another commercial came on. After the commercial was over, the radio became very staticky and loud. Eventually I said, ""Okay guys, either tune it in or turn it off."" Finally, the radio went off. I have only one radio in the whole house which hasn't been plugged in for over 2 years. None of our gadgets were on: my phone was on the charger, tablet was dead. No TV on, nothing that could explain the music. It was loud enough if it had been an actual radio station, my son should have been able to hear it and would have yelled for me to turn it down, and it would have woken my, at the time 2-yr-old, grandson. For the record, I did Google Mark Conway. To my surprise, there is an Irish musician named Mark Conway. I listened to a couple of his songs and really enjoyed them.

Within a day or two after being woken by rock music, I was tormented with Bluegrass Gospel. I don't like Bluegrass at all. Thankfully this didn't last as long as the rock, nor did it appear there was a hidden message in it. Just music. I just had to ride out the blasted Bluegrass.

The last time in 2017 that music was heard was in August. I was laying in bed waiting on my little one (grandson) to wake, when he said, ""What was that sound?"" I thought he was asleep until he looked up at me and asked me again. I told him it may have been the fan. He sat up, cocked his head a little and said, ""No, the fan doesn't sound like music. This is a song 'whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa' like that,"" he said. I didn't hear it but don't doubt he did.

The music started again in April of this year. One night I clearly heard what sounded like music coming from the living room. We were all in bed, nothing that could be playing music was on. A few nights later, I heard the words ""the wind up and pitch!"" I don't know who was playing, but it sounded like Marty Brennaman (voice of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team for those not familiar with our sports). I didn't hear the crack of the bat hitting the ball or anything after that, just ""the wind up and pitch!"" which was very loud and clear. When I hear things like this, I always either lean up or move my head so I can hear well. The sounds don't go away when I do that. 

Sometime between 9:00 and 9:30am early one May morning, while laying in bed, I heard females singing. I have no idea what musical genre it was; it was unfamiliar which basically means anything other than country or rock. The music was faint but sounded like it was coming from either my laundry room or kitchen, which are near my bedroom. I got up a few minutes later to go to the bathroom and the music had stopped.

A couple of days later, I was sitting on the couch watching Supernatural, when I heard what sounded to me like a radio commercial: men talking with background music. It definitely wasn't on the episode of Supernatural I was watching. 

Around 10:00pm the last of June, I heard music again. I don't know what genre it was, but I could almost make out the words. I heard a male singer and a guitar but there didn't appear to be any backup singers or other instruments. I checked with my oldest son, but he didn't have music on in the living room. My 4-yr-old (grandson) was in bed with me but he didn't hear it. I could still hear the music when I sat up. 

My last musical entry, for now, happened July 4th. It was 10:30pm when I heard the music. Again, I checked with my oldest son to see if he had music on in the living room and like before, he didn't. It took me a few minutes before I realized I know this song. It was Metallica's The Unforgiven. I don't believe it is a case of my subconscious supplying the song because for the previous three days I had Poison's Something to Believe In and Every Rose Has Its Thorn playing nonstop in my head.

In May of this year, I set my recorder when the boys and I left. When I finally had time to listen to the whole 7 hour recording, I heard a male (sounds like a teenager) say ""check""; three different times a female said something, or made a noise, that sounds like a strong ""t"" (tuh); I heard whispering several times but it isn't loud enough for me to decipher. And I heard music, which made me very happy."
"Mimicker","California","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","Back in 2013-2014 my dad moved in his girlfriend months after my mom died. She is a very selfish lady, she wasn't terrible to me but she still allowed us to live like that to benefit herself, so I am not a very big fan of her. Her and my dad are both addicts so it was easy for my dad to brush her off when she said she heard voices when she went to the bathroom and she could hear him talking to some other lady when no one else was in the room with him, it was in fact his main argument when they fought. Her hearing voices, her being crazy. Typical dumb fights, right? I unfortunately backed her up with the voices. 

 When I lived with my dad I use to lock myself in my room and I would always wait to leave my room once he left the house so I could avoid any contact with him. One day he and his girlfriend had left to run ""errands"" and my routine was to wait 5 minutes to make sure he didn't forget anything, after my 5 minute wait I made my way to the bathroom. Now this bathroom was extremely nice (my grandmother had it built the way she wanted it to be) it had two sinks and one large mirror with a shelf on the side, it had a wall that connected with the countertops and had a doorway to the toilet and shower area. Pretty spacious.

 I was in the bathroom doing my business web surfing on my little crappy flip phone when I heard a voice and I remember feeling like ""uh okay I'm the only up here but okay"" but I ignore it thinking I left Netflix on or my grandpa turned his tv up too loud so it becomes background noise, but the longer it goes the more I notice it sounds like two people conversing right outside the bathroom door. Intrigued I stopped my scrolling and tuned in more, it sounded like my dad and his girlfriend talking. Which wouldn't be a surprise if I hadn't had heard them leave, nor did I hear the front door open indicating that they came home or them go up the stairs that were right next to the bathroom and their bedroom. Now I'm freaked because not only is my dad not home but he's right outside the bathroom door talking to his girlfriend who is not there either. But I gather my thoughts and go out on a limb that the spirit believes I'm Lorri, my dads girlfriend (her name has been changed) and calmly talk to it ""Ghost, I know you like to freak Lorri out but I'm not Lorri, leave me alone please. I need to do my thing in peace"" and the voices abruptly stopped and the tension in the air lifted. It terrified my dad to know the spirits were torturing his poor spun out already somewhat crazy girlfriend. Things only amplified when he moved in her kids but those are for a different time!"
"The Room And Ouija","Connecticut","Ouija Board / Seances","I've posted plenty of other stories on here, and most of them have been more of a positive experience. The two I'm about to detail are the negative experiences in my life (all names changed, of course.) 

To start off, I live in a little village called Northfield, which is part of the town of Litchfield. Northfield is very soaked with history. The Northfield Knife Shop existed, and the remains of it are actually in my backyard, most of the houses on Main St where I live were actually owned by the Knife company. There are a lot of houses in town with plaques about who built the house and what year and so on, so the town/village dates back to Colonial times. 

The first story, which is just a quick, brief experience happened at my Landlord's house. He lives on the other side of town from where we rent his parent's house. He and his father built the house he lives in and it's a pretty nice house. There's two bedrooms up stairs, but only one is allowed to be used by my cousin. The other one is set up much like a 60s or 70s bedroom would be. He cares for the room and cleans it. But no one sleeps in there, no one is allowed to sleep in there, and it's just creepy. I've only ever been in the room once, and when I walked in, I swear the temperature dropped at least ten degrees, because I started to shiver. Lucky for me, my cousin wanted me to go see her room so we scurried out in a hurry. I have not been back up stairs in my landlord's house since. And I honestly never intend to.

Now to the absolutely terrifying experience.

My aunt, before she started to date my land lord, bought a house in town that used to be an old thrift store. The house was essentially one level, though there was a step up you had to take to get into the living room and access two of the bedrooms. My aunt has three daughters, Rachel, Sasha and Jenny. Jenny is the oldest, Rachel the youngest. All three girls lived with my aunt in the house.

This was back when I was somewhere between 8 and 14. Rachel is my age, and growing up, she was my absolute best friend. Sasha is a year older than me and Jenny is, I believe, four years older than me. My other aunt has a son and daughter, PJ and Destiny (the reason I mention them will come up again.) 

Sleepovers were a huge thing when I was younger. My entire family was a tight knit group so we were constantly sleeping over at each other's houses. This one night, I happened to sleep over with Rachel. Their house tended to constantly change; one day the living room was right inside the front door, the next my aunt moved it to the next room over. She was just indecisive, honestly. So this night, the living room was just inside the front door, opened to the kitchen and the foyer area. There was a step up into the office, which was occasionally the living room. On the wall opposite the step up and arch way (there was no door to the office) was a VERY large mirror that covered the entire wall. From the living room you could see all the way down into the master bedroom at the far end of the house. 

One night Rachel and I decided we didn't want to fight to share her bed, so we were going to sleep on the couch (which had two recliners). So she slept on one end and I on the other. I refused to sleep on the side next to the front door, as I hate not being able to face the door to any room I'm in. Anyways, I was laying on my right side facing towards the mirror, trying to fall asleep. We'd just finished watching movies and the wood burning stove in the living room was crackling and the only light. I saw a large dark mass standing in the archway looking out towards Rachel and I. Of course Rachel was sound asleep at this point, and I couldn't move. I just laid there staring at it through the mirror before it moved down into the foyer and then out the back door. I didn't sleep at all that night.

A few weeks later, Sasha's birthday party was coming up and my parents asked what she wanted. So she gave them a list. We went out and my parents found and bought her a Ouija board, which was on the top of her list. Now, I want to make it clear that I never once touched the board myself, or joined in on it. This is where Destiny and PJ come in.

After the night I was scared and couldn't sleep, I refused to sleep over at Rachel's. She would ask and I would tell her to sleep over at my house or no go. Rachel decided since I didn't want to sleep over, she would invite my cousin Destiny instead (Destiny is three years younger than us.) Anyway, PJ and Destiny spent the night at Rachel's house along with my older sister. Sasha decided that night was the perfect time for them to use the Ouija board. So they used it, asked questions, got answers and laughed it all off - accusing Destiny of messing with them. Because the board, or someone, spoke to them pretending to be our dead grandmother. (My paternal grandmother, not my maternal one who is mentioned in other stories.) 

My cousins decided to then turn all the lights in the house off and play hide and seek in the dark. PJ was it and was going through the house looking for the girls. He got into the office where there was a dog cage. He saw a small dark human figure in the cage crouched and he assumed it was Destiny or Rachel. He reached into the cage and the figure immediately disappeared. He also firmly believes and states that the temperature inside the cage was much colder than the rest of the house.

After that, my cousin Sasha was sitting in the living room painting her nails. This was months later, closer to Summer time. She was home alone and focused on her toes when something flew across the living room, just barely past her head, hit the mirror and then fell down. It was a battery, that had been all the way on the other end of the house. The activity kicked up in the house after that, and I had a hard time just going into the house even during the day, because it's always felt like you're being watched, no matter what room you're in. The house just has the most uncomfortable feeling to it. I can't even walk onto the property anymore without feeling weird.

When I would go into the house, it always felt like someone was screaming at me to get the hell out. Like I was not welcome there. And I think they honestly opened a portal in the house. Because a LOT of scary shiat happened there to my cousins, though they rarely talk about it anymore. I am almost certain that the board also strengthened the menacing man who watched me as I tried to sleep as well.

Ironically, Sasha ended up moving into the house with her baby and husband shortly after she gave birth. I don't know if anything has gone on since then, because Sasha and I haven't spoken to each other since our grandfather died.

I know my own experience in the stories were brief, but I wanted to share these. This is the only story I've ever had happen to my family that involved using a Ouija Board, and I don't think it will ever happen again."
"Strange Things Are Happening","Virginia","Haunted Places","I live in a house that was built in 1938. Eighty year old houses aren't exactly my thing. So when we moved to an actual house for the first time after living in a trailer park for three years, I wasn't exactly looking forward to it. 

About five years ago my dad put an old mattress in the attic and leaned it against a few boxes. We went out for lunch and when we came back a few hours later, the mattress had tipped over because we heard a crash and went to investigate. 

I slept in a room right next to the attic and I always heard the door slamming shut when it was already closed. I have only been inside the attic once or twice but it is creepy as hell. The door opens and closes by itself still and I still hear scratching noises. We already checked the crawlspace to see if there were any rodents and there were none. It could've been a mouse or squirrel but I have my thoughts. 

I've also experienced my TV turning on by itself. My laundry​ room had its share of activity as well like towels being thrown around by themselves and laundry soap disappearing and reappearing. I still live there today and my chandelier sometimes swings by itself. 

I'm not really bothered by the disturbances although I do sleep on the couch now. I love everything about the paranormal. I have always been fascinated by ghosts. I have more encounters that I would like to share with you guys as well. 

I am thinking of moving up north sometime in the future but that has nothing to do with my experiences. I believe that whatever is currently in my house is friendly and I have no reason to fear for my family or my safety. Thanks for reading!"
"Man Cave Ghost","Connecticut","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","This account is mainly the stories my family members have shared as well as family friends. I have had one experience with this particular ghost myself, but it was pretty brief (obviously names are changed and not actual names, aside from the ghost's nickname). 

The house I live in was built in the mid 50s. The house is essentially the same as the day it was finished back then. Hardwood floors, awkward shaped hallway, kitchen with the stove in the counter and the oven in the wall, and so on. The basement is half finished, the garage is built directly into the basement beneath my parents' room, then there is a sliding barn door that leads to the laundry room, which also has a half bath. There's a giant room you can access from the garage and the laundry room which has a fireplace and was originally the first owner's man cave. I'm going to call him by his actual nickname, because I actually do not know his real name. We call him Papi. Papi had a bar attached to his man cave, and said bar is also still there. 

The first account I can recall of Papi was my sister's fiance. My older sister Tina moved in with her fiance, Scott. Scott was honorably discharged from the Marines after he did two tours of Afghanistan and one tour in Africa. He was blown up twice in the process, has bad hearing in one ear, PTSD, and so on and so forth. They had been living in North Carolina, but once he was discharged, they moved back here to Connecticut to find somewhere to live. My mom offered them the empty basement room to stay in while they find a house. Scott was laying in bed, playing on his xbox. The rest of us were upstairs in the kitchen and living room. Scott's account was that he saw a man walk past the door in the laundry room. He saw the man again twice that night after. And we're pretty sure it was Papi. Because it is a known fact that Papi is in the house.

Fast forward, Scott and Tina moved out and into an apartment. My oldest sister Kari moved in after she broke up with a long abusive boyfriend. So she was living in the basement room. One night, she looks up and sees a man standing in the doorway watching her. She freaked out, but wasn't afraid. She was pretty sure he was just curious.

Now, onto mine. We have a wood burning stove in the basement attached to the fireplace so that we can heat the house in the winter. (We do have oil and that heats up water that heats the house, but using the wood burning stove saves us money.) So I was downstairs putting wood on the fire. I turned to grab some more wood and looked up, Papi was standing there in the doorway watching me. He quickly disappeared after that.

He smoked a pipe, and his choice of tobacco was a fruity flavor and smelling type, which I find myself getting a face full of every now and then, sometimes inside the house, sometimes on the property. His old knife shop is actually in our back yard as well, and is collapsing. (His son (my landlord) was offered by multiple museums, including the Smithsonian, to take the shop and all the items in it, but he refused.) I do have a few blades from the shop actually in the house, my mom and I gathered them when we first moved in. I don't see Papi as being negative. I have had negative experiences, but... Generally the house I live in gives me very positive feelings. I honestly think Papi is protecting the house and my family. 

Also, since my mother put Papi's favorite beer in the basement, half of a six pack of it, we have not seen him since. And, the beer has actually gone missing. We cannot find it."
"A Memory I Won't Forget","Maine","Haunted Places","Hey everyone! I am excited to be here. I have been reading your ghost stories for a while and I love this site. This is my first time sharing my experience on this site. 

I was 18 years old at the time so this is almost 9 years ago but I do remember it like it just happened. At this time I was living in a city in an apartment with my kids father and his mom and brother (I am not with my kids father anymore. I am married to my soul mate). 

It was summer time and we all would hear someone running upstairs all the time when all of us would be downstairs. Sometimes we would hear what sounded like a little boy playing with a ball. He would bounce a ball and be running upstairs and that happened a lot. Sometimes when I was in a room upstairs watching TV, I would hear a little boy talking softly. I would open the door and no one would be there. Things like that would happen. 

I know that my kids father and his mother would hear the little boy too. We would talk about the little boy and how we must have a ghost in our house. It never freaked us out much because the little boy seemed friendly. I think he wanted us to play with him. We didn't mind him being there, and he didn't seem to mind us being there either. 

One day my boyfriend, his mother Jan, his brother Paul, and I decided to go to the fair. It was fun but I was ready to go home after a few hours. It was hot outside and there were a lot of people there. My boyfriend at the time and I walked home and Jan and Paul stayed. 

When we got home I wanted to watch a movie so we did. The movie was about to end and we were upstairs and in this apartment when you're upstairs it's hard to hear what's going on downstairs. So we have like ten minutes left and I hear a little boy talking and then a knock at the door. I thought it was Paul trying to bug us because he was 13 at the time and loved to always be with us. I opened the door and no one was there so me and my boyfriend go downstairs and no one is there. His mom and Paul come home 30 minutes later. They both said that they were not even home. 

All of us were a bit freaked out. Later I found out that our apartment was built on what used to be a train station where people would stay overnight sometimes to wait for their train to come. A lot of shady and terrible things would happen there such drugs and rapes. 

I have always been really sensitive to the spirit world. I have dreams that come true sometimes and I can also see spirits. I wish everyone here all the best. I do have another experiences that I will share later.

"Being Watched Since Birth","Maryland","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I was born on Friday the 13th. It all started when I was a young child. I spent my infancy until 2nd grade in a big old mansion. My parents moved there when I was born. My mom tells me that the second we moved there my dad, who is against all paranormal beliefs, immediately thought it was haunted and wanted to move out. 

I was about 4 years old and playing with Barbies and my friend starts to scream. She said she saw the Barbie turn its head and stare her in the eyes.

When I was 8 we moved to Maryland. A tiny house in the woods on the water. The exact second I moved there I felt extremely uncomfortable and remember the feeling of being watched. The first occurrence I can remember was during my sleepover at age 9. I'm up talking to my friend. We immediately stop talking and don't know why. We pretend to go to sleep as a man walks into my room, opens and shuts my drawers and goes back to sleep. The next morning I wake up and ask my family who came in the night before. They had no idea what I was talking about. To follow, every night I would hear pots and pans clanging in the middle of the night.

Every time I was in a certain hallway I would sprint through it, not knowing why. Now that I look back I realize a presence was probably there. I would run so fast and literally was 10 years old. My doors would open and shut and I'd hear creaking under my bed at all times. I'd see black cats at night time on my street. I ALWAYS felt like someone was watching.

Flash forward to now, being 18 years old, I still feel that same feeling. I have doorknobs turn I hear banging on doors and will be home alone with the door locked and look behind me to a wide open door. Not sure what to do. I will be driving late at night and hear someone in the trunk of my car but I check and no one is there. When I was younger, every single time I was home alone the wifi would cut out the TV would go to static and the home phone wouldn't dial. Every time I find myself watching a horror movie, I seem to relate to them in a certain way.

Not sure what to do, I don't think whatever these presences are have an evil intention, but I can literally feel in the air when they are there."
"Rita And Her Children - Pt 2","Georgia","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I know it's been a while since my last entry about the presence Rita. This new entry shall be an update on the things that have been happening these past several months. The womanly apparition is still with me as well as the little shadowlings, who I've lovingly adorned with names Mischief and Mayhem. Yes, I did say 'lovingly'.

A while ago, I was trying everything I could think of to get rid of the trio (before, I thought there were several little shadowlings with Rita, but now I've realized there's only two), but to no avail. I tried burning sage, I made salt lines, brick dust lines, I even had my friend's uncle who's a preacher bless the house- nothing helped. She did not go away. There were lulls where I didn't see her for a few weeks at a time, but she always came back. Ya'll, at one point, I think I even hurt her feelings, as crazy as that might sound. 

As I mentioned in my previous entry, I never felt as if Rita or the shadowlings were evil entities, but whenever they came around my energy would be drained. Luckily, that's not so much the case now that I've actually welcomed them into my life. I know the majority of you are probably screaming ""Why the hell would you do that?"", and yes I know, welcoming a force into your life only strengthens it, but it's okay. Rita, as I've come to realize, is okay. Let me explain.

A few months back, during one of the periods when I had not encountered Rita for a while, I went on a 4 day trip with my friends to Saint Augustine, Florida (beautiful place, by the way). Things were great, and we were having tons of fun. My energy was back, I had been sleeping, and I was getting to the point where I wasn't constantly looking over my shoulder. We were sitting on the beach just talking and laughing when this middle-aged woman came up to us. She, like everyone else, was just a regular beach goer so we didn't think anything of her approaching us.

She introduced herself politely, and then looked directly at me. She said my name, which took me by surprise because we hadn't given her our names, but I figured maybe she had just overhead one of my friends say it. She asked if she could sit for a few moments and we told her she could. 

I remember the conversation vividly because of the strangeness. She asked ""Do you mind if I read your aura to you?"" I was taken aback, but then I sort of giggled, thinking she was joking. She just smiled, but her eyes were serious. My friends played along and told me to let her do it. Finally, I agreed.

She took my hands, flat and palm down in hers, and she looked me straight in the eyes. Her eyes were super intense, and I felt like she was looking right through me. ""You have a highly empathic soul. That's what drew me to you. Your light stood out to me. But, negativity can feed off that light. She wants to protect you, you know? You're lucky to have a guardian. Don't fight her away."" After that, the woman kissed my forehead, got up and walked away.

To say they least, I was dumbfounded. My friends laughed it off saying she was probably drunk, but I thought hard about what she said. The fact that she said don't fight HER away was a bit troubling to me because I immediately thought of Rita, but then I remembered how drained and tired I would feel after a visit from Rita.

One week later, I was back from vacation and home alone watching TV. It was about 11pm, and my sister and brother-in-law had went out to catch a late movie. I had had a few glasses of wine, so I was pretty relaxed. The back door of the house is at the kitchen, and I heard the doorknob being jiggled. I thought it was just them coming home, and I remember being annoyed because we NEVER use the back door, so I had to get up from my comfortable position to unlock it.

I look outside, and it's someone dressed in black trying to break into the house. The person didn't see me, so I hid and began to call 911. Then, I hear the glass window on the door break, and he unlocked the door. The operator was on the phone, but I was too scared to talk because this intruder was about 5 feet from where I was hiding. So, I heard him walk around the kitchen to the living room rummaging through stuff, and that's when I start talking to the operator.

I was in full panic mode and froze. Nothing like this had ever happened before to me, and I was scared he would find me before the cops got there. I heard a loud thump in the hall and a ""What the f***?"" Then, there was another thump and the guy gasps and I heard his feet shuffling quickly as he ran past me out the door.

By that time, the cops were there and apprehended him. They calmed me down and got my statement, all the while I hear the guy saying that there was another person in the house, and the cops checked, but there was no one else. The intruder said that someone pushed him hard against the wall, another person in black, but he told them it wasn't me, that he hadn't even known I was there. A patrol car sat outside my house until my sister and brother-in-law got home.

I honestly do believe that it was Rita. I think she scared the intruder off and protected me that night, because all I could think about was what the woman said at the beach. It wasn't until a week after that incident that she came again, and I didn't allow myself to be frightened of her. She stood in the corner of my room and, like always, all I could make out was a dress and bright green eyes, and the two shadowlings moved around the room like they always did.

That was the night I invited her into my life. I thanked her. I accepted her as my guardian of sorts. That's been about 3 months ago, and now when she comes to me I don't feel drained and tired. I believe that she has protected me from other situations in my life in the past, but I didn't realise it, and I'm thankful that she is around."
"A Haunted Mountain","New York","Haunted Places","I often hang out with a friend who was my roommate in college. I've written about our experiences at college under another account on here, but this time is about a mountain we go to sometimes.

His uncle owns an entire mountain in the Catskills and it's a beautiful area and we often go hunting there as there's lots of land. But that entire area is awash in paranormal activity, and this mountain is no different. I have had two experiences, one just as scary as the other. 

The first one was during deer season. My friend put me up in a tree stand that overlooked the open areas of the mountains and could see all the barns and the house. I was up there for maybe an hour, hadn't seen anything so I was scrolling through Facebook on my phone, and then I hear something strange. I look up and I see some movement in a distant field maybe 400 yards away and what sounded kind of like drums. I raised my gun and looked through the scope, and it was 8 or 9 people dancing together in a circle, mostly (apparently) males, many of them shirtless. I get on my radio and talk to my friend who was down in the woods maybe 300 yards in the opposite direction, and described him the situation, I also asked how many people were home, and he said no one was at the time.

I watched for maybe 5 minutes before the drumbeats faded and the people disappeared one by one. My friend said it was likely Native American spirits practicing their ancient rituals.

The second incident was when we were just walking up the hill. We came to an opening, it was an old overgrown field, not very large, and there were a couple of old rusty cars laying around. We got to a small knoll and maybe 75 yards away from us there was an old well, the kind that's circular and you had to drop a bucket down into, broken down and old, but not in too bad of shape all things considered. What happened next left us paralyzed and gave me (and maybe him) several sleepless nights.

A man came climbing up out of the well, old style clothes and a beard. When he got up, he stopped and looked all around, and despite us being right there, didn't seem to notice us at all. He then ran into the woods and disappeared. Apparently some unsavory characters used to dispose of bodies down that well. I don't know if it was a full bodied apparition of a victim or something more sinister."
"Haunting Here In Maine","Maine","Haunted Places","I live here on the coast of Maine and I own an old Dutch colonial house. I am a firm believer of the paranormal, weird things have happened to me since I was a young boy. Like I saw one day, rabbit hunting in Lovell Maine, a man standing on a stone wall and he was no more than three foot high. Amazed to what I saw, I turned to watch him saunder off down the stone wall, and he disappeared like the blowing of the wind, I never seen or anything like that again. 

Now present day, my house is haunted. My wife and I were making a quilt, I was standing back to the kitchen and my wife was sewing the quilt, when she saw our cat playing with a very bright orb. My wife saw it and I caught out of the corner of my eye, our cat was standing in front of the stove and he was reaching for or playing with the orb. It just vanished between his paws, the brightness of the orb looked like an old time flash from a camera. 

That's not all that's happened here. I was renovating my kitchen so when I started tearing into the walls and by God there between the walls was a perfectly framed out door with a threshold. Well I thought it was cool, I wanted to keep it and close in our doorway. Well my family was freaked out, I said it's a doorway nothing else. A week goes by and I'm doing work there in the area of the doorway, I turned my head and saw the figure of a man, an old man, at the bottom of my stairs, he stared up the cellar stairway at me. I stopped and looked again and he was gone. I closed the door back up in the wall, sealing it in. My family is happy that I did, they all got bad vibes from it being exposed.

 One more thing happened at Christmas one year. It was a wicked blizzard and we lost the power, so I get the generator out and set up to to power my pellet stove. I did that for the heat. It was screaming outside so my daughter built a little shelter with blankets and chairs and we heated the house and watched a movie. Well we fell asleep and around 3 in the morning, something woke me and I looked into the hallway and this lady in a pale blue smock said,""what lovely music you listen to.""

 I went back and camped in the living room with my daughter. The next morning I asked my wife if she came downstairs in the middle of the night she said no. She was in bed all night, as I took care of the generator all night.

 That was weird, and all my daughter's friends that have stayed at our place have seen the lady that I described to my wife. I have researched property owners and one person sticks out of all the rest; Florence E. She owned my property decades ago, maybe it was her we're being visited by.

 My screen name is lightkeeper because of my dad, he was in the coast guard and retired. He has told me many ghost stories about the lighthouse he was stationed at. I don't want to be long winded I'll save those hauntings for another time. Thank you"
"My Encounter With Shadow People And Green Orb","West Virginia","Shadow People","I have been visited by shadow people numerous times and have always been paralyzed with fear, however, this experience was unlike any I have ever had. I was not paralyzed by fear and actually extended my hand through one of the figures. Not only did I see four figures and a demonic cat with red eyes attached to the wall above the window, a green orb appeared. I was so shocked by the experience I immediately drew a picture of what I saw and wrote in my journal a very detailed account of what happened. This is not some story I made up, this did happen to me. I have not been visited since this last occurrence. I have two Ph.D's, one in Medicine and one in Divinity. I have an IQ of 149 and I have 70 published works. I have been reluctant to discuss this with anyone who has not brought it up first due to the fear of being shunned. My written account of the events are on my Booksie site, in the hope that someone had the same experience and we could discuss it, this has not happened.

Around 2:40 to 2:45 am December 6th 2014 I was dreaming of my Grandmother and I was talking in my sleep. I know I was because I have done so for a long time and I hear myself talking in my sleep but do not realize I am asleep. I asked her a question, some question about does she love me or something related to that.

 At that moment I saw a grayish creature upon the top left of the window. It was small about the size of a large cat or small dog, had a human/demonic looking head with gray skin and reddish eyes and brought instant fear to me. It had thin arms and legs and was in a crouched like sitting position sort of like a cat poised to strike. Oddly it was attached to the wall as if it were defying gravity and was facing downward and to the right, like a crooked painting on the wall it perched. After I saw it and it made contact with my eyes, I instantly had a sense of complete fear and felt almost frozen with fear. 

I did not move but then on the right side of the bed, from the perspective of one sleeping, in the corner of the room was a green laser looking light that seemed to be shining in all directions but not at once, as if it were scanning the room. It was very much like a laser bar scanner's beam of laser light but was an intense light green. The scanning only lasted for about five seconds, then the light went out and emerged was a ball of green light, not as bright as the light that was scanning or emanating in different directions. The ball was about the size of a softball, or maybe slightly larger but smaller than a bowling ball. It moved quite fluidly, smoothly and at a steady rate at about waist level from the corner that it originated from straight up to waist height then it hovered horizontally along the right side of the bed until it reached the end of the bed, turned left and went to the front center of the bed, then started moving towards me. I was in an upright position when I saw the green scanning light trying to look over the bed without moving too much because I did not want to interfere or scare whatever it was away if that makes any sense. I was curious and had an open mind about the existence of other dimensions etc.

 I was laying on my right side with my right arm supporting my body perching me up some when the green ball instantly lost all color and changed to the exact shape of a person with no body. The person was a silhouette which was difficult to see through like smoke or like looking through translucent glass with a black cloud around it. I made a decision that since I had seen this green ball several other times over the past few years and since it had never come close to me that I would attempt to feel it. I raised my left hand and passed it through the black cloud that surrounded the silhouette which looked like translucent glass and the object instantly disappeared and I felt nothing, no form, no cold, no hot, just air. I then said out loud it's okay, I am not going to harm you, all are welcome, your safe here.

I had said that exact same thing several weeks ago when I noticed four or five black gaseous shadows of people around the bed, whose bodies were the same shape as a human but were elongated or stretched. I have seen these dark shadows on many occasions over the past year and it hasn't been until recently that I read about the existence or supposed existence of what is called shadow people.

 The description I read online was exactly the same thing I have seen many times, and when I first started seeing them I was so fear stricken that I could not move, but now I am not afraid and when I do see them I tell them, it's okay, your safe, I am not going to hurt you, all are welcome here. I know it sounds like I need a Thorazine drip or a lobotomy but this is what I saw and I believe what I saw.

 I was not asleep because I was sitting up leaning on my right arm, looking around and as soon as I passed my hand through the silhouette and it disappeared, I got out of bed, used the bathroom and got a flashlight and put it in bed with me. By this time, it was a little after 3 am and I did not see anything else.

 I am as clueless as anyone could be but there are things about our universe we do not understand or things that are beyond our comprehension and our wildest dreams. I personally believe that when we die our spirit or soul whatever you may call it, or consciousness transcends to a different plane of existence, another dimension, and a higher one. These souls can see us and sometimes even interact with us but since we are in a dimension lower than them, we cannot interact with them at all, hence when I tried to touch the translucent silhouette of a person it disappeared instantly. I don't know if perhaps some other beings if I can classify it as that, are able to transcend between two different planes of both consciousness and dimensions.

 As I was saying about death, when we are alive we are bound to a spiritual Earth-bound plane and in death, we transcend to another sphere of consciousness in another dimension. Like I mentioned before, this is just my own thoughts and theory. I would love to know if anyone has had an experience even remotely similar and I am completely open to all comments, good, bad, ugly, pretty; I don't' care, all I care about is knowing the truth. I just want to know. 

But there is also one thing about knowing that bothers me, it seems to come at a price. The more I pay attention to these occurrences, the more I interact with these occurrences, the more frequent they are happening and the more spectacular things are becoming.

 I knew that another dimension or sphere of consciousness exists because shortly after my grandfather died I heard very loud bangs or slams in the kitchen for about 6 months after he had passed away. It sounded like a can of soup being slammed on the counter. I had no pets at that time and I was the only one who was in my new home. What is strange is that my grandfather lived in a tiny trailer, very small only 8 by 30 feet. I think it was an old construction trailer, but anyway, he died of asbestosis and emphysema and he basically starved himself to death. After his Father died a month earlier, he just lost all will to live. I watched him go downhill quick and my Mother called me one night at work and said she was on her way home from the veteran's hospital with pop in the car, he wants to die at home. He had regained consciousness after the doctors had put a C PAP with pure oxygen on him for 48 hours to bring his CO2 levels down. He asked my Mother what was this thing on my face. She told him it's a C PAP and it's keeping you alive. He asked her what happens if I take it off, she said you will die. He said to take it off and take me home. 

She drove like a race car driver, going well over 120 and was stopped by a state trooper, who was an idiot because he wanted to check with the VA Hospital first before letting her go, he could clearly see my grandfather dying in the passenger seat dressed in VA pajamas, and at this time he had lost consciousness as his CO2 levels continued to rise. She could not wait any longer and took off in her Volkswagen Passat at full speed, leaving the trooper behind. 

To make a long story short, my Mother asked my grandfather a few questions while he still could speak in the car. She asked him if he was scared and he said yes, she asked if it hurt he said no. That was about all he said as she raced to his little trailer so he could die in his own bed with his dog at one side and my Mother and me at the other holding his hand. I was at the trailer waiting, I drove about 140mph on the interstate in my mustang from the Hospital that I worked at, a trip that usually took 25 minutes, I made in under 10.

 As soon as she pulled up she screamed for me to get him in the house, I opened the passenger door, grabbed him and picked him up, which was extremely difficult since he was limp, although when I thought I was about to lose my grip his right hand gripped my shirt. That was the last action he made.

 I placed him in bed, we turned on his oxygen machine just to have an old familiar sound in the background. Harry, his dog jumped into bed and was under his left hand. We talked to him about all the good times we had had with him over the years, recalling old memories and funny stories, and a little more than 4 hours later my grandfather took his last breath at 3:34 am.

 After his last breath, he had a look of complete horror on his face, a look that has haunted me since. My Mother was also horrified and looked at me, she said it's okay, go with the angels. She was afraid he was fighting it, but it was over. I truly believe it was his consciousness refusing to pass on, or it was his consciousness looking at the fires of hell. I don't know, but it was the most scared face I have ever seen. I have not seen anyone else die who made a face of horror after their last breath.

 We stripped his old pajamas off, gave him a nice bath, put new pajamas on him, his VA pajamas were his favorite, and we placed a ripped piece of cloth around his head and jaw to keep his mouth closed while the muscles began to set. He was cremated and his ashes are yet to be scattered.

 That was hard to talk about, but after he died we removed his trailer and I moved a new one in its place, a much larger of course. The kitchen is located exactly where his bed would have been if you place his old mobile home where I live now. That is where the loud noises came from and I didn't associate it with him at all until it stopped and I talked with my Mother about it and she also felt his presence. So now I often say, hi Pop when I hear a strange noise in the house, but there have not been any noises in the house since a year after he died, only the occasional shadowy figures and the balls of green light.

 I know that my Grandfather, all of those whom I have loved that have passed on to the next higher dimension visit from time to time. It may be spooky at first, but once you become accustomed to it and know what's going on, it becomes something to look forward to."
"My Most Horrifying, Unforgettable Week","Texas","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I'd moved to Texas to live with my mom during my first pregnancy, since I had no support system in my hometown.

 I lived with her for about a year before the issues started up. It was around nine o'clock at night, and my mom, stepfather, and I were sitting at the dining table, and I had my six-month-old son on my lap. He was refusing to sleep, and I didn't want him to wake my step siblings by fussing loudly in my room (across the hall from the kids' rooms, and he was a very loud child when he was unhappy), so I figured him being with me would help calm him enough to sleep. All of a sudden, he just froze in my lap, stiff as a board, and stared at the corner of the living room. I noticed he wasn't fidgeting any more and followed his gaze, but nothing was there. It was just an empty corner. I got my mom's attention, and she looked at the corner as well, but she didn't see anything there, either.

 My son started pointing at the corner, crying quietly; my mom walked across the room, ran her hand around the corner but felt nothing, and came back. Within moments, my son stopped staring and leaned against my chest, falling asleep in a few minutes. I laid him down in his crib, turned on some music, and left him there until I was ready to go to bed myself. I thought nothing of the shadows I saw moving in the hall through the crack between the bottom of my door and the floor, assuming they were just my stepfather checking on his kids. 

Only two days later, it happened again, but this time, my son's crying wasn't quiet. My mom checked the corner, my son finally fell asleep still sniffling, and I put him to bed. I went out onto the back deck for a cigarette at ten-thirty before I headed for bed, and when I came back inside, my stepfather (we'll call him Dale) stopped me and said, ""He's okay, but... Who's that woman?"" 

""What woman?"" I asked, because I couldn't see anyone near my room, and there were no new photos on the walls.

""The woman there, in front of your door. She's got short curly hair, and she's short and skinny. She's wearing a button-down shirt and long jean skirt. 

""Dale, you're drunk. There's no one there,"" I said, but I knew the description - it was exactly how my grandmother looked when she was younger, and he had never met her; she'd died almost two years before this point. I chalked it up to him, as I said, being drunk and remembering a description my mother might have told him. 

The next three nights went much the same. We lost the house within the next month, due to my stepfather not being able to work because of a car accident, so my mom and Dale took the kids an hour and a half away to stay with Dale's parents while my son and I stayed behind to finish packing the house up. It was the easiest for all of us - Mom and Dale could focus on the kids and finding a new place, and I could focus on my son and packing without having to deal with the fuss that comes from three kids all close in age and reaching the point where they rarely got along. The first night was fine; I got the kids' belongings in boxes, and half of my room was organised and ready to be packed up. The second evening is when it started. 

I'd just laid my son down in bed, gotten the Disney station started up for him, and shut the door behind me when I heard the whispering. I opened my door again, but all I could hear was Colors of the Wind. The whispering got louder when I reached the living room, and it seemed to come from what was my mom's room. I hurriedly shut the door, turned on ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" on the television, and forced myself to focus on packing things up. I eventually fell asleep on the couch around one AM. 

The next night, I was smoking before bed and on the phone with my friend we'll call Bryan, talking about nothing in particular. I fell silent as I realised there were four dark figures standing in my backyard, halfway between the deck and the back fence. They didn't move at all but they were there. I took a picture on my phone, but the photo didn't show anything. I went inside, made sure all doors and windows were locked, and broke my own rule of smoking in the house. I didn't go back outside until the sun was up. Once I finally fell asleep, it didn't last long - I woke up to the feeling of someone watching me, the hairs on the back of my neck standing straight up and goosebumps all over my body. 

The music came the following night. Big band, 50s style music, crackling and fluctuating in volume and eerily haunting, coming from my mom's room. My son wouldn't sleep in our room, screaming every time I tried to lay him down. So I made him a bed of extra comforters on the living room floor; he was asleep within minutes. I ignored the music as much as I could, but it was difficult. It played for three hours before suddenly cutting off, leaving the house in silence. The figures in the backyard were there again.

The fifth night I stayed in that house alone was also the final night. I'd become accustomed to the haunting strains of old music, the terrifying shadows in the backyard, the faint whispering, even the feeling of something being in the house with my son and me. But nothing could ever have prepared me for what happened that final night. I'd made sure the dishes were washed and put away; laundry run through the machines, folded, and put away in boxes; and trash bagged up and ready to be put in the cans outside. I fell asleep to the sound of Alfred Hitchcock talking on the TV, the 50s music coming from my mom's room, and soft voices speaking too fast and too quietly for me to understand. I woke up in less than two hours, unable to breathe. It felt like I was being strangled, thick fingers around my throat, and a harsh, growling breathing in my ears. I was sobbing, my son was screaming, and I couldn't move. The sensation was gone as suddenly as it came, and I stumbled to my feet, picked up my son to comfort him, and headed into the kitchen for a drink. I know I had put away every single dish and piece of silverware, because I sent my mom a picture when I was done, with the caption of ""See, Mom? I'm not being lazy!"" But there, on the island counter, was our largest butcher knife, and as I stated at it, it started almost vibrating, wiggling across the countertop before rising about an inch in the air. I screamed and ran back into the living room, stuffing my son rather haphazardly into his car seat before running to my room to gather up clothes and drag his mattress from the crib. I shoved bottles and formula and diapers and wipes into a large duffel bag, the clothes into my book bag, and left it by the door while I ran my son out to the car as a guttural laugh echoed in the house. I nearly wrecked the car trying to reverse out of our driveway. I called my mom as I drove toward where they were staying, asking for directions and crying too hard to explain what happened. My phone died before I was even halfway there. 

Dale's mom didn't believe me when I got there, but I know Mom and Dale did - they'd seen the benevolent stuff, the less frightening occurrences, and so it wasn't a far leap from just presences to what I experienced that night. When I went to show them pictures and let them listen to the audio of the music from their room, everything was gone. Not just deleted, or silent audio clips, but the data wasn't there at all. 

Last I heard, the people who moved in after us left the house in just as much of a hurry as I did that night, and the neighbour across the street went in to clean it up (and probably take things that were left behind) but couldn't get past the front door before she felt like she was being strangled. Now the land has an enormous crack through it and the house was in ruins for over a year before the city decided to tear it down."
"The Chocolate Shop Ghost","Illinois","Haunted Places","The old building had been a gas station prior to being remodeled into a candy store, by a prominent company. With the large, plate glass windows on three sides and the over large side door to what had once been the bay area and now served for deliveries, to me it still felt like a gas station. The fact that it hadn't been one in over 35 years, didn't matter. I'm guessing it didn't to the resident ghost either.

 I started working there around 2004, mostly the night shift, and often alone. Because of the economy, business was often quite slow, as we were not a penny candy store but high end chocolates. It didn't take me long to figure out, even on nights I worked alone, I wasn't alone. 

First, there were the feelings I got; that cob-webby tingling on the back of my neck and sometimes almost my entire body, accompanied by the feeling of being watched.

 The only station the radio would stay tuned to was a country station. Literally, you could change the station, but within a few minutes it would dial itself back to the country one. 

 Now and then, you'd catch a whiff of oil and grease, accompanied by sounds of movement. Sometimes, I could swear I heard the sound of an air compressor. 

 As with most places I've worked at, I ended up keeping a few useful tools at the store, because I tend to be little miss fix it. I had my kit stored on a shelf below the phone, I'd go to get something and my kit would be missing. It always turned up in the same place - back in what had been the bay area, on the shelving where a mechanic would keep it. Hard to blame co-workers when it decides to transport itself, while you're the only one there. After a couple of months of this, I said ""Ok, I'll keep it here - but no messing with it, ok?"" They never moved again. Although if I left a tool laying out, I'd find it back in the kit.

 The start of my shift overlapped the ending of another's shift. So for an hour or so, I wasn't alone. I was mildly surprised when co-workers started to confine in me they thought the place was haunted. Some of them as they were quitting. Not that anything bad had happened, they were just that unnerved by it. Some of the things they reported were sounds coming from the store room (old bay area), things moving from where they were left, boxes flying off the shelves, things of that ilk. We had one worker who adored rap music. Since she insisted on trying to play it, the radio kept unplugging itself. It was country or nothing. 

 I have to admit, the first time I heard what sounded like someone in the back, when I knew I was alone, had me going out the front doors, and circling the building checking to make sure the side bay door was indeed closed and locked. After that, I formed the habit of checking them before the other person left. 

 One night, working in the bay area putting away stock, I distinctly heard a male voice say ""George, Ma'am."" It was deep and country sounding. 

I looked about, ""Hello?"" Nothing, but I was tingling like mad. ""Unless you say different, I'm going to assume that's your name. Alright?"" Still nothing. After that we just started referring to him as George. I never mentioned why I thought this was his name to my coworkers. If asked I'd just shrug and say, ""Gotta call him something right?"" 

 As I mentioned, I often worked alone at night, and sometimes someone would come in and they just would not feel 'right' to me, especially if they started asking odd questions, like if we had cameras, because they couldn't see any, or asking me if I wasn't afraid to be working all alone, if we had many customers that day. To me it felt as if they were fishing for information. We'd hear noise from the back room, as if someone was in the back. I'd smile sweetly and say, ""Oh, I'm not alone. George is here."" This was generally met with an ""oh,"" and a fairly quick retreat on their part, if their 'concern' wasn't real. Otherwise they'd just finish up their small talk and move along. Thankfully that didn't happen often.

 One afternoon I was working with another woman who truly believed we were haunted. Only she's the type who thinks all spirits are demons, and voiced her opinion that we simply MUST exorcise George from the building, before he showed his true colors by possessing one of us. At that moment a fearful toppling of boxes from the shelves could be heard. We both rushed to the area, and she gasped. There on the floor, several boxes had been arranged in the form of a cross, and there was the heavy smell of gas and oil in the air, in that one spot. We pretty much gaped at each other for what seemed a few minutes. I looked at her and said, ""How many demons make the sign of the cross?"" and started putting boxes back on the shelf. That was the last I saw of her, she never came to work again.

 I decided it was time for George and I to have a heart to heart chat. In that respect, I felt the co-worker was right, he did need to cross over, at least be let known he could.

 I'd done a bit of research and had learned that the previous building owner had been named George. For privacy reasons I won't divulge his last name. Apparently he had been married to the gas station, and had been considered a class A mechanic. The station had been his life. From what I gathered he had died back in the bay doing what he loved, working on a car. 

 I waited until after closing one night, and stood in the bay, talking to him. I reassured him that he had done nothing wrong, that I knew he had been a good man, but his job was done. I asked him if there was something he needed to be done, or if I could in any way help him. He had shown me he could be a good friend, protecting me from the two legged beast called man, and I would miss him, but he was free to go, if he wanted to, it was ultimately his choice. ""But you really need to stop scaring my coworkers,"" I ended. 

 Things got quiet after that. The radio stayed tuned to whatever station you tuned in (except for rap). Boxes stayed where placed. Coworkers stopped mentioning weird stuff happening. But, when working alone, that country station would tune in and I'd feel that cob-webby sensation. I think George decided to hang around just a bit longer. Then one day, there was nothing. I believed he decided it was time to move on."
"Santa Barbara Trip","California","Misc","I worked in Santa Monica at a salon on Wilshire Blvd. While I was there a manager from a different location was getting married.

 The stylists from the salon wanted to go to their boss' wedding. The salon was in Santa Barbara, about 1 hour and 45 minutes away. The owner of both salons decided to put us up in a hotel and we agreed to work for the weekend so everyone could go to the wedding. My friend, Angela, went with me. We were very good friends, we knew each other about 10 years. We went to the same high school as well as the same beauty school. I knew her family and she knew mine. We also worked in the same salon. She is one of the most honest people I have ever met. 

 So off we go for the weekend. When we get to the hotel, we are told that there is only one queen size bed in our room. No big deal we would share the bed. First night we get to sleep after a long day at work. When I wake up in the morning Angela says to me, "" I have got to tell you something"", I say, ""ok"". She tells me to sit down and she is very serious.

 She tells me that she got up in the middle of the night around 3:00 am to go to the bathroom. While in the bathroom she decided to brush her teeth as well. She comes out of the bathroom and she says she saw me sitting up in bed and laying down at the same time. She then says, ""What are you doing?""

 She says I then turn my head to look at her and lay back down in my body and went back to sleep. She says it was kind of weird that she asked me, ""what are you doing?"". We kind of laughed about it. I didn't remember any of it. This was 25 years ago. To this day I don't have a clue what happened but I think about it a lot."
"A Ghost Ran Across The Road","New York","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I was at my job delivering pizzas on a Saturday night, I had just delivered a pizza and was on my way back to the restaurant. It was about 10:15 pm so it was dark. I had just passed the town's graveyard on the left, and it is a very large graveyard at that. I had never thought about it that much as there were no stories connected to it and I have walked through it a few times.

 I had just gotten to the end of it and there's a car in front of me, I see something move in the other car's tail lights, and this grey-white figure about 4 feet tall goes running across the road, I could see that it had arms and legs, definitely human shaped. Now this wasn't normal running either, it was running extremely fast and its arms and legs were moving in the same manner, so fast in fact, the arms and legs looked blurry. There is no way any human could move or run that fast. It ran up in between two houses, and when I slowed down to look where it went, it was pitch black between the houses with a bunch of small trees. I was thinking maybe something was blowing in the wind, but there was no wind that night, and there's no animals here in upstate NY that have arms like humans or would move like that.

 I had come to a stop to look in between the houses, and there were 3 people who were walking down the sidewalk that also were looking up there. Apparently they had seen it too and they said it ran no more that 25 feet in front of them and that they heard it's footsteps as well, so I wasn't the only one who saw it, and I swear a car coming the other way slowed down to look too. That experience sent chills down my spine. I've been trying to find stories similar to this to figure out what kind of entity it may have been to no avail."
"The Noon Time Knocking","Connecticut","Haunted Places","This is fairly standard, might be a tad cliche and I am sure people will come up with a handful of ideas of what this might be - but I'm nearly positive the house I live in is haunted. The house was built in the 50s, the kitchen has not been renovated or anything since then. There's three bedrooms, with the bedroom at the end of the hallway is at an odd angle. It is not a straight hallway. There's one full bath and then a half bath in the basement that was added on later. There's also a bar in the basement, and a fireplace. (There's a fireplace upstairs too.) The house is technically a single story, but we live on a hill, so our basement is partially ground level, and then our main floor is ground level. We rent the house from my Aunt's fiance, after we lost my childhood home to foreclosure. This house is my landlord's childhood home. It is probably important to note that my landlord's mother and father are both deceased. Also, all four of my grandparents are deceased.

So, with all that said, I'm going to explain the most recent crazy thing that has happened in this house. My bedroom is right next to the living room, it shares a wall, and my bed is against that wall. Every week day, when I am home, there is a knocking on the front door, which is also against the wall my bed is against. This has just started to happen in the past two weeks. I leave my room and check EVERY door (there's four doors to the outside) and I find absolutely no one. And it's always between 12:00 pm and 12:30 pm. Never at any other time. I'm sitting in the living room today, as I type this at 12:38 and there has been no knocking. I'm starting to think its someone trying to catch my attention or my mother's attention, (Although it has happened when I am home alone, so I am really thinking it's my attention.) 

I would say that an animal is a possibility, but how could they, every day, between 12:00 and 12:30, make a knocking noise in the same spot on the house? I don't think that makes too much sense. Thoughts?"
"Tall Stalker","Arkansas","Non Human Entities","A couple years ago I was living in a trailer where me and my two brothers shared a room. One night, I was asleep and began to have a nightmare of something I've never seen before. A tall (like 7ft or something like that) scrawny manlike thing was chasing me down a hallway on all fours while ripping its arm off and throwing it at me. It's face was plain with only large orange eyes and a slit for a mouth.

 I woke up panicked, feeling like I wasn't safe. I looked around the room and saw nothing at first and my brothers were still asleep. 

 Then I glanced at my doorway and saw the same creature thing staring at me. I looked it in the eyes and it seemed to be shocked that I could see it. It's eyes widened before it quickly moved out into the living room. I didn't know what to do, I just threw my blankets over my head hoping I was still dreaming but I knew I wasn't. I was scared shiatless. I can't remember my dream from after I fell asleep again but for the next few days I was a lot more on edge and alert.

 I want to know if anyone else has seen this thing or if anybody knows if it's got a name. I can't be the only one that's seen this. I hope not."
"Windows And Doors Opening","Illinois","Haunted Places","In the year 2013 we lived in a small quiet town of Roselle a town 25 miles outside of Chicago. At first when we moved in, we loved it. It was almost like a new chapter in our lives. Not long after we moved in things started to change. I was sitting in my dining room eating dinner, it was about 8:30 at night. As I'm sitting there I here a sudden bang on the patio door. I jerked my head up to see if anything was out there, I saw nothing. The next morning I asked my Mom about it, she told me not to worry about it.

I really just shrugged it off. A couple days went by with no activity, until one night. As I was closing the garage door I heard something slam, it sounded like it came from the 3rd floor. I quickly ran passed the foyer and I ran up the stairs and what I saw was unbelievable. The hall bathroom door was closed. I knew for a fact that door was opened because I left it open and nobody was home at the time.

 No window was open either so how could have that door closed on its own? It still baffles me today.

 Now the final occurrence, I leave the house with all the windows close. I come back approximately two hours later and when I walked through the door all the windows on the 1st floor were wide open!

 How could that be? Nobody was home, all the doors were locked and secured so nobody could have broken in. The 3rd strike was what broke the camel's back. I took it upon myself to do some research on my home. I do know that Roselle in itself is a very old historic town. 

I went online to do some research and I found some quite disturbing information. The land that my house sat on used to be a meat factory in the 50s and 60s I believe. There were a couple deaths at the meat factory and I connected the pieces with what odd occurrences I saw and heard.

 I said to myself my house has got to be haunted. When I gathered all the research and showed it to my Mom. She could not believe someone died on the property. Not soon after we found out why these occurrences were happening, we decided to sell the house and move elsewhere. That was our signal to leave and to never comeback. I have been occasionally checking the homes real estate status, the home has not sold and is still up for sale. 

No one has lived there since we left 5 years ago. Since then no further paranormal activity has occurred. At my new residence nothing out of the ordinary has happened. I wish that house wouldn't exist. It's just not a good place to be. I wish I never stepped foot in that house. At this time I live 30 miles from my former home, I don't plan on coming back to the area anytime soon."
"Unseen Entity Calling Out ""mom""","New York","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","It has been a few years since I last submitted a story to this website. However, in 2016, I had a personal experience that I feel is worth sharing. 

This incident occurred in the spring / summer of 2016 while I was on vacation from work, visiting my mother, my grandmother, my sister, and her boyfriend in New York. The group of us had been out to eat, and we headed back to my mother's apartment afterward. On the car ride home, my sister and her boyfriend had an argument, and after we arrived, he walked off to calm down and clear his head. My mother was upset that her boyfriend had walked off, and went to go find him. 

Now, picture this: My mother's apartment has a single staircase that leads up from the front door to the main floor of the apartment itself. After she left the apartment, my grandmother became worried and was standing at the top of the stairs looking down. I was standing next to her, maybe two feet away. My sister was with her baby in the living room, which was maybe only five total feet away from the top of the staircase. 

As we are all standing there, I distinctly heard what sounded like my mother's voice calling out, ""MOM!"" The voice sounded as if it was in distress. My grandmother heard it too, because when it happened, she looked at me with genuine fear in her eyes. I immediately sprinted down the stairs, and walked outside to see what was going on, thinking that something was happening. As I walked around outside the apartment, I saw that no one was there. My mother was no where in sight, and there was not one single person around. I found this very odd. 

A short time later, I found my mom probably about a quarter mile away down the road, having a conversation with my sister's boyfriend. Everything was fine, and the three of us went back to my mother's apartment. I asked her if she ever yelled out ""MOM!"" at any point in time when she left the apartment, and she told me she did not. 

I asked my sister if she had heard what myself and my grandmother both heard after we were all back at the apartment. My sister said she did not hear anything, yet she was standing literally one to two feet away from me when I heard the voice yelling. My grandmother confirmed what I had heard, and told me she was scared because when she heard it, she thought something was wrong. 

I was outside that apartment within seconds. There was no one there. Additionally, the voice sounded like it was coming from the bottom of the stairs, and not outside. There was no one at the bottom of the stairs at the time, since my mom had already left the apartment. To this day, I cannot rationally explain the voice yelling out ""MOM!"", or who did it. There was no television playing, and no radio playing at the time. This happened in the middle of the day as well. I think about that incident often, because it really kind of creeps me out to be honest! Any input is appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read my story."
"My Mom's First Paranormal Encounter","Nevada","Family / Friends Visits","At the time that this story first came in place, I was only a baby. So really, this story is from my mother's experience. 

Whenever I ask my mom if she's had any paranormal encounters, she always brings up this memory. Her first encounter was when my father was at work and it was just her and me in their bed in the middle of the day. Later in the day, she heard the kitchen cabinets downstairs open and close in a slow pattern. She would listen closely and then say, ""Hi, Grandma."" She explains that she never felt scared or threatened because she knew it was her. She knew because her grandmother was closest to her, and still was after death.

Sometimes, she would randomly wake up around 2-3 am after she felt a light rub on her chest like her grandmother was waking her up. 

Unfortunately yet, fortunately, as I got older and my mom had my younger brother, my mom stopped having any activity; which made me feel sad because I've been wanting to come upon a FRIENDLY spirit out of my dangerous curiosity. 

I tell my parents this all the time, and they tell me to never mess with spirits because I never know what I'm getting myself into. My mom -who somewhat believes in all things spiritual- tells me I should only communicate when you need them to leave you alone and to guide them to their own realm where they're supposed to be (they say you can help to guide them by fixing their regrets, take them to an upbeat and/or nostalgic place that almost forces them to move on into the spiritual realm, etc.)."
"Shadow Person Touched Me?","Massachusetts","Shadow People","I grew up in haunted houses and I've also been very sensitive to the paranormal, so it doesn't usually freak me out, but what happened last night, left me a bit confused and wondering if I should be alarmed.

I've seen/felt shadow people before in my room, always in my room, once in a while in the hall outside my room, but nowhere else in the house. Sometimes they wake me up, sometimes I just watch them for a while before I fall asleep. I usually see them moving slowly on the wall and ceiling on the opposite side of my bedroom, sometimes following the edge of the ceiling close to my bed. Lately, they've been getting aggressive. Moving faster, coming closer. 

My boyfriend is a trucker, so he wakes in the middle of the night to go to work, and then I go back to sleep. Nothing ever happens when he's in the room. Last night, he woke at 2, like usual, and was out the door for work. My 7 year old woke up, and joined me in bed, and we fell back asleep. About an hour later, I woke up and saw the shadows again, some on the wall/ceiling on the other side of my bed, a few on the ceiling line, and felt, more than saw, a pretty solid one behind me. I was facing the wall, with my son between me and the wall. The shadow behind me touched me on my side and pressed down, hard. It wasn't painful at that point, but it was very uncomfortable feeling, like I was being held down. I didn't move, because I was afraid if I did, it would stop focusing on me and focus on my son, and I didn't know what it was doing or why. My son did not wake up, but in his sleep, he was saying, ""no, no"" and moving closer to the wall, farther from me and the shadow. We stayed like that for maybe 10 minutes and the pressure of my side increased, so now, it still wasn't painful, but it was starting to feel sore, if that makes sense. By then, I was kind of irritated, so I mentally tried to shake it off. It reached it's ""hand"" to right in front of my face, about an inch away, and it felt like it was likely trying to pull something from me. It was definitely a solid feeling in front of my face, and at that point, the pressure on my side had become somewhat painful. At that point, I want from irritated to a little scared, so I mentally pushed it away, and it pretty much left, and then the shadows on the wall and ceiling dissipated.

What the Hell was that? Anyone have a similar experience?"
"Mambo","California","Haunted Items","Back in the mid-70's a buddy of mine bought some remote, high elevation acreage in Butte County, CA. It had been a Christmas tree farm at one time. One year he gave me permission to cut a tree on his property. It was getting dark and I came across a huge Douglas fir or pine tree stump that had a ceramic plaque attached to the base of it. My first thought was that the plaque commemorated the size of the tree or something along those lines. It was too dark to read it. Anyway, I pried it off and threw it in the back of my Jeep, thinking my buddy would probably like to have it. I took it home and placed it in a flower bed behind a retaining wall outside my kitchen. It was the night of Dec. 20th.

The next morning I heard water running in the bathroom. I went it there to find the water running in the sink and the bathtub. I certainly didn't turn it on and neither did my wife, and we're the only two in the house. I hear my wife yell from the kitchen. All four burners on the gas stove were blazing. My mom called later and I told her about the strange goings-on. She told me to go look at the plaque I brought home the night before.

It was a brown lacquered clay plaque, about 12""x8"", like something made in a home kiln. The inscription read:

 ""Agatha. A morning person and free spirit. Left this earth on Dec. 21."" Don't remember if there was a year.

Below that, across the very bottom it read ""Mambo"". From the bottom to the top, on each side, were two black King Cobras in an erect position with their tongues extended.

For a few years after that strange things like I described above would occur on Dec. 21. I still have the plaque. It's still out there in the flower bed. A fence has been built over it now. I thought about taking it back to where I found it, but quite frankly, I'd never find the spot again, and I don't want to touch it.

Things were calm for a few years. Then one rainy afternoon in late Dec. We heard the unmistakable sounds of someone creeping along in our attic, above the living room. The deal is, no one can walk upright in that section of the attic. We live in a wood-framed house that's over 100 years old in an old Gold Rush town, so strange creaks and groans aren't unusual, but this was definitely something walking very slowly above our heads.

The latest was my computer getting unplugged every two or three days. It's plugged into a power strip from above, in a tangle of wires... No way that sucker could could come unplugged by itself. But it did, time and again.

Never have felt threatened in any way, so we can live with whatever it is. That's my story."
"Where To Begin - The Mirror Came Back","Minnesota","Haunted Places","Its been a few years since I last posted on this site; but there have been some crazy developments within my household.

My siblings and I are planning on moving out of the house we shared with our lovely parents (yes, we are all adults; no, none of has children; yes we are planning on living together - I mean this economy is trash in this point in time). My baby sis and I were discussing our plans and it was just us at the house - me watching her play her video game and her playing, informing me of the new games coming out. We went back and forth from talking about her video games to her new room shes getting when we finally get into a new house. She said (something along these lines) 'I've wanted my own room since Mom kicked sis out of your bedroom and moved me in. I always loved the idea of having my own space...' and then all of a sudden the broom in the kitchen fell and made a loud 'smack' noise on the tile. We both jumped and looked at eachother like 'WTF JUST HAPPENED'. Since she's so brave, I sent her to go look at the kitchen (yes I'm the biggest scaredy cat ever - but sis can handle herself LOL) and see if anything broke. She walked in and all that was out of place was the broom. WEIRD

Like I said, we've been discussing our new path in life and planning on moving out of this house. If I had the money to keep it I would, but it's too expensive to fix up; 'its cheaper to buy a new house' said the contractor. Anyway, we've been slowly picking up the house - trying to get some of our parents stuff boxed up (it's more pictures of them and us growing up - scattered everywhere in the house). Well on one odd night, I was cleaning behind the TV where Mom put all her little nik naks over the years. There was this medium sized, porcelain, shell-shaped bowl (wow that's a lot of details LOL); Mom got it at a rummage and told us all 'one day, I'm taking you kids to the ocean; any ocean just so you can find a shell for me' and we laughed. I looked into it and I got a bit of goosebumps.

Why goosebumps? Well, let me give you a bit more details to this story.

Right before Mom passed, she went to Claire's (the cheap jewelry store - its fun jewelry and I always loved that store) and bought me this cute little mirror that has these lil jewels on them. Yea it was just a lil mirror but I loved it and Mom knew my taste was very cheap (LOL) so she got me it. I always looked in that mirror and even on the day she passed, I tried talking to her while she was in her coma and told her I had the mirror and she should wake up so I could brush her hair and she could look at herself in the mirror. She never woke up.

Anyway, back to the goosebumps. When Mom passed, I broke that mirror in half and gave her the backing of the mirror and I kept the jeweled side. I know it. I put it in her casket right next to her left elbow... Tucked it in so no one would see it and take it out (because we all have that one family member). Well guess what was in that bowl behind the TV? Yup you guessed right - the other half the mirror I gave to Mom. I asked my siblings and other relatives and no one has owned up to pulling out that mirror from her casket. WEIRD x2"
"Hooded Figure?","Missouri","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I was laying in bed one night after work. I am a single mother of twin girls. I hadn't fallen asleep just yet, but had my back to the door that led into my childrens' room, they were asleep when I last walked through the house before laying down. I was thinking about work the next day, when all of a sudden I felt someone crawling across my bed behind me.

 I thought at first it was one of my girls coming to join me to sleep in my bed. I felt this for a few more seconds then as it got closer to me I realized this felt a lot heavier than either of my girls it felt much larger against my back. At this point I was afraid and felt paralyzed like I could not move. I looked out of the corner of my eye over my shoulder and I saw what looked like a man in a hoody type thing setting over my shoulder. I was petrified I pulled the cover over my head and reached for the lamp and turned it on there was nothing there.

 I got up and walked around my house to make sure that no one was in fact in my home. Nothing, no one. The windows were all locked as well as all of the doors.

 I have asked several of my family members what this could have been and no one has an answer. I am in hopes that someone here can give me some insight on what this was or what it could have possibly wanted and why it came just that one time and I have never saw it again. I was not asleep at the time and I saw it very clearly. Was this thing there to hurt me? Was it there to scare me? Was it there to warn me of something? I would really like to know what this was all about."
"The Heritage Trigger & The Painting","Connecticut","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","First, I want to say I've spent the past week reading people's stories and I feel like I finally can be open and tell others about my experiences. This one is more intimate to me. I just want everyone to know that I always do everything I can to make sure that there is nothing naturally occurring to cause these things to happen.

So for starters, my grandmother knew absolutely nothing about her heritage, or my grandfather's heritage. So in an attempt to learn about it, my grandmother offered to pay for a few years to have me go on ancestry and start looking up family. My grandma's side of the family wasn't horribly hard to figure out, but I had to do a LOT of research on and off of ancestry to start to pull family members. My grandfather's side of the family has a connection to the Kelloggs. It was that side of the family that I had been struggling with, because what little information my grandmother knew, didn't give leads. So I got really deep into looking for my many great grandmother. I ended up finding out through a book written about a nearby town that the first name my grandmother had was actually her middle name.

Then I went to the cemetery, as I did with most of the family members that I found that lived nearby, and... I just could not find her head stone. Turned out, she didn't have a headstone. So then, I ended up starting on a HUGE endeavor to find the plot where she was buried, and put a marker there. (Granted, I still have not managed to find the plot. I can't even get a hold of the caretaker of the cemetery. Grrr.) 

The ghost part of this story occurred a few days after my mother, sister and I had gone to the cemetery to find her plot. I was laying in bed and woke up to a very, VERY vivid image of a young woman, see-through, at the end of my bed sitting next to my feet. She smiled at me and stood up, then was gone. It's not a super significant thing, because it was a quick over-and-done, but I got the sense that it was my many times great grandmother. She was dressed in 1800s clothing, which was the right era. (I'm a history buff.) 

I got the sense from the encounter, despite it being very brief, that it was her way of thanking me for caring about her. Her husband had remarried after she had passed away and never bothered to get her a headstone. I think that myself, my mom and my older sister are actually the first family members to put in an effort to actually find where she's buried and have a marker put in. I honestly felt at peace with her presence. I've had other paranormal experiences that left me shaken, but... This woman felt warm and I almost think she's my guardian angel now.

--

Now... I'm going to explain the painting. I paint. Being an artist is sort of my forte. For a good portion of 2016, I was living in my grandmother's house taking care of her while she battled ovarian cancer. I had painted her a picture of a tree with the cancer ribbon on it, and had the word Hope written in the ribbon. It wasn't/isn't a spectacular painting by any means, but I had made it specifically to put in her room to get her to know that there was hope. (My grandfather died in 2010. So she was already incredibly depressed.) 

My grandmother passed away in April 2017 due to complications from the chemotherapy. I lived in her house and took care of her animals and the property until close to October of 2017. At this point, the painting of the tree and ribbon was now hanging in her house over the small stairway from the ground floor to the second floor. 

For her funeral, my mom's cousins came up from Florida, as they were close to my grams. Two of the three cousins stayed in my grandmother's bedroom. (My grandmother passed at the hospital.) and my other cousin stayed in the guest/my room. I was sleeping on an air mattress in the living room. 

My family is a little different with grieving. We tend to reminisce and talk more about the fun and happy times and make jokes rather than dwell on what could cause us serious pain. My cousins and I were over at my brother's apartment, in the back yard around a huge bon fire just talking about my grandma and the things she used to do - we said something things that would probably have made her blushed, knowing we had spoken about it. She would have thrown the book at us for the things we were discussing and laughing about.

When my cousins and I got back to the house, we walked in and the painting I had done, was laying in the middle of the kitchen about 6+ feet from the staircase. I have to say, the cats could not have knocked it down, nor did it just fall rationally, because the nail I had hung it on was still firmly in the wall, at a steep angle. (In fact, a few months later, when we were cleaning the house out, I had to fight to get the nail out of the wall.) My cousins all told me goodnight and ran to their respective rooms, leaving me alone in the kitchen with the painting and no explanation of what happened. I hung it back up, and since then it never happened again. On this note, I'm fairly sure that was my grandma yelling at us for talking about her in a manner that was unbecoming. The painting is actually hanging on my bedroom wall now, and has not moved or fallen down even once since then. It was kind of comforting to me that my grandmother made it clear she could hear us and was yelling at us. Because the woman was a spitfire and it's good to know nothing changed after she passed.

These two stories were the most positive paranormal stories to happen to me. I will likely be posting again about some of the stranger/darker things that have happened to me. I just wanted to share these experiences with a community that could understand and give insight, if they wanted. Thanks so much!"
"Truly Haunted House","New Jersey","Haunted Places","I had just bought a new copy of Pink Floyd ""The Wall."" My friend and I were listening to it for the first time in my room. The room was about 8x10, with the stereo in the back of the room. The speakers were mounted on shelves in the back corner of the room. In the beginning of the album you hear an airplane in the distance, approaching getting increasingly louder and flying directly over head. At the point where the plane is directly over head and at the loudest, one of the speakers came off the shelf as if it was thrown and went across the room and out into the hallway maybe 12 feet or more. The stereo cut off and it got very quiet for a moment while we sat there trying to figure out what just happened. My friend jumped up and ran screaming out of the room, down the stairs and out the front door. He never came back to the house and I never did play the rest of that album. 

Over time several other things had happened in that house. Dinner plates being moved shortly after I had set the table. I even saw the figure of a tall man standing in the doorway of my room. He was wearing overall's, a white long sleeve shirt with the sleeves rolled up on his forearm. His left hand was on his hip and right arm extended out and resting on the door frame. He nodded his head a few times and slowly disappeared. 

The last time I was in that house was for the funeral of an old friend in 1998. I was asked to wear my sheriff's uniform for the funeral. At the time, there were 3 adults and one 2yo in the house. My mother was wheelchair bound and on the bottom level of the house. My wife and I were on the second floor. She was down the hall in the shower while I was in the bedroom shining shoes. I had used liquid edge dressing and put the shoes on a newspaper to dry then went down the hall to get a shower. My wife and I talked the whole time while I was in the shower so she didn't leave the room. When I was done, I went to get dressed and saw that my shoes were gone. I started yelling - at the house! Demanding that my shoes be returned. Since I couldn't find them I decided to wear sneakers and would stop at the uniform place along the way. We were planning to go back to our house after the funeral so I took our bags out to the car. I opened the trunk and nearly fell over as I had just found my shoes sitting there."
"Our Apartment Is A Paranormal Playground","North Carolina","Haunted Places","In the last month or so we have had so much activity in our house it's nuts, and I have no clue why! 

There has been no real changes in our house other than a couch was given to us by my mom and I know nothing is attached to it. 

But they are running rampant. 

First of there is a ghost, spirit however you want to say it that keeps messing with our bathroom door. 

Specifically every time that I am in there, it doesn't matter if I am in there long enough to put away towels, or to get a shower it shows up always sitting on the toilet seat or leaning on the counter just watching. I haven't seen it in full form only as a shadow but well enough to be able to tell if it's standing or sitting. 

I can walk by in the hallway and if the door is closed it will open almost every time.

Toys started going off by themself even if nobody is in the room and we turn them off, more common than not it's one of her books that tells stories or the walk behind lion that sings only when its moved. 

On top of that, things keep getting moved around the house like a lighter going from the kitchen bar to being found under our kitchen sink a week later. Certain clothes going missing to be found in the hall closet. 

Though the creepiest is candles will light by themselves and I asked my husband, Cuyler if he lit them and he said no. 

Shadows are constantly darting around our hallway and the living room. 

No matter what shields we use, how often we cleanse the house nothing seems to help! 

I don't know what I should really do, any advice?"
"Shadow Figure Running Away When Light Turned On","Idaho","Shadow People","A few nights ago, I had a scared feeling in my bedroom that made me feel like I needed to immediately turn on the bedside light. I frantically reached over and touched the lamp (touch light) and when the light came on, I saw a shadow figure streak across the bedroom from the bed, towards the treadmill, and disappear. The black streak looked almost comical - like one of those streaming figures, but all black.

When I saw it, I was happy that I'd scared it away. So I shut off the light, thinking smugly that I'd thwarted it's plans. However, almost immediately, I realized that he went 'into' the treadmill. I think I've commented on this before within the comment sections of my stories, but I have heard strange sounds coming out of the treadmill on occasion. The treadmill is unplugged, away from any heating/cooling vents, and nothing is stacked on it. However, I haven't heard anything from it in at least a couple of months. For some reason I suddenly made a connection between this shadow figure and the treadmill noise. So I said to myself that if I heard the treadmill make any noise I would know it was the shadow person doing it since it just went over to it. Within 3-5 seconds of thinking that, the treadmill made the noises, then stopped and has made no more noise since then. Coincidence? I don't believe so. It kind of irritated me, so I scolded the shadow person. However, as the realization hit me that he might just be over by the treadmill now, I was a bit scared and I ended up turning on the light to sleep by. 

The treadmill is a space saver type so that it is tall vertically when in the storage position, which it has been for a while (yep - good intentions...). I realized that it is tall enough that a black figure could hide behind it. So the next morning I looked it over really well. Behind it, on all sides. Played with the power cord. I jiggled it. I could make it slightly make the noise that it had made the night before by jiggling it really hard by pushing and pulling on it. I couldn't make it make any creaking sounds without a significant effort.

The day after my shadow man sighting, my husband seemed like something was really wrong. He was quiet, and his facial expressions were very sad. I asked him what was wrong and he said he was just having a bad day and would prefer to be left alone. This was completely out of the blue - he'd been in a great mood for quite some time. This solidifies my feelings that the shadow folk are associated with negativity. Keep in mind, it's not just this one isolated incident, but the combined set of experiences with shadow people that seem to be associated with negativity. In any case, my husband was back to his normal self the next day.

I'm curious if anyone else has seen the shadow figure running away, and looking like a streak of black?

Also, has anyone else heard the shadow figure interact with solid objects?"
"Shadow Woman/spiderman","South Carolina","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","One night I was coming home from a party at around 2am. As I was walking through the yard, I saw a shadow of a woman with long hair in my mom-in-law's bedroom window. I thought it was her so I didn't think anything of it at first. 

The next morning I walked into her room to ask if she waited up for me to come home the night before. She told me she was asleep before 12. Then she asked me if I walked into her room when I got in because someone stood at the end of the bed saying ""Mama"". I don't know if that was a sign for us, but we were already planning to move out of that house weeks before. 

Another experience I've had happened a couple weeks after the first incident. I was babysitting a two year old and a six month old. Like any two year old boy entering his terrible twos, Sam would run around the house screaming ""I'm Spiderman"" at the top of his lungs. I didn't think anything of it until he stood in front of a wall yelling ""Noooo, I'm Spiderman! You Batman"". Nobody was there. But that wasn't the worse part. What really creeped me out was when his six month old sister (who was in my arms at the time) stopped smiling at me and looked straight past me at the wall with her eyes wide as I had ever seen. Suddenly she started to scream and I couldn't get her to stop or to look at me. Sam began to scream ""I'm Spiderman!"" over and over again at the wall. Finally the baby stopped screaming abruptly and so did Sam. 

Shortly after I heard the screen door slam and when I went to open the front door to see who or what it was, no one was there."
"Demonic Bird","South Carolina","Pets / Animals","During my freshman year of college in an all girl dorm, roommate and I lived in an interior room meaning there were no windows- so we kept a faint night light so we didn't kill ourselves if we went to the bathroom at night. Our beds were lofted with the desks underneath- we were high enough up that you'd hit your head on the ceiling if you weren't careful. Our room was shaped like an L, I was on the wall parallel our door and my roommate was opposite of me in the L section.

One night, I was sick with a cold and sleeping on my back due to being unable to breath out of my nose (it was a normal cold nothing serious just stuffy nose and sore throat. No fever.) I woke up in the middle of the night with a strange feeling. I exhaled and found it strange that I could see my breath. I exhaled again to see if I was really seeing my breath or not and I was. As my mind started to come out of the fog of sleep, I realized one of my legs was uncovered and I could feel the heat blowing on it and it was definitely not cold enough to see your breath inside! Then the sense of dread came. I had an overwhelming feeling to look at my door. I slowly turned my head on it's side and saw a strange object in the corner of my room. I had a chair in the corner by the door. At first, I thought it was just the chair. But the longer I looked at it, I realized that my bed was too high up to see the chair while laying flat on my back, which meant something was pearched on top of it. I had a bad sense- like something bad was happening or that someone wanted to hurt me. Confused and scared, I sat up and tried to try to discern what it was. As soon as I sat completely upright, it shot off the top of my chair and opened itself up (it unfolded its wings from its sides) at the foot of my roommates bed. It was a huge black bird with huge plumed wings. The wingspan was probably 3ft. As soon as it had opened, it promptly flew into the mirror on the wall beside it and disappeared. I ripped my covers off and started screaming my roommate's name. I thought I had died in my sleep and the bird of death came to take me away. I never did get back to sleep that night. Thankfully, I never saw the bird again afterwards.

I'm not saying this is related but after this occurred my health took a bad turn for the worse. I recovered from my cold (it was just a head cold) but I developed a serious case of pneumonia that landed me in the hospital roughly a month later. Even after recieving antibiotics, it took me about three months before I fully recovered my strength...

Has anyone else seen anything similar? Am I just crazy? I feel this was not sleep paralysis as I was able to move and I've never had sleep paralysis before. I am also sure I was completely conscious. I also want to make a point that this bird was 3D- like an actual giant bird. I could make out the feathers on it."
"Spirit In My Bedroom? Somebody Help Me?","California","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I'll make this as short as possible. 

The signs: 

* Whenever I go to sleep I feel that something is poking me? Poking my whole body? It's very softly. Something also touches my hair too. This has been happening for maybe 2 years. I get really scared sometimes so I go sleep in the living room sometimes and I still feel the pokes. One time I couldn't sleep cause of the poking, and then I had a dream of a white figure-less things grabbing my hand saying 'come with me'... Hey say that sometimes the things you see in your dreams are the spirits that are around you, watching you. What if this is the spirit that is poking me? 

* whenever I head into another room because of the poking, I feel like this thing follows me? I'm in pitch darkness with the cover over me, but around the room I can feel an energy moving around and coming closer to me. I feel when it's coming closer because my stomach gets all tingly. The stronger it gets, the more my stomach goes in. 

* not only does it poke me, but I feel an energy gets close to my skin around my ankles legs and knees and then my legs starts shaking and vibrates. Also I feel something very warm touching my skin.

* I feel something sit on my bed and move slowly towards me. It just stays behind me. This only happens at night when I'm ready to sleep. I could feel it coming. I had a dream that something was coming behind me in my bed and it felt so real and then I woke up. I feel like it's getting stronger.

* I see blue circles, I think I saw a white mist, I see shadows from the corner of my eye in my closet, I hear voices in my head when my mind is relaxed and going to sleep. It calls my name. I heard a voice of a young man speaking when I was kind of conscious but kind of sleeping too. I got an image of somebody's lips? One time I was between conscious/unconscious and my whole body was pulsating upwards like a spasm. I woke up and I remembered it. 

* the last thing is, I know I'm not crazy. I know that something really is happening to me because one day at like 5 am, I was waking up but my eyes were still closed and I heard a loud deep voice in my room and I woke up screaming. My sister told me she was already awake, and that she heard it too. She sleeps in the next room really close to mine. She said it was a creepy voice talking, it sounded like an old man. I know for sure it was a man because the voice was really deep, almost zipper-like. My cat came in the room and was just staring at something in my closet. My cat wasn't scared or anything. That is what confuses me? My cat was just calm. If it was something bad, wouldn't it have hissed or something? So 2 people heard this voice. That means that it isn't in my head.

Can a psychic help me or give me their email to find out who is the spirit in my room? Or can somebody tell me what they think it is? Thanks:)"
"The Irish Brigade","Arizona","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I was put in mind of this experience and provoked to write it down to share by Spockie's experience ""Band of Runners"". 

I was 8 or 9 years old at the time and was visiting the Grand Canyon area with my father and brother. We were staying in an old 3 story walk-up motel (the kind that is only one room deep with no internal staircases - all rooms being reached via an open gallery that runs along the frontage of each level). I don't think the aging facility was even equipped with air conditioning as every night during our stay (much to my chagrin and trepidation) we slept with the big sliding window wide open - my cot slid right up against it. 

I couldn't sleep a WINK the first two nights because of the howling of the coyotes. I had never before heard anything even remotely like it and to my young ears it was dreadfully eerie and menacing. I just KNEW that at ANY moment a huge, frothing, snarling, blood thirsty coyote was going to come bursting through the tattered screen and eat me up! 

As bedtime on the last night approached, I deeply hoped that exhaustion would win out and I would miss the evening's wretched serenade. Soon after the lights went out, my father and brother were sound asleep and I could hear their light snoring. I lay in my bed wide awake and scared stiff waiting for the ghastly howling to begin. 

Gradually, however, the oddest thing happened - I felt the strangest calm wash over me like a cool breeze. That's when I heard the distant voices. I was never a kid to wander off on my own but for some unaccountable reason, I got up from my bed, unlocked the door and stepped out onto the gallery (our room was on the 3rd floor). The voices -for I could tell there were a great many of them- were singing! 

Best of all to my delighted though bewildered young mind was that I recognized the song! It was Colonel Bogie's March - though I knew it as the tune the campers were whistling in 'The Parent Trap'. And I had never known the song had lyrics. I could only make out bits and pieces then but recently I looked up the song after it came up over a dinner conversation and this is what I found:

"" (tune:""The Colonel Bogie March,"" written for ANZACS (""Australia New Zealand Army Corps"") in World War I, was popularized by being featured in the 1960s film about WWII in Burma, ""The Bridge on the River Kwai,"" from the novel by Pierre Boule.)

So get Arrid, and get marrid,today!"" (https://www.disboards.com/threads/help-me-with-a-song.691542/) 

The moment I read those words, I knew it was what I had heard - the memory is still clear as crystal in my mind. I remember too they all sang with a distinct Irish brogue.

They were the merriest bunch I had ever seen as they seemed to materialize into view along the dark gravel road. Dozens of them there were - all marching along in loose formation lustily singing out at the top of their lungs.

And as they passed the building they simply faded away. I could hear their singing for a few minutes after they had gone. I went back inside and dropped off to sleep. The coyotes were quiet that night.

For some time I simply assumed the band to have been as mortal as you or I. But as time has passed, I have put more thought into it. 

First of all, where the devil might they have come from? I distinctly recall how remote and isolated that aging motel was. Several times on the approach, I had thought my father to be hopelessly lost as we had driven for so long without seeing any sign of civilization - at least 20 minutes at a rate of no less than 50mph. 

Second, why was I the only one on the gallery? Neither my father nor brother seemed to have heard a thing - they certainly weren't awakened by all the sound. And I heard no angry voices from any of the other rooms even though I worried I might as there were other open windows and ours was one of several cars in the lot - though not nearly enough to have held as many people as I had seen in the march. 

Third, I could hear their voices but not the sound of what should have been dozens of crunching feet on the dry gravel road. 

Fourth, that song had not been popular for decades. The tune may pop up here and there on the rare occasion but I have never heard the words sung anywhere else.

Last, they truly seemed to vanish rather than fade into the dark as a flesh and blood figure does. 

What were they? Flesh or phantom? I truly do not know but whatever they were, they were good and merry souls who brought a world of comfort and rest to a very stressed little girl that night."
"Seeing A Ghost For The First Time","New Jersey","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I remember this very vividly because until this day it sends chills down my spine. You see, my childhood home was very haunted but I didn't become aware of this until I turned 9 and in the 3rd grade.

 In order to explain what happened clearly, I have to let you know how the house was set up and what happened prior before I saw *him*. My childhood home was a two family house, my family lived on the first floor and the landlord lived on the second floor. It was like two separate apartments in one house sort of thing.

 The landlord was an older man and he was very nice to my family, truly the best landlord ever and he was originally from Spain. Why I mention this you may ask? Well because when I saw *him*, I was completely alone at home. Our landlord was in Spain, my father didn't get out until 7:30pm from work, and my mom stepped out to the store. Initially, this didn't worry me at all because my mother left my brother in charge since he was 18 years old.

 So there I am in my room, playing my GameCube system, (Sonic Heroes to be exact), just being a regular kid. Then my brother comes into my room and asks me if I'm okay with being alone at home because he wanted to go to his friend's house. I was in fact comfortable being alone at home because I knew not to answer the door if someone came knocking and if anything happens, to lock myself in the room, hide under the bed and call 911. So I told him ""yeah sure"", and he was gone. This was my error. Well my brother's error if we're being technical since he was left in charge.

 As I'm sitting there moments after my brother left, I begin to hear the doorknob to my room start shaking. My brother closed the door before he exited, so I assumed it was him and he hadn't in fact left yet. The doorknob continued to twist and make the noise it does when someone is about to turn it and come inside, so I became irritated and shouted ""Just come in! What is it?"". I paused the game and looked to the door. It did not open, my brother didn't answer, and I was irritated thinking my brother was trying to bother me. So I get up, swing my door open, and to my surprise I find no one there. That's when I kind of got scared, but to prevent the fear getting to me, I began to think rationally. Maybe it was just a truck driving by that shook the door a bit, maybe it was my imagination? So I shrug it off and go back to my video game, but I was scared if it happened again so I decide to save the level I was on and turn the system off.

 To distract my mind I decided it was best if I left my room and finish my homework that I started while in class. Yes I was one of those kids. So I walk into my living room to fetch my backpack I left on the couch earlier when I got home. While I'm in there looking through my bag and pulling out my folder and notebook, I hear what it sounded like two people arguing. I stop what I'm doing and instantly become intrigued. I listen and it sounded like it was coming from upstairs, two distinct voices, a man and a woman, but I couldn't quite make out what they're saying. Then I go from being intrigued to instantly terrified because it dawned on me, THE LANDLORD WAS IN SPAIN! So who the hell was arguing upstairs?! When I realized this, the voices stopped, and no I am not a schizophrenic, and no, no one else lived in the building besides my family and the landlord. I thought I should call 911, so I go over to the house phone which was on the other end of the living room, and let me tell you, what happens next truly changed me and shook me to my core. The kitchen is right next to my living room, and next to the kitchen was my brother's room. From the doorway of the living room you can see the kitchen, and where I was standing I could see straight through. I heard footsteps coming from my brother's room and I froze, phone in my hand. What happened next must've been just a couple of seconds but it felt like minutes, because when I looked up to the doorway, I SEE AN OLDER MAN JUST WALK ACROSS, COMING FROM MY BROTHER'S ROOM, PASSING THE DOORWAY AND MY LINE OF VISION, AND JUST WALKED ACROSS! I literally began to cry in fear and I run out the front door to my front yard. I didn't know what to do, but I know I saw a ""man"" clear as day. This ""man"" had on a plaid shirt, old face, and sort of bald with white hair. I don't recall the bottom half of him but he walked across as if he were taking a stroll in the park. This happened in about 2 seconds, maybe 3? But I was so scared it felt like I stood there for minutes before my fight or flight instincts kicked in, and I took off. 

 So there I was now, outside in my front yard, standing by the gate because I know I'm not allowed to leave by myself, AND I was crying. I didn't know what to do and I was praying someone from my family would come home. Then I saw this stranger walk by and he looked at me giving me a ""what the hell?"" sort of face as he walked by. I mean I was 9 years old, it was like around 6pm at night, and I'm crying by the gate like a weirdo. I didn't blame him for looking at me strange. 

 After calming myself down a bit I remember my mom saying that it's the living we should be afraid of, not the dead. That's when I knew I saw a ghost. Everything made sense, but honestly what could a ghost do to me? So after crying and gathering my inner guts together, I walk back inside my house, cautiously. I close the front door and I pick up the phone from the ground. Should I call 911? What am I going to say? That I saw a ghost? What can the cops do about that? But thankfully, my prayer was answered and before I knew it, my mother came through the front door. As soon as we locked eyes I began bawling once again.

 My mother, terrified, dropped her grocery bags and asked me what was wrong. I tried speaking through those weird crying gasps I used to do as a kid, and told my mom everything that happened. She walked me to the kitchen, and of course, nothing was there. She sat me on the counter and grabbed a paper towel wetting it to wipe away my tears and boogers that came dripping down. My mother being the religious woman that she is, decided she was going to bless the house and my brother's room specifically since I told her the old man I saw came from his room. 

My brother then walks in 15 minutes after and boy did he hear it. My mom scolded him so bad for leaving me alone at home, but he was more concerned with me because I was still crying sitting on the kitchen counter. My mom explained to him what happened and he was shocked. He didn't know what to say. Gladly, they both believed me, and it wasn't until later on I found out why. 

 Months after when that incident occurred, my mother then tells me that who I saw was the old landlord who previously owned the house before the Spanish one. She knew it was him because apparently our current landlord has seen him around a few times before and told my parents about it. The reason why he appears is because he used to do some black magic or was intrigued with the black arts sort of stuff. Then he passed away, haunting our house which I guess he never really left really after dying.

 Luckily, I never saw him after that night, but ever since that night I became fascinated with ghosts and the supernatural. I love horror movies now and nothing has ever scared me like when I saw that ghost. Nothing compares to that fear I felt that night and hopefully I'll never feel that terror again."
"It Watches","California","Haunted Places","I have had multiple experiences with the paranormal before my mother died. However once she died and it seemed the activity picked up with the darker entity that I call the black figure.

 My first memory that I can remember of the figure is when I was about 4 or 5 (back when my mother was alive). It would always be me, my brother and my mother who was always in between us and I would sleep on the left side of the bed nearest to the closet and the door. Well my mother had a headboard that had 3 mirrors on it in a row and the mirror above me allowed me to see directly out the door and into the hallway, the hallway light was on just about every night because I was terrified of the dark like most kids are. 

I have a hard time sleeping even as a child and while I waited for sleep to take me I would rollover on to my stomach and some way or another something would always draw my eyes to the mirror above me. There would always be this black figure standing in the doorway staring at all 3 of us, and at first I thought it was my grandfather because my grandfather had his bedroom right across from us but it never struck me as odd that he stayed there staring at us. 

My grandfather was a mean man back then so my first instinct was to always close my eyes and wait for him to walk away, and I would always fell asleep before I could have the chance to hear him walk away. As time passed I had more and more trouble sleeping and the more trouble sleeping the more I would see the black figure in the doorway and eventually I got so used to seeing the black figure there that every time I saw it in the mirror I would get more and more detail of it but it remained a solid black so I couldn't get any features from it. But I started noticing that it never left the doorway the entire time I was awake and the next morning my first thought (never failed) was ""Did I dream that or was it really there"". Which takes me forward 7 years (12 years old now) to where I've already had my fair share of experiences and a bad habit of staying up all night and binge watching shows. 

One night I was laying on the couch watching some show on tv and I just get this overwhelming feeling of paranoia or anxiousness but I figured I was just sleep deprived (it had been awhile since I slept) so I just wormed my way deeper in to the cushions and pulled my blanket higher as I turned to my side. When I did that I was able to see the sliding glass doors and into the pitch black backyard and the only light was coming from the tv which was bright enough illuminate part of the kitchen. Maybe 10-15 seconds after I had turned to my side I saw a black figure walk across the kitchen and it blocked out the light that was hitting the sliding glass doors. I watched it disappear into the island and before I could let it fully register I told myself ""Nope, shut up"" and I turned to my other side and drew the blanket above my head only leaving a tiny hole for air. When I told my mom about this she was obviously worried about it but didn't want to scare me so she tried to brush it off and tell me I was imagining things. 

A year later when I was about to start freshman year my dad's dad died, then a week later my mother died. Everything went downhill fast and it felt like the energy in the house just became stronger and overwhelming. I feel it resides in my mother's/my old bedroom. I have more experiences with it once I moved out but once I completely cut myself out of my fathers life I have yet to see or feel anything related to that energy (well actually once but it had nothing to do with the dark figure... I hope). My father is a terrible man who has done awful things so it's no surprise evil follows him and his offspring."
"The Discord Spirit","Ohio","Haunted Places","Krom once again, and it's been awhile since I've needed to come on here for answers (previous comments were very helpful with my last submission like a year ago so thank you to everyone who had helpful information). As previous readers will remember, my wife had recently been bequeathed an old antique chair which sits in our living room, well it still sits in the living room, but the activity has stopped from it completely (I assume what I'm about to talk about has nothing to do with that as it is COMPLETELY different in nature). So once again thank you for all your comments concerning it.

Now onto what I'm about to talk about. I'm not sure how to get into this so I'll just jump right in. Next to our living room is my computer room I use for both work and gaming at night with my cousin who lives in Grenada (his fiancé is in medical school down there), and in this room is also my dog Hannah's kennel as she likes to lay inside behind me while I'm playing at night before bed.

 Recently, my computer had been having issues with overheating, which I had believed was an electrical problem as the light in the room kept blowing light bulbs (like 6 bulbs in the span of 2 weeks). This would always occur while I was at work and I'd come home to the light being out, and Hannah would be going full on crazy. In fact I could hear her barking and howling while turning down my street. But when I would come inside she would stop, and I just figured it was her anxiety or something of that nature.

 Onto the computer, recently it had been having overheating problems, and would just CONSTANTLY shut down after a few minutes of being on. Well I had found out the problem and replaced the fan over the CPU and everything worked fine. But then other weird stuff started to begin happening. One night while gaming with a crew of people in Discord (voice connect app for those that don't know), we were all playing and my mic started having a meltdown. Weird noises and screams were coming from MY mic and my friends thought I was playing a weird prank on them. It was like static white noise and screaming and it scared me to death. We attributed it to a random glitch and moved on after it stopped.

2 weeks later the same thing happened again, but before it started up, my dog started barking behind me and just as I turned to shush her as the family was sleeping, my headset started blaring and screaming again. It sounded like a woman screaming at the top of her lungs inches from my ears. I threw the headset off and yanked the usb cord out of my PC tower and even without it being plugged in, the scream was STILL coming from my headset, and I yelled a few choice terrified words and ran upstairs to wake up my wife and had her come downstairs. You could still hear the headset while coming down the steps, that's how loud it was and just as we walked to the door to the computer room, it stopped and the light blew out in the room with a small popping sound (I guess like a single kernel of corn popping?).

Well I stopped gaming for a few days after that, and my wife doesn't seem too concerned, as she thinks a spirit was just ""passing through"", but I don't think that. There was enough of a space between the first and second instance that it doesn't seem like an ""oh hi, just passing through screaming bloody murder"" type thing.

 I've also noticed the house next to ours has felt slightly weird (my computer room is the closest to the next house over), it is abandoned but the owner won't sell it. I offered to buy it because it's boarded up for the most part but cats infest the area because of it, just so I can knock it down and claim the land for a larger yard, but he wants an insane amount for it ($10,000 more than what we paid for our house, guy is crazy I think). I'm not sure if the spirit is there, because it doesn't feel like a spirit is actually IN my house, but just nearby. 

Who knows for sure, but I wanted peoples' opinions on this whole electronic phenomenon. It's something I've never dealt with before, as ghosts and spirits usually just manifest and I actually see or hear them. Also, I'm almost 100% sure the spirit is not ""physically"" in my house, at least it doesn't feel that way. Is there a ""range"" or whatever a spirit can affect electronics? Also if the spirit is not in my house, how do I prevent this from happening again, because random 110 decibels is very jarring to say the least. Anything helpful would be appreciated.

Lastly, the date of this writing is 5/23/18, and when/if this gets posted, I will post any other occurrences that happen in the time between in the comments."
"The Rising Star, Indians Drums, And Singing","Missouri","Haunted Places","I have 2 experiences I want to share that I personally feel tie into each other and that recently I can't get off my mind. The first is a UFO that I feel is linked to the Native drumming and singing. After I tell the story I want to go into some background of the life on the farm because after reading some other stories of the same native drumming and singing I feel there is a lot in common besides the out of the normal experience others and my self have had. 

As a kid I spent every summer on my grandparents old farm, which is now called Crane Kettle Farms near Stockton Missouri.

One evening as the sun was getting close to the horizon my grandfather, brother, and my self were sitting on the front porch looking out over the farm when beyond the tree line we watched what looked like a star rise up, stop, and then shoot off like a shooting star. We all looked at each other in disbelief. I'm not sure how old I was. I would say from 10 to 12 years old.

The second experience I had took place after the sighting and not sure how many years after, but I know it was after. It was about the same time as the ufo sighting. My brother, cousin, and I were just getting done putting up the chickens, ducks, and geese when we were walking back to the house and started to very faintly hear native drumming and singing. We could see a good ways around us especially in the direction the sound seemed to be coming from. When the sound got closer and closer and louder and louder very quickly. It was right up on us and yet we saw nothing. It seemed like what you would expect if anybody thought of native singing and drumming. I saw my grandmother come out the house on the front porch and I took off running. When I looked back I saw my brother shaking my cousin which had turned completely white and scared stiff.

I have recently looked up the indian tribes in the area and see that it is or was Osage territory so I looked into their beliefs and try to find out about some of their folk lore and came across some stuff I found interesting. 

The Osage believe that the star people came down to guide the people of earth from their bad ways. Which makes me think about the star that rose from the tree line and shot off. It makes me feel like maybe there is some truth to that because I know what I saw. 

I also came across a story recently about drummers. I forget the story so I'm going to paraphrase like no other. Basically there came a point when the youth were pretty much becoming sissy horn dogs and making fun of the old ways of hard work being a man of courage and so forth. The young ones would drum when when the older ones would drum and make fun of everything the older ones did. Lol kind of like youth today. What I also read is you had to earn your way into the spirit world or when you die your spirit will roam earth. I recently thought maybe the drumming is the spirits of these younger ones that made fun of the ways of the tribe and didn't earn the way into the spirit world. Just a thought. I now know others in different states have experienced the same thing so I'm not sure I can say it retains to the Osage. But many tribes had very similar stories and beliefs.

About the farm and my time up there.

The farm was really kind of in the middle of nowhere. It was always mostly just me and my brother. No other kids, but sometimes other cousins might hang out for a few days and then we didn't see them until next summer. It was close to about 80 acres with cows and chickens and what not that I mentioned earlier. I spent many days roaming the farm by myself hanging out and even sleeping with the cows. There was one I could lay against and she wouldn't get up until I got up. Playing with frogs and fishing in the pond finding clams or oysters in the creeks, catching crawdads, just running around be a curious a boy trying to entertain himself anyway I could find. I can remember being as young as 8 or 9 doing this all by myself. 

My mom use to tell us as the sun sets or at night she could hear the drumming and singing sometimes. I didn't believe her but now I know she was not making it up.

Well that's about it. I would really like to hear from others rather its the same type of experience or just your own opinion or insight."
"Astral Projection And Mom's Message","New York","Family / Friends Visits","First, a big thank you to Miracles for the help and encouragement regarding sharing this experience. This isn't a typical ghost story, but I hope you'll find it interesting regardless...

A little background; I started astral projecting almost 5 years ago. The first time it happened was completely spontaneous (as were the following 2-3 times after this). Definitely mind blowing stuff. I remember the first time it happened, I thought ""Oh my God, it's real! This is amazing!"". I don't know why, but I knew exactly what was happening while it happened. I had no fear. I had previously thought that out of body/astral projection experiences were not real and bogus stories. Boy, was I (thankfully) wrong. Since then, I've gotten a tiny bit better at control and initiation. However, I am not an expert by any means and wish I could initiate it more frequently. Many of my experiences have been short and sometimes hazy (difficulty with vision). However, I have had some beautiful, very clear and personal experiences that have further cemented my belief in the existence of life after death. 

This experience took place 2 years ago, in 2016. I intentionally went out of body and immediately entered what I would describe as some type of warehouse. I walked down a hall to investigate, turned a corner and saw my mother standing there. My mother passed away almost 17 years ago (in November). I've encountered her a few times while ""out"" and our interactions are usually brief with lots of hugs and her reassurances that she is with me and loves me (I am very lucky). 

This time, I immediately asked her if the voice I had heard (it sounded like grumbling) while exiting my body was George (George is what we nicknamed the spirit/ghost in the house I grew up in. I have mentioned him in previous stories on this site). I don't know why I asked that. After I had asked if it was George, she made this ""Mmmmmmm"" sound as if she debated on telling me. I asked again and she said ""Listen, pay attention. You need to remember 50 10"". I asked what that meant. She replied, ""Just remember, 50 10. Pay attention. Something will happen next week and you will know what it means"". That was it. I was back in my body, awake, trying to figure out what that meant. It nagged at me, so I called my father and explained everything. He does believe me as far as my AP experiences, but has a hard time understanding it. I don't blame him.:) 

He wondered if maybe, it had to do with the date of May 10th (50= May, 5th month, after taking away the 0 and 10 as in the 10th day). I do understand the confusion as far as 50 equaling May, but can't explain why it was related this way. This took place on May 5th or 6th. I thought, maybe, but it seemed too easy, right? So after brainstorming on it for awhile, I figured when the time came, I would know what 50 10 meant.

Fast forward a few days later. My cousin, who I'm very close to (we are 4 months apart) called uncontrollably crying, trying to speak. Finally, I understand her. She was saying ""He's gone! He's gone! My brother is gone, he's dead!"" For privacy reasons, I will call him Ray. Obviously I was shocked; her brother was 31 years old, his death was sudden and a total surprise. I jumped in the car to go to her house and be with her. While driving, it hit me: The date was May 10th. I called my father to deliver the sad news and to start rallying the family together. Then I said ""Dad, it's May 10th"". He said ""Oh my God. It is! It was true!"" To this day, I'm still flabbergasted over this. It's hard to imagine my mother giving me a piece of information this serious. One more thing that happened just prior to her phone call; my left ear started ringing (very loud and high pitched). I remember I stopped what I was doing and felt uneasy. I don't know if it's connected, but thought it worth mentioning. 

The only thing I could and can think of is that I was given a sort of ""heads up"" message regarding Ray's death. I know it seems too crazy to be true. My reasoning is this: Our family was not meant to intervene, but to understand that family on the other side was expecting him and for some reason it was meant to be. That thought has comforted me since it happened and gave me the strength to help with the arrangements and support his siblings and father (Ray's mother, my mother's sister, also passed away, about 6 years ago). 

I can tell you, this incident was very clear. No haziness, trouble seeing or hearing. Any input, thoughts or similar experiences are appreciated. Thank you so much!"
"The New Condo - Pt. 2","Oregon","Haunted Places","**This is part two of a recount of my family's experiences over a few years in a condo we lived in - for background see part 1.**

As time went on, the feelings of being watched turned into being followed around the house very closely - like the person was right behind me, almost stepping on my heels as I walked. It felt child-like in size, only 3-4 feet high. 

Whatever was following me didn't feel angry or threatening. But it had a very intense energy, like when someone is intent on you - and only you.

When the feeling of being followed would get too much, I would tell it in my mind very strongly to back off. It would but in a day or two it would be back. 

Whenever I felt a presence in that condo, it was always started with the air changing, like a heaviness or thickness would set in. The air somehow had substance, an energy all its own. 

Then my body would react - the hairs on my arms or neck would prickle, like when you get goosebumps - or my left forearm would ache (a sensation I would feel again later in life - but more on that in other stories).

One night, I was laying in bed and still awake, trying to fall asleep even though I never felt comfortable in that room. 

I started to feel a weight next to me in the bed and began to hear breathing. Thinking it was just my own, I held my breath and waited. Sure enough, the breathing continued beside me. We didn't have the central air on, no fan in the room, or any pets - I couldn't rule out what I was hearing. 

Most of the activity in the condo happened to me, but this next incident took away any doubt for my parents.

My parents said up late one night and were sitting in the kitchen talking. I had gone to sleep hours before.

All of a sudden they heard frantic running upstairs, from one end of the condo to the other, multiple times. My dad described it as very heavy feet pounding on the floor, as if someone were running as fast as they could. 

Thinking that it was me, my parents raced upstairs, only to find me sound asleep in my bed. None of my blankets were disturbed, and I wasn't breathing heavily (like someone would if they had been running that way). 

I've never been a sleep walker, before this incident or after. I'm a heavy sleeper and don't move about or get up in the middle of the night (especially in that house). So my parents had no explanation even though they heard it straight above their heads, clear as day.

As parents recounted this story to me the next morning, I knew it had gotten to them, they both looked so startled. I'd never seen my parents look like that before.

This incident seemed to signal a change in the activity in our home, from here things seem to escalate. 

I was laying in my parent's bed and watching a movie since they had a bigger TV in their room. Dad was fixing the sink in the bathroom, Mom was working late. 

After a while, my eyes were drawn away from the TV to the entrance of my parent's bedroom. I felt like I was being watched, but it wasn't a child or the man from before, it felt like a woman and she was troubled, almost sad. 

The sadness grew more and more intense until it seemed to wash over me. Out of no where I began to cry until I was weeping. For some reason, I was so sad for her, I couldn't stop crying. It was also like she was showing me how she felt or a recording of a moment in her life - I wasn't sure. 

Dad came in when he heard my crying getting louder, but him coming in seemed to chase her away. My dad always had a very strong / intense personality, nothing bothered me when he was around.

As we entered the third year in the condo, more incidents happened during the day.

It was the middle of the afternoon and I decided to spend some time in our living room. It was the one place in the house that always seemed calm to me.

The living room was very simple. There was a large gray leather recliner by the windows, a TV on the other wall, and another chair on the same side of the room as the recliner. 

Choosing the leather recliner, I put up the foot rest and leaned back. When you put up the foot rest of the recliner, your feet are in line with the bottom of the TV. 

It was a lazy summer day, so as I was watching TV, I began to let my guard down and truly relax. It felt good to not be on edge for once. 

As time went on I felt an odd sensation, almost like I was weightless. Looking down I was startled to find that the recliner seemed to be off the ground! 

My feet were no longer in line with the TV! The edge of the arm of the recliner seemed to be bobbing gently up and down by a few inches. 

I immediately looked down and the floor seemed farther away. The recliner kept gently rising and falling by inches, almost in tune with my breathes. 

My brain struggled to comprehend how this was happening since the recliner was very heavy (it had taken three movers to get it into our home when we moved in) and I was fully awake. I wasn't dreaming. 

This went on for a moment longer before I silently began to think, ""down...put me down...""

Gradually the chair lowered and I felt it rest on the floor. As it did I bolted out of the chair and ran outside. This was one of the harder experiences for me to recount or try to explain. 

The last two incidents that are the most extreme happened close together.

As I described before, our condo was three floors, each level of course having it's own set of stairs. There were three steps from the kitchen up to small landing that led to the rest of the stairs that led to the third floor where all the bedrooms were. 

I remember coming out of the downstairs half bathroom off the kitchen. Wanting something in my room upstairs, I went to begin to climb the stairs. Two steps up, a thick wall of energy seemed to stop me.

Curious and tired of giving into whatever was in my home, I tried to push forward, but it was like running in sand. 

As I got farther up the stairs, the energy only seemed to get thicker and harder to walk through. 

There was a railing on the stairs that I began to cling to and use to pull myself forward. 

All around me there seemed to be a fog forming. It was bright, almost golden in hue. Half way up the stairs, I found it hard to breathe.

Through the fog, a surge of energy came straight for me, then through me. Gasping for air and falling to my knees, it was as if for a brief moment I was the same as whatever had run through me. I felt like I was transparent.

I don't remember much happening after that. It was almost as if it settled the house for a while. I'd wondered if that incident took all the energy from the home. 

Life went on and the house seemed to be ours again. My family actually began to relax and look forward to spending time in what had been my mother's dream home. 

Living in the rainy suburbs of Portland, I was used to having allergies in the Spring, and we all braced for the flu season. But I remember this particular Fall/Winter had been a rough one, and I'd come down with a virus that had made me weak with a fever. 

It kept me out of school for a week. My mom stayed home to take care of me while my dad went to work. So on this particular day my dad wasn't there. It was just my mom and I. 

I had started feeling a little better and was able to move about the house a bit. I was at a point where I no longer had my guard up, it had been weeks since anything remotely out of the ordinary had happened.

Before, I would've stayed downstairs with my mom. But by now I was tired of being afraid, and being young, I didn't understand that letting my guard down in that house wasn't a good idea. I honestly thought whatever had been happening was probably over. 

I went upstairs to wash my face. I was even so bold (or dumb) to leave the light off in the bathroom. As a side note, I got into the habit of always turning on a light in every room I was in, it just seemed to make me feel safe. 

So here I was standing in this semi-dark bathroom, the only light being a night light my parents put in a while back. The shower curtain was closed and I could hear my mom downstairs doing the dishes. 

Bending over the sink to splash water of my face, it felt so cool and refreshing after having a fever for days before. 

As I straightened, I dried my face then looked in the mirror. Two faces looked back at me, my own, and a young blond woman.

Her head was right over my shoulder. She seemed to be in her late teens, wearing a pink pioneer era looking bonnet over her hair. 

Her skin was very pale. Her eyes were expressionless, but her lips were grim and in one thin straight line.

I didn't turn around to look at the rest of her. I ran as fast as I could down the stairs to my very startled mom, I probably screamed.

This was the first and only time I've seen a spirit (?) with my own eyes. I've felt so many different presences in that condo, and later in life have had visions, but this experience was one of the most memorable. 

If I'm honest, I'd be fine if I never saw another spirit in person again. But at the same time, it was extraordinary to me. She was as clear as day, and I'll never forget her. 

Soon life changed dramatically for my family. The economy in Oregon took a down turn, both my parents lost their jobs. 

The activity in our house was replaced with my parent's sadness, especially my dad's, at loosing his job. At that time there were no jobs in the state. Eventually, my parents decided to sell the condo and move out of state to California to start over. 

It took some time, but we were lucky to find a buyer for the condo, a young woman who was looking for her first home. We needed ample time to pack up since we were moving out of state, but the woman changed her mind and wanted us out as soon as possible or she'd pull her offer. She was very anxious to move in. 

Naturally this didn't sit well with my parents, but we knew our family would fall on even harder times if we couldn't sell the condo. 

The last day of packing suddenly the small presence that used to follow me around came back stronger than ever. I remember literally throwing things into boxes in my room as quickly as I could. 

No matter how strongly I told it to leave me alone, the presence clung to my heels and followed as close behind as possible. 

We were loading up the last of our belongings, thinking we had until the evening to get things wrapped up. But the young woman who bought the condo came in early, with all her family, her moving team and vans of stuff, telling us to get out of her house. 

I could tell my parents were tired, conflicted, and frustrated. As we were loading up in our large moving van, the young woman followed my dad to the driver door telling him that she was angry with that we were delaying her move. 

In that moment my dad made the decision not to tell her that the condo was in his words ""haunted"". Being a kid at the time I wasn't involved in this decision. And I sensed that my parents were barely hanging onto our finances with a thread, if she wanted the home so badly, we'd gladly hand it over to her. 

To the best of my knowledge, we never heard from her again. I've never been back to the condo, but I've always wondered what exactly was going on there, and what caused all that activity? 

I hope you enjoyed reading about these experiences. I've been hesitant to talk about this time in my life because I wasn't sure that anyone would believe me, much less understand. Or that it would be one big joke to them. 

To this day, I still am amazed by some of things I witnessed in that condo. I have had other experiences since then that were also intense, but since I lived in the condo, I can easily say that this was the most active place I've ever been. 

Please feel free to leave your thoughts below. It's felt freeing to share them here, I've held onto these experiences long enough. 

Thanks for reading!"
"Red Orb In Bedroom","Florida","Orbs / Lights / Mists","Last night I went to bed early, my husband was in the living room as he stayed up to watch tv and my son was in the office on his computer. 

I went to sleep only to be awoken by a red orb. The Orb was hovering over my bed about 4 feet above me. 

It appeared 3 dimensional about 7 inches round. It looked as if it had a up down up down weave to the center of it. (like 2 hands interlocking fingers - or an Easter egg design)) I became fully awake and I was not scared by it. I was more curious by it because I felt as if it was checking up on me. 

I DID NOT have the feeling like it was a spirit as I have seen shadow people before and this was nothing like I had ever seen. It did not scare me at all. 

I looked at the clock and it was 9:35pm. Once it noticed I was awake it gently glided up to the ceiling and passed through it and was gone. My bedroom shades were down and no light was in the room. This was not car headlights or landscape lighting. 

I sat up and began googling from my phone, red orb in bedroom but found nothing. 

Today I looked again and saw a few stories on this website site with similar stories. 

I posted this because I just didn't want to be the only one, and if someone else had this happen to them I didn't want them to think they were crazy, yes, I believe them. 

I asked my husband and 21 year old son if they heard or saw anything now or in the past like this and they said no. 

 (A little about me) 

I do not drink, and have never ever done any drugs. I am a normal average married wife of 23 years, and mom of 49years young. I have my own business as a decorator and I live in Central Florida in a country home off of a main country highway. 

I hope my story helps someone."
"Remnants/humanoid Shadow Figures","Michigan","Shadow People","Every few months these black shadowy figures appear either on the corner nearby or across the street from my house. I believe that something horrible has happened on that corner, leading to my calling them Remnant. They are completely black, tall, and have appeared to look male. No features like a face or eyes can be seen on these figures. Anytime either I see them or they see me a horrible wave of terror and paranoia washes over me. Within the month of seeing one something horrible happens in my life. I believe they have begun to take notice to me and me noticing their presence due to the fact of the one appearing across the street. My close friend has also seen one before near her house with almost identical results. I've become desperate for information on these Remnants and any possible ways to keep them at bay or to get rid of them. 

I believe they are highly dangerous and don't recommend going to look for them. I don't wish to harm them if possible but if that's the only way to get rid of them I will do so. I don't have any contact with them seeing how I don't have a Ouija board, if anyone is willing to try and make verbal contact with one that would be greatly appreciated. If someone somehow runs across this and has any information or have had a run-in with one please email me at SylvianStarzzz@gmail.com with the subject labeled as Remnant-Info. Please do not contact me for any other reason. This story isn't fictional and I'm genuinely asking if anyone has have any type of experience with these beings."
"Childhood Tormentors","Wisconsin","Haunted Places","In 1986 my parents purchased and moved into a house. It was an older home and had been inhabited before. I have heard that during the 1970's it was owned by the boys basketball coach from the local high school; supposedly he was a pederast and was fired for making advances towards his team members. This is unsubstantiated.

I was born in 1988 and lived there until we moved to another house across town, in early 2004 (I was 15 1/2 at the time). During my childhood I experienced a variety of troubling phenomena and was very, well, troubled as a result. I constantly felt as if I was being watched, followed, and having my thoughts read; I also felt that something was listening to me while I spoke. As a result I was always afraid and could never be left alone; I was always running up and down stairs, looking behind me and looking over my shoulder. 

There was also visual and auditory phenomena. Often out of the corner of my eye I saw shadow figures darting through rooms and then disappearing. One night in the summer of 1998 I heard guttural laughter emanating from the far corner of my room; it seemed to echo and multiply itself before eventually fading and ending. In early 2003 I heard a few (2-3) tortured sounding voices calling my name, again in my bedroom.

The phenomenon was the most intense in the upstairs (my bedroom) and in the backroom of the basement. It seemed to decline and eventually end as I entered puberty.

At the time both my parents were staunch evangelical Christians who believed firmly in the existence of spirits. Oddly enough, however, my father did not take me seriously and dismissed it as a form of separation anxiety. As a result he took no action on my behalf. In hindsight I should have been taken to a therapist (to determine if this was simply a product of my mind and if so, why was my mind producing it). If it was not they should have consulted a religious official to have the house examined and, if need be, cleansed.

Alas, he did neither. In fact it didn't even occur to him to do either and I lived in torment as a result. (His lame band-aid solution was to stay up with me until I fell asleep). 

I was discussing this with my mother recently and what she said surprised me. She conceded to me that she too had experienced exactly the same phenomena. However, she began to feel it when they first moved in (1986) and for her it lasted until we moved (early 2004), basically the entire time she lived in the house. She even discussed it with my father. 

For his part he maintains he never experienced anything out of the ordinary there, except for a vague sensation of darkness once in the back of the basement. 

This has left me with nothing but questions:

Was there a connection between the activities of the previous inhabitant and what I experienced?

Why, despite my parents' religious faith, were the entities capable of entering our home and afflicting us?

Why did my mother and I experience it but not my father?

Why was my father so passive and complacent in dealing with it?

Any and all responses would be greatly appreciated."
"Spirit Voice On Beach","California","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","This is my first time writing on this site. I've been reading for almost a year since I had a few paranormal experiences after my dad passed away almost a year ago. I'll save those for later though. I'm going to start with an earlier experience, one that happened 20 years ago when I was was 22. I've always wanted to ask experts about this. It possibly involves a known ghost- The Santa Barbara Community College ""Lady in white"". Google it, I don't know if I'm allowed to put links in here. This happened a few miles north of where she is usually sighted though.

I was a normal working class guy, taking a break from college, being a beach bum at the time, staying in a small park just off Arroyo Burro beach at the north end of Santa Barbara, California. I would work and surf during the day, then hide my board in the bushes on a hillside before dark. I was having a great time and loved sleeping in my 1-person tent in the grassy park just behind the bluff. I felt super relaxed and at peace with everything. Well, until the night I decided that it would be fun to sleep on the beach instead. 

After dark, I took my sleeping bag and headed a quarter of a mile or so north away from the beach parking lot and the Rusty Pelican Restaurant at the south side of the park, which was the only building in the area. I laid down and watched the ocean for a good while. It was late and the moon was fairly bright. There was no one on the beach in any direction as far as my eyes could see and I could see at least 100 yards in every direction. I was laying 20 or so yards from the edge of the ocean and the cliffs were about 50 yards away.

It was a very quiet night and I was alone with my thoughts when suddenly I heard a woman humming directly in my ear, even though no one was there! It was a pretty and young voice softly humming a slow, random tune. I froze and listened kind of in a daze for a few seconds, not knowing what to think or feel. So I reflexively looked in all directions (still laying down) - no one in sight. I would have seen a person 100 yards away (I was 22 at the time and had great eyesight) I call out a loud friendly ""Hello?""- no answer.

As the humming continued for another half minute or so, feeling exactly like a woman had her mouth a couple inches or less from my ear, my brain feverishly searched for a rational, scientific explanation. It must be some odd acoustic effect, a woman is on the cliffs above humming and its being funneled directly into my ear by some freak air temperature inversion lens right?!?

At the time, I was deeply into Tibetan Buddhist meditation and prided myself on my ""deep understanding of the nature of reality and perception"" or something like that. 

Well, as the humming continued and my mind couldn't explain it or just be at peace with it, I began to feel a quickly increasing fear. It was just too real, too close and too weird. Before gibbering mindless panic had a chance to set in, I told myself I would count to 3, then jump up and run as fast as I could. I got out of my bag PDQ and tore down the beach back to my old campsite. 

A few days later, my brother came and we hung out there a couple days more. Then we left to another beach far down south. When I told him about what happened that night, he told me that he had felt an inexplicable, creepy discomfort on the beach at nighttime, and that's why he had talked me into leaving.

No drugs or alcohol were involved, I know that's one of the standard jokes or criticisms of skeptics. I didn't use alcohol or drugs at all during that time of my life.

After this happened to me, when I hear people mocking paranormal experiences, I just think they haven't been through it yet. 

Thanks for giving me a chance to write about this!

If anyone knows anything about the Santa Barbara Community College ""Lady in White"" or anything else this could be related to let me know!"
"Bathroom Visitors And Moving Toys","Missouri","Haunted Places","My niece came over the other day to have dinner with us. My mom needed someone to give her a ride to ballet class as well. When we were finished eating dinner I sent her to the kids' bathroom to change into her ballet outfit so that we could get ready to head to her ballet practice.

It seemed to be taking her longer than usual to get ready so I hollered for her to finish getting ready because it was almost time to go. I was in another room watching music videos with the kids to keep them busy while we waited for her to get ready. I did not get a response.

Shortly after she walks into the room we are in with watery eyes like she was trying not to cry. She looked terrified and mumbled that the bathroom creeped her out. I asked what she meant. Teary eyed and mumbling, she said that there were two tall shadowy figures staring at her in the bathroom. She refused to go anywhere in my house without me and she wouldn't go near that bathroom.

FYI: I have not shared any of my experiences with her as she is a kid. I didn't share any of my paranormal experiences with my family because I was afraid they would think I was nuts so she has had no way to hear about or know anything about the strange things happening in my home. She hasn't even been in my home since all the Paranormal Activity or weird stuff (since it may not be paranormal) started... At least as far as I can remember. 

I have since done a house cleansing on my home but I wanted to share that experience. 

I also had a shared experience with my nephew last night. My niece and nephew came over (and yes, she was still terrified and refused to go into that bathroom or be alone anywhere in my house and pretty much sat on the couch in the living room looking terrified, poor kid). My nephew happened to be walking by the hallway and got very cold. He saw a shadowy movement in my son's room so he went to check it out. He told me he saw a shadow moving around in the room and a toy moving on its own. No one else was in my son's room. The light was out so the only light was from the hallway light shining into the room. He started freaking out when he saw the toy kept moving and called me over. 

When I looked in the room I also saw a small black shadowy figure in the corner that darted away and disappeared. Then I saw the very same toy on the table that he saw moving move right in front of my eyes. The toy continued to move while he and I looked at it (on its own). At the same time I also got freezing cold and just odd feeling like it wasn't safe to be in that room. 

We prayed over the room and that night we did the house cleansing as a family since at that point all of us had experienced the activity in some way (other than my husband, but he helped with the cleansing process and was very supportive)."
"Shadow People And Weird Happenings","Indiana","Shadow People","First off, I would like to apologize in advance for how long this story is, these are several events that happened over a few years. My name is Rose, and I am in high school, the first experience happened when I was 5.

I had just moved into a new house in a different part of Indiana, a move that I did not want as I was leaving my friends I might add. When I was a kid I would always take a bath with the door open, so I did not feel alone. My mom would have me bathe upstairs while she was downstairs with my dad watching TV. Sometimes when I was in the bath a shadow man with a fedora would slowly glide pass the door. I would always get this feeling of dread and be terrified. This happened every day in broad day light mind you.

I don't remember when it started happening I just remember being five and noticing it happening. When I told my mom, she said I was just seeing ""floaters"" and eyes just do that. She said they usually just look like circles and are small but mine could be different. This went for a little while until I was so tired of being terrified all the time and complained to both my parents once more. My dad said draw what I was seeing. When I drew the picture of a black shadow in a trench coat and fedora they started closing my door when I would bathe, and everything was quiet for a while. 

Then some years later when I was 12 about to be 13 as I was laying in my bed in the dark with the door cracked I saw a shadow sprint by. Now normally I was afraid of the dark (still kind of am) and slept with my lights on but I wanted to get over it. My mom was up working, so at first, I just thought it was her. I then realized there was no reason for her to be running and she cannot run that fast. Although I did not know what I had seen I was sure it was not my mom at that point. I was very tired however and I felt no real fear this time, so I just went to sleep. 

I thought nothing of it but the next day my mom got a panic attack. It had been triggered by seeing a shadow figure sprint down the hall way whilst being in her bedroom. She called my name thinking it was me, but I was still down stairs watching Pretty little liars.

 My dad was outside cutting the grass and we have a dog that would have gone crazy if that was a burglar or thief. Knowing all this she went into a panic attack. I talked to her about it after she had calmed down which is how I found out what triggered her, she also said she had seen something running down the hall way the night before but assumed it was me and said my name, but I didn't respond. She thought nothing of it the night before. This made me remember what had happened when I was five, and she got a book of prayers and said them loudly upstairs with me while blessing the house. 

Fast forward to now, I'm in high school and some things are happening again. Neither my mom nor I have seen any shadow figures again, but I heard a muffled scream while sitting in my parent's room the other day and my mom heard a muffled cry coming from the same place, their closet, a day or two after. Now only a few more incidents have happened in between 7th grade and where I am now but they are small paranormal incidents and this story is long enough. Funny enough all the things happening now have my mom totally freaked where as I try and not pay much mind to them, I suppose the roles have reversed. I just wanted to share this story but anything any one could give some insight into would be appreciated. My mom feels as though these are demons. I think they are nothing more than a residential haunting. I would love to hear what you guys think in the comments and thanks to everyone who read this far."
"Band Of Runners","North Carolina","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I had a lot of paranormal things happen in my life when I was a child up until I got married and moved away. Not so many things happen to me anymore, and I believe it is because the place where I grew up (not only the house but the whole area), was a sort of paranormal hot spot; a portal, if you will, for the strange and unworldly. Now, this story isn't frightening and it might not even have been paranormal, but it just didn't feel right. You decide for yourself.

This happened to me about 40 years ago. I remember it was about 2:00 am when I woke up because I looked at the clock beside my bed. For some reason, I felt compelled to look out the window. I don't remember if I heard something or I just had a feeling, but for whatever reason, I got out of bed and peeked out between the blinds at the street which was illuminated by a street light. 

Running down the road was a procession of what appeared to be young men, each carrying a musical instrument. I remember one was even carrying a tuba, and they were running as fast as they could go. It was a week night and quite late for a band to have been practicing somewhere, and it just struck me as very strange. It just didn't feel right. 

It felt very surreal. In the days afterward, I never heard anything about instruments being stolen, never heard a band practicing in the area and I never saw these people again. 

One thing I do know is that sometimes things we see are a screen for what is really happening, so I often wonder what I really saw that night. Not everything is paranormal, but it just didn't feel right and it has stuck with me all these years."
"The New Condo - Pt. 1","Oregon","Haunted Places","**This is a recount of my family's experiences over a few years in a condo we lived in. Because of all the events we experienced, there will be two parts to this story, this is part one.**

I grew up mainly in apartments, but my mother always had a dream of owning her own home. Back then we lived in a suburb of Portland, Oregon in a city called Beaverton. In the late 90s the area experienced rapid growth. Part of the forest areas were mowed down to make space for a new elementary school, large grocery stores, and a the beautiful gated condo community. 

Eventually, my mother convinced my father to purchase one of the beautiful condos. It was the very last one in the building available, even the realtor mentioned how no one seemed to choose it. But my mom was in love with it, and to unload the lingering condo, they gave us a bit of a deal. 

It was a row house style condo - three stories tall. The garage on the bottom floor, kitchen and living room on the second, and the two bedrooms and bathrooms on the third. 

My family was so hopeful. We bought new furniture and I started in a new school I actually liked. My parents, being of Catholic faith, had a priest bless our new home. 

Life was normal, for about a year. 

Then one day I was doing my homework at the large dining room table. Focused on my studying, the room was quiet. Then suddenly I felt as if someone was watching me, very closely. I looked up but no one was there.

Trying to ignore the feeling, I went back to studying. Moments went by and the feeling of the eyes got stronger, closer somehow. Like someone was walking toward me. Looking over my shoulder, I saw nothing. But now the goosebumps up my arms started, the air was thick. 

Sitting very still I kept my eyes down, until I felt the gaze just inches from the side of my face. It was as if someone was standing face to face with me - their eyes inches from my skin. The feeling intensified until I got up from the table and ran away, running to my dad who was upstairs.

Nights later I was walking into my bedroom, and a small light floated across the middle of the space, before disappearing into thin air. 

I later found out they were called Orbs. And there were always a couple floating around at night, some were white, some where other colors but they disappared quickly. I thought it was a trick of the eyes for a while, but later my theory would be put to the test. 

As the feelings of being watched continued for me, my parents admitted to having their own experiences too. 

My mother would often work the night shift at her job. When she would come home from work at night, she would unwind with a cup of tea in the kitchen. 

She said she would hear loud bangs coming from the third floor, like someone was dropping heavy objects on the floor. When she would go upstairs to check on everyone, there would be nothing out of place, and everyone was sleeping. 

My dad was doing dishes in the kitchen at the sink and out of the blue he heard someone shout right in his ear, but he was completely alone. 

Around this time is when the poking started. 

First with me in the shower, in the middle of my lower back. Then my dad, again when he was in the kitchen, in the same spot as me, in his lower back. It was always just one quick jab/poke in the back, almost as if someone was trying to get our attention or playing a joke.

There were days and sometimes weeks when nothing would happen, giving us a sense of normalcy. It was during one of these weeks that I was coming up the stairs to the third floor to get ready for bed. Just at the top of the stairs, I looked up into my bedroom. 

In the darkness, my room was filled with hundreds of light orbs. All sizes and colors, swirling around one another. I was frozen in wonder. Unable to believe what I was seeing. But they were all there. 

As I continued to watch all the orbs, a large bright white orb came through the middle of the room and they all followed, disappearing a second later. 

I still have a hard time believing what I saw, and have no explanation. My bedroom was at the back of our condo, facing another condo building, not near any roads that could produce headlights. 

It was at this point that my parents tried a second blessing on the condo. I'm not sure than any of us believed it would help, but we weren't sure where else to turn. 

By now my parents and I were believers that something was definitely going on in our home, but nothing would prepare us for what would happen next."
"Always At Bedtime","Virginia","Haunted Places","As most of you know by now, my apartment overlooks a lovely little park that serves not only as a refreshing green space in the city but also a buffer from the busy street. It's real raison d'etre, however, is for what is to be found beneath the ground. It is a mass grave. 

In 1855, the steam ship Benjamin Franklin came up from St. Thomas Island unwittingly bearing yellow fever. It made port in Portsmouth, across the river where the plague first made landfall in the tenement housings there. Attempts were made at the time to quarantine but lacking a developed understanding of germ theory, all attempts quickly proved futile and the deadly disease soon spread to the larger city of Norfolk to wreak havoc. 

Those stricken were dying faster than graves could be dug no more or less proper funerals conducted. The desperate city resorted to mass burials in lesser inhabited areas. One such area at the time was Lambert's Point. A pit was dug there and approximately 500 late citizens of the city of Norfolk there laid to rest. Seventy years later, the apartment building where later I would live was constructed right next door. 

As one might imagine, given our rather darkly picturesque location, residents here do have their share of paranormal activity - my husband and I being no exception. I feel that much of the activity potential to our apartment is mitigated by the constant watching presence of my maternal grandparents' spirits (those discussed in 'Coming to Say Goodbye') - but as I have come to discover over the six years we have lived here, some entities still find a way through. Strangely, most of the activity is centered in the bedroom - specifically in bed (believe me - hah! I *know* how that sounds and, trust me, I don't mean 'hanky panky' nor are our spirits that way inclined!) 

I have not as yet begun to keep a diary of my experiences here (shame on me, I know) but every time something happens, it always seems so small and insignificant that I shrug it off after calming down and it isn't until days later, after ruminating on it, that I see how it fits into the greater context of other events and see its significance. Thus with my promise that I will in future mend my feckless ways and start my journal and the hope that for now you will bear with me, on to my best possible reconstruction of events. I have put the events in the order that they have occurred - the first beginning, I believe in 2014, roughly 2 years after we moved in.

The first thing I remember is very simple. I was laying in bed in the dark with my sleeping mask on as there was still light flooding in from the bedroom door from the living room etc since my husband (Andy) was still up doing dishes. It typically takes me quite a long time to fall asleep and I am a light sleeper with very clear lines between sleeping and awake (I don't wake up groggy or hazy - I go straight from dead sleep to fully alert on waking no matter how sudden). Thus I laid there waiting for sleep trying to clear my head of the day's concerns. It was then I heard the footsteps creaking over the aging hardwood of the hall down to the bedroom, across the threshold, around the bed and over to my husband's side. A few moments passed as I lay there with my mask still on wondering why he was just standing there beside the bed... And it distinctly felt as though he was staring at me. 

As the moments ticked by I couldn't fathom what he was doing just standing and staring and why he had come to bed without turning out the living room lights (the elastic on my sleep mask is basically shot so a bit of light still creeps in around the edges). Finally, and a bit irritated, I pulled up my mask and looked over at...nothing. He wasn't there. Then I heard the sink turn on in the kitchen meaning the real Andy was still in there washing dishes. 

I know I was blindfolded so could not have seen anyone (or thing) passing out of the room but I have freakishly good hearing (one more reason why I sleep so lightly) and the building's sagging foundation conspires with its aging wood floors to create an unmistakable and very distinctive sound when feet bearing human-type weight pass over them - you can't miss it and it does not happen on its own. This sort of thing has happened several times - always at night when I've just gone to bed.

The next incident, I was again in bed (lights out, mask on) and Andy either taking a shower or doing the dishes. Again, I was waiting for sleep, knowing it probably wouldn't come until all activities (human ones at least) had ceased. I began to sense the presence of someone else in the room. I flipped up my mask and had a look about but saw nothing. The AC and fan were on so if the room had suddenly gotten cold, I likely wouldn't have noticed. So I replaced my mask and decided to ignore it. That's when I felt something grab the toes of my right foot through the covers! I shot up tearing off my mask and switching on the light in one lightening fast motion to find myself starring yet again at nothing in my empty room. 

Sometime between these events - my chronology is good if my precise dates are not. My husband had an experience, which he related to me. We were both in bed, I was asleep and he was awoken by the feeling of a cold hand traveling slowly up his arm, over his shoulder and coming to rest at his throat. It went away when he sat up in alarm. I experienced nothing that night.

Next incident - once again I'm in bed, lights out, mask on, Andy elsewhere in the apartment- noticing a trend here? Again I hear the footsteps coming down the hall, into the room and around the bed. This never frightens me because I always assume its Andy. I feel him get into bed and after a moment, he rolls over towards me and gently says ""Hey, sweetheart"" as though to wake me up without startling me. I roll over to find out what's going on to once again find myself alone. Then I noticed the sound of dishes clinking about in the kitchen and realize, once again, Andy is still in the kitchen and I, in fact, am ""alone"" in our room. 

The next incident - same set up: me, bed, lights out, mask on. Same footsteps, down the hall, into the room, around the bed. Once again, I feel it get into bed - this time, I somehow know it isn't Andy (for those of you thinking 'Well, about time, lady!' lol I hear the same thing every night when it actually IS Andy. Given how normal these sounds are, it is very difficult to discern between the usual and the not so usual until I get tipped off in the end). It rolls over and I can feel a warm body against my back and breath in my ear. Let me stress here that I distinctly sensed absolutely NOTHING sexual about this encounter. All the while, I can hear Andy mucking about in the kitchen. The entity wrapped an arm around me so we were spooning. My mind was reeling - torn between instinctual terror of the unknown and what seemed to be an insistence coming from the entity NOT to be afraid. It seemed desperate that I not feel any fear as though it just wanted to be near a warm living human being just for a few moments but meant no harm. So I willed myself to relax and just laid there with it until I fell asleep. 

I got the distinct impression it was a middle aged man and could 'see' him laying there behind me in my mind's eye. I can't recall his face but I do recall he was wearing a button down shirt, belt and pants. I awoke that morning unable to recall my dreams but knowing they had been pleasant and feeling unaccountably peaceful and happy. 

I have since heard whispering in that room sounding like a conversation between a middle aged man (possibly the same one) and a young girl - I could not make out the words and this has only happened once.

The last event of note that I will mention here happened just the other night (wee hours of the morning May 9, 2018) and it is what prompted me to write down all of this. Bear in mind that for the last week, one of my cats (Vera - a very intelligent 18 month old female) has been behaving a bit unusually in that room at night - when she hops up on the bed, instead of pestering me or cuddling, she stands rather tensely at the edge on my side and stares fixedly up into the corner above my side of the bed. 

So back to May 9th, I had awoken sometime around 4:45AM (I looked at my phone at what I took to be the conclusion of the event). I don't know what precisely woke me but it is not uncommon for me to wake up at various points during the night - generally between one and five in the morning for no reason really so I ascribe no particular significance to this. After laying there for a few minutes debating whether I was going to be able to fall back asleep, whether it was worth it to get up and go to the bathroom or get a glass of water, or if I should try reading something boring on my phone until I grew drowsy once more, suddenly I felt something jump up on the bed. I lifted my head expecting to see one of my two cats at the foot but saw nothing. Assuming I was imagining things, I plopped my head back down and continued my fruitless debate until a few moments later, I felt it again. Once more, I checked the foot of the bed and saw nothing. 

While actively trying to quash the growing sense of unease, I slowly probed a foot back and forth across the area to see if I would find a warm wee cat body there hidden amongst the bed clothes to explain the thumps and allay my fears. Nothing. I took a deep breath, let it out and decided that I should ignore it - rolled over, turning my back and attempted once more to review my 'to sleep' options without much success. 

After a moment, it started to move again, now it's coming up the bed. It got to my knee and I rolled over to look again only to once more find stillness and nothing. Laid back down and rolled back over - by this point unable to force myself to think about much else but hoping this is all just my imagination and it'll stop. Another few moments go by and it started to move again - this time up to my hip. I peeked again. Nothing. By this point, I couldn't help it, I was scared. Wrapping myself tighter in my sheet, I tried as hard as I could to think of happy things and white light. This time the movement continued on up and paused at my shoulder. Just as I was about ready to jump out of my skin, I felt a firm nudge on my shoulder. In a flash I sat up throwing off the covers and turned on the light... Only to find a freshly awoken and quite dumbfounded husband blinking into the glare. 

So there you have it, the greatest part of the activity in my home. I have hunch that I have a father and daughter though that doesn't quite explain that last encounter as it seemed too small to be human. I am a rational person with a good education grounded in science and I have gone over and over each experience in my head to try to rule out logical explanations (EMFs, structural settling, thermodynamics, jolts from heavy trucks, sounds from neighboring units, cats, fan, AC... Just plain crazy lol) but nothing can account for what I have experienced. All but Andy's experience and the most recent have occurred between ten PM and midnight during various seasons of the year.

Please, I am not Christian and have had several negative experiences with various denominations of said faith in my life- I would appreciate it if that stance would respected. I tend towards spiritualism and paganism."
"Spirit Likes Me? - Please Help?","Texas","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","Lately I've dabbled with contacting a certain spirit (will not say who) via EMF and ever since that day I've had weird encounters.

I feel like these tickle-like touches on my face, hands, as well as my legs and feet. I always feel like fingers are lightly touching my hair and dragging them down and then repeating that action. I'll also feel like someone lightly poking at my head and will put my hand on said spot and then it stops.

Whenever that would happen, I would use my EMF and ask if it woke me up and it blinks green, which means yes.

For two nights straight I woke up around 3 am for no apparent reason. Again, I've used the EMF to ask if he woke me up and it blinked green. I asked if he was going to do it again and it blinked green, which explained the second time I woke up at 3 am.

Whenever I finish a session love songs play, even though I don't own that many love songs, it's usually like jpop or other foreign music. I usually ask if he can somehow control the music playing and it blinked green.

Today at lunch I as talking to a few friends and I felt like this light finger touching my cheek. I tried my best to ignore it, which somehow worked. I was hearing music on my phone and every song was about love and missing you and overall topics that surrounded love. A few songs even had like ""I'm waiting for you, love"" lyrics. I was kind of freaked out.

At night I'll hear noises or sometimes watch a shadow, but so far it hasn't misplaced things or thrown anything, nor have I woken up with scratches, so I'm assuming that it's not a bad spirit 

I'd use a Ouija Board to get a more thorough answer, but I'm too scared.

I actually asked it if I should a Ouija Board and it blinked dark green, which means no. I told it that I was tempted to and it blinked no. I asked if the Ouija Board overall is a bad and dangerous item (I acted dumb) and it blinked green.

It seems to always be in my room whenever I decide to do a session. I once asked it if it likes hanging around my room and talk to me and it blinked green.

Can someone help me explain why? Was it because I contacted it first?"
"Attacked By Ghost Cat?","Florida","Pets / Animals","I've lived in the same house for 19 years and for almost that long we have had a ghost cat that kneads on the bed sporadically. I've had houseguests that have also experienced the same sensation.

Lately, however, my spouse and I have both been glimpsing small black shapes very briefly, maybe once or twice a week. But then last night around 3:30 a.m. I was having a hard time sleeping, so I was semi-awake when something small (the cat?) jumped on the foot of the bed, ran the length of the bed, went around my head and to the floor. A few seconds later it jumped back up in attack mode. I didn't see or hear anything but I felt like I was being bitten and scratched like it was in a frenzy. It really hurt at that moment but then it was gone, and so was the pain. 

I don't have a mark on me, but I'm scared to death to go to bed tonight. Could this have been our docile ghost cat? If so, what happened? I've had paranormal experiences several times in my life but they have never been threatening. I have never dealt with anything like this and am at a loss as to how to understand it. I would greatly appreciate any advice! 

I've read some of the stories here searching for something similar but the closest I've found is several people being held down. That didn't happen to me. It all happened within a couple minutes. I don't know if it means anything but I was sleeping by myself last night. Also there has been no unusual stressors or other events lately that could have triggered something negative."
"Temporary Blindness","New York","Haunted Places","I remembered this incident after talking with my brother about our grandparents' house recently. Technically, they are my step-grandparents, but I'm sure some of you will agree that ""blood isn't always thicker than water"". 

My grandmother is a wonderfully fierce, Italian firecracker crammed into a 4'-9"" body. My grandfather passed away when I was 15 years old. He always had a joke to tell and a great sense of humor. 

When I was about 10 - 11 years old, my grandmother and grandfather lived in a duplex they owned. For those that don't know, a duplex appears to be a single residence from the outside with the exception of two doors/entryways that access the two inner residences. There is one wall inside separating them. My grandparents' duplex was a two story with a shared basement. My uncle and aunt lived in the second half, so it always felt like one big home anyway.

My stepfather (although I rarely call him that, he is my dad 😊) has told me stories of growing up there and the strange experiences they had. I admit, at first, I thought he was just telling me ""stories"". But over the years I've asked my grandmother about the house (my aunt, uncle and grandmother moved to a single residence about 15 years ago) and she confirmed my dad's stories. 

First, I want to share a few experiences my dad and grandmother have told me, then I will share my incident as there may be a connection. I'm not sure. 

My father told me that he, his younger brother and parents all heard the typical ""ghostly"" footsteps going up the stairs at night and hearing disembodied voices. A few incidents that stood out to me... 

As a young boy of about 5 - 6 years old, my uncle saw what he described as a ""ball of fire"" enter the house through the living room wall. In the center of the fireball was a man's face that he described as a ""very scary man"", the face distorted with intense eyes. It floated in the living room for a short time, then zoomed into the kitchen and went through the wall (the backyard was on the other side of the kitchen wall). I did ask my father, uncle and grandmother separately about this and they all recounted the same details. My uncle gave more details as he was the only one to see it and at the time, ran screaming to his mother. 

This next incident occurred while my grandparents, uncle and my dad were sitting in the living room watching TV, relaxing after dinner. My father was 16 at the time, my uncle was 12. It's a doozy, but please remember I asked my grandmother about this and she is not the type to exaggerate or tell ""stories"". I am repeating her exact words. 

While sitting in the living room, they heard what sounded like dishes clattering. My grandmother and father, who were seated closer to the kitchen doorway, glanced into the kitchen. As soon as they looked, a set of cupboard doors (above the counter) opened and the dishes/plates floated straight out, hovered in the air for about 2 or 3 seconds then dropped to the floor, smashing the majority of the dishes. My grandfather and uncle only heard the clattering, smashing and saw the subsequent mess. My grandmother and father saw the whole incident start to finish. My dad gave the same details as my grandmother. My uncle confirmed the details of hearing the clattering, smashing and seeing the mess immediately after. As I stated above, my grandfather passed away when I was 15, so I cannot offer his details. 

Trust me, I know that sounds pretty crazy. When I asked my grandmother, I only said ""Dad told me about a story involving floating dishes, do you remember anything about that?"" She said ""Oh yes!"" and repeated the same story as my father. She is now 85, sharp as ever, still doing her housework, sewing, and loves to chat while chain smoking her cigarettes. No bologna from grandma. 

Now, for my experience, which is far less dramatic, but has boggled my mind on and off for almost 30 years. As I mentioned, I was about 10 - 11 years old and my family (mom, dad, my two brothers and myself) were visiting with my grandparents. It wasn't a special holiday, just us visiting on the weekend as we lived a good 45 minutes away. My grandparents' house was small; a rectangular kitchen with a doorway that led into the living room (not open concept), the bathroom and two bedrooms were upstairs.

While there, I went upstairs to use the bathroom and afterwards decided to check out... Ok, snoop in my grandparents' bedroom. It was always meticulously clean and organized, as was the rest of the house. My grandmother never had a job outside of the house. She is from the era of mom staying at home, cooking, cleaning, raising kids, etc. She is still meticulous to this day. I liked to sneak in to their room and look at or sometimes carefully touch the various knick knacks or play with my grandmother's brush and combs on her dresser. 

For some reason, I don't remember why, I decided to slide under their bed. Maybe because, unlike my own bed, theirs was completely clean, with no objects crammed underneath it. I also remember that there wasn't a dust ruffle, so while under the bed, my view was unobstructed. A few moments after I had slid underneath, I was facing the doorway on my belly and suddenly went completely blind. I remember flailing around at first, rapidly blinking my eyes, feeling surprised, trying to figure out what was going on. Then, I cried out for my mom who was downstairs (she didn't hear me). I started edging my way out, sliding my body towards the edge of the bedframe and poof... My vision returned. I panicked, ran out of the room and down the stairs. I never said anything to my parents or grandparents about this. First, I really didn't know what had happened and second, I HAD been snooping, so I just kept my mouth shut. I never went in their room again. 

This incident left me baffled. It was the middle of the day, the sun shining in the two windows. The temporary blindness was instant - I could see out from under the bed, and the next instant - complete blackness. The blindness lasted maybe 10 - 15 seconds.

I don't know if this has anything to do with something paranormal, but because of the prior experiences of my father's family, they might be connected. I do remember feeling terrified and panicky. I've never experienced anything like that since. 

I'm wondering if anyone has experienced something like this? Any insight is appreciated. Thank you!"
"Dark Beings Haunting Me","Texas","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I am really going out on a limb here because I feel like people who are on this site won't think I'm crazy. So here it goes.

I feel like I cannot get away from spirits and it has been this way since I was very young. Growing up, in our home in Arizona I used to tell my parents about ""the people downstairs"" and would ask them ""don't you hear the people downstairs""? 

We then moved to Nevada. I was around ages 9-15. This is when things really began to take a dark turn and it seems like only dark entities are drawn to me now. At night, I would sleep with my door open due to my older sister's room being right next to mine. I would be sleeping and something would cause me to just wake up, and I would see it in the hallway. It was tall, it would never speak, and it would rarely walk. It was always on the walls slowly moving. (My heart is pounding as I am writing this, recollecting these memories is much more intense than I thought). It would put its long arms in the doorway and look around my room almost like it was looking for something, making sure that I knew that it saw me, and it would skulk down the hallway into my sister's room. This happened until I was about 13, because I began shutting my door and leaving the hall light on. 

This being looked almost like it wasn't fully dense if that makes sense, sort of transparent but still very dark/black. Things amplified when I was 14 and had stayed at a family friend's house with a friend one night. As soon as I walked into this house, I felt as if angry eyes were burning into my body from the top of their staircase. I tried to ignore it. 

My friend and I fell asleep on the couch. We are tall, so my friend was laying above me on the couch and my body took up the rest, like a long snake. Same thing again, something just made me wake up. Immediately I noticed that my blanket had been pulled off and was oddly far from my body. Then I saw it. It was standing at the bottom of the stairs. It was taller than any NBA player I have ever seen; at least 9-10 ft tall. I was so confused, I sat there for at least 12 minutes just staring at it; I had no idea what it was! I thought possibly it was a coat rack, I thought it was the wife playing a prank on me (because she was crazy like that). Then it hit me. I realized what I was looking at was not human and immediately the mood shifted. I felt tense, I wanted to scream or cry but I just couldn't, I was in shock. Then it began to move, I think it saw me constantly looking down the hallway because I knew that was my way out. 

In a panic, I remembered my friend was laying right there. I grabbed her foot and basically jumped on top of her. It did not like that. It moved a great lunge forward. I then began yelling, saying ""THE LIGHT! TURN ON THE LIGHT!"" Thankfully my friend, also in a panic, sprung up and flicked on the lamp, almost knocking it off the end table. Just like that it was gone. 

Within a minute people were downstairs in a panic, asking us what was going on. I told them everything and of course I received the basic response, ""Oh, you were probably just dreaming."" 

The months following that, I constantly felt like something was looming over me. When I showered I felt something there, when I was watching tv, even when I was not at my own home I knew something was there. My room became such a negative space that, when I would have sleepovers, I began just having us stay in the guest bedroom downstairs. 

I made the mistake one night of forgetting to close the door. The door opening showed the middle of our staircase and part of the formal living room. Like clockwork, I was just suddenly awake. I then saw something standing at the top of the stairs, a million thoughts were running through my head. This sense of dread came over me, and for the first time I felt like if I did anything I would get hurt. I never try to engage the things I see, I only think things in my head. As I was telling myself I was probably just seeing something that wasn't there and that it was probably just the trick of the lighting, it raised its hand and placed it onto the railing. I pulled the covers over my head and latched onto my friend, praying that it would go away. It seemed like I was begging for hours under the covers but refused to pull my head out. I had never felt so terrified. 

I then began being unable to shake these beings from my head. It is as if I could see them, really see them. Some nights as the dinner table, there was a thing that would be under the table. I knew it was there, I could feel its energy. I didn't want to look under the table. It was as if it was crouching at my feet. It was dirty, and it got enjoyment from how tense it made me. It would wear a dirty white shirt or dress, had dark dirty hair, and it really wanted me to look down at it. When I would refuse to look down at it, it would get angry. Like I said, I could feel its energy. That was the last being I saw in that house. 

The same feelings of being watched persisted, until we moved to Texas when I was 16. (If you are wondering why we moved so often, my father was in the Air Force.) Things were calm at first. For once I felt lighter and could fall asleep in peace. 

My grandfather passed away a few months later. I feel like this is when the activity picked up again. It started with my guitar, which I kept downstairs by the mantel. It would sound like someone would violently run their fingers across the strings, causing a sudden and loud noise to echo in the house. For about a month that went on, and I would just say, ""Oh hi Grandpa"" or something along those lines. 

My wisdom teeth began to come in, so I had them removed. I was taking painkillers and would just sleep on the couch. I was woken up one afternoon because I felt like someone was touching my hair and I heard what sounded like a young girl's voice. I thought that it was the painkillers messing with my head and didn't think anything of it. 

We lived in a large lake house, so family friends would come over often and some would stay for the weekend. We also had a guest house. One Saturday morning, one of my father's friends came down and joked to my dad asking, ""Hey what were you doing in my room last night?"" My dad went on saying that he didn't go in there and that no one did after we went to bed. I began to get goosebumps. It's like something was listening and was happy that I was on edge. His friend still looking confused said, ""What, there's no way! There was a man walking around my room last night. He was opening and closing the drawers and walking around."" I felt sick and went outside. Sometimes I feel like being in the sunlight and being outside helps me. I knew now that I definitely wasn't crazy! 

About an hour later, everyone was outside hanging out. The couple who stayed in the guest house the previous evening was talking about how they saw a little girl last night. They said that she looked young, had blonde hair and was just an average young girl. Are you kidding me? I thought to myself! The little girl I heard weeks ago wasn't me hallucinating from the pain killers, someone was in that room with me.

I feel like some of you reading this may think that I'm making all of this up, but I really am not. I wish every day that I could not see or hear these beings. It is torturous and miserable.

The feeling of being watched never went away. Some days when I was getting ready for school, a feeling of sadness or dread would come over me. For some reason my mind would immediately go to the little girl. 

I began to start seeing full body forms again. One afternoon while I was napping, something caused me to randomly wake up. I was facing the couch cushions, turned over and saw it. On the other couch there was something sitting straight upright. It was dark, had its hands at its sides, looked like it had no hair of any kind, and it turned its head slowly and looked at me. I ran outside and stayed on our porch swing for hours. 

I began having the same two dreams for over a year, almost every night. Something was standing at the end of my bed, just watching me. The feeling was not fearful, but it was like it was curious about me. The second dream involved the small girl, but I never saw her face. We were always walking somewhere, and it was bright. 

In Texas, sometimes it is very stormy some days and it will just rain all day. This storm persisted into the night, there was lighting and thunder. A giant clap of thunder woke up me in my room, then a bright lightning strike lit up my room. There was something standing in the corner of my room. The feeling of dread and fear crept into my body, for some reason I felt frozen. In my head, I felt if I turned on the lights, I would regret it or be hurt. I waited for another lighting strike to light up my room. I was on the verge of tears. Unfortunately, a long lighting strike shed light onto the thing watching me. It leaned forward, and it was smiling. It wanted to hurt me, I was sure of it. It looked dirty. I am almost certain it was the thing sitting on the couch upright that one day. 

I refused to sleep in my room. I would fall asleep every night in our media room with the lights on and the TV on. My family thought I was just imagining things and that I was causing my mind to see things. Things started to get worse. I got so desperate, I took my mattress into the media room and would sleep out there so I could actually try to sleep. Some nights I took sleeping pills because I could feel them; they wanted to be around me. 

Just to clarify, I do not engage these things. I do not seek them out. I have never tried to contact spirits or anything else.

I woke up one night because I was extremely hot and somewhat disoriented. I turned over, I was facing the couch. I saw legs and feet. I looked up slowly, there was something sitting on the couch. It looked human like, but I knew it wasn't. It began to slowly put its arms up. By this point I was just exhausted and wanted the nightly torments to stop. I hurried myself under my blankets, shut my eyes and was about to pray. But when I shut my eyes it was like they were still open. I could see a face so clearly, it was as if it was right in front of my face. It looked like an older man with deep set wrinkles, pulled back white hair and deep, intriguing eyes. I flung myself out of the room. The house was black. I turned on every light I could. My heart was beating so fast, it was almost painful. I stayed in the living room that night. 

I began spending less time at home, staying at my friends' houses when I could. Things weren't as bad when I was out of the house. But unfortunately, the dreams would happen if I wasn't at home, without fail they would happen. 

It was summer time now and I went on a vacation with my family. We went to Las Vegas. I had the dream where I was with the little girl. It was going the same, I could not see her face, we were going somewhere and it was bright. This time the dream shifted. I tell myself this happened maybe because I was so far away from my home and the beings were angry. Things began to get dark, I was staring at the small girl, her back to me, she began to turn around. The moment I saw her face, it was not the face of a child. It began to grow in size, her body was hunched and large, her face was not human, not animal. Just imagine the face of something you cannot even put into words. It began to yell and shriek in something I could not understand. I forced myself to wake up, my heart was pounding so hard and I was sweating. Luckily, I did not see any dark beings in my room. 

When we got back from our vacation, I had some friends over. We had been at the lake all day and came back due to us being hungry. I was in our kitchen, grabbing some fruit from the refrigerator. As I shut the door and turned towards the island, I saw a man. I believe this is the first and only ""ghost"" I have seen to this day. He was around 5'4"", he was bald, no facial hair, wearing jeans and a tucked in short-sleeved plaid shirt, and he also had a brown belt. He was looking into our dining room, just standing there and looking. He was light and somewhat flowy. I was still shocked and took off running towards my friends.

I had never seen or heard the man was ""walking around and opening and closing the drawers"" until one night. Luckily, I only heard him. I was on the phone with my friend, my parents were not home. I now had many lights in my bedroom and had a large TV now. Since my parents were not fans of me taking over the media room, I relocated back into my room. 

As soon as I got off the phone with my friend, it began. It was like it knew I was preoccupied. The door leading to our garage began to slam so hard it was echoing throughout the house, BAM BAM BAM BAM! I began to panic, was there an actual person in my house? The banging suddenly stopped, it was quiet for a few seconds, then I heard it. It was walking up the stairs, I could hear every footstep. I sunk deep into my bed, trying so hard to be silent. My heart was pounding so hard I could hear it inside me. Something briskly passed by my door, thank god. Then I heard it. The drawers in my bathroom were opening and closing. Over and over, the drawers would open, close, open, close. I then heard the being let out a disgusting hacking cough. I compare it to someone who is a chain smoker. I could hear the fluid in its lungs. 

I told myself I would not let it come into my room. Luckily, I had a large patio connected to my room. I grabbed my phone and slid out the door. I pushed myself up against the wall as much as I could and began calling my friend who lived right down the road. I was breathing heavy and whispering, ""It's in my house! You need to come over here, it is in my house!"" She took it as a legit person was in my house and called the police. They came and searched the woods, the whole house, they found nothing. 

I am currently 23, live in an apartment and go to college full time. I recently moved into a new place and it is happening again. I am being watched. Something stands at the end of my bed and watches me, my dog even stares sometimes. It enjoys the bathroom. When I shower I feel it, I know that it is above me on the wall. I can feel it peering down at me. I saw it the mirror today. It is tall and dark. 

Sorry for any typos. I feel like when I think about them, they know, and they try to interact with me.

Please, if anyone knows what I can do to get rid of these things, I DO NOT WANT ANY SPIRITS AROUND ME. Any advice will mean the world to me. 

Thank you,

Paige C."
"Red Hood","Pennsylvania","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I swear that every word is true as best as I can remember. I am 24 years old and this happened when I was about 13-14 years old and my brother was 16-17, it was mid May and we had only been in our new house for about a year. So my brother and I were up late for some reason, it was about 2 A.M. And we both had this feeling to go to the front of our house, this was already unusual because we weren't in the same room or even talking to each other but we both got up at the same time. We headed toward the living room and looked out the window toward the street, it was a little foggy which wasn't unusual for the time of year at first we didn't see anything so we looked away and talked for a bit after about a minute we looked back outside to see a figure in a red hood and red scarf moving fast down the middle of the road, almost a sprint but not quite that fast. As freaked out as we were, we watched but felt like we had to hide ourselves so we didn't get spotted. The figure moved very smoothly for how fast it was and vanished into the fog, almost melting into it. 

Of course we both freaked out and ran into my brothers room and checked out our windows for the figure hoping it didn't see us, we tried to rationalize what we had seen but couldn't think of anything. The next day we told our Mom what we had seen but she didn't believe us, and yes she does also believe in ghost and such, she thought we had made it up just because we wanted too. To this day neiher me or my brother have seen it since but also never found anything out about what we may have seen."
"Noisy Night - Barking Dog And Voice In The Baby Monitor","Missouri","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","Last night I was playing on my computer in my bedroom for some down time. The door was open into the living room. I have the baby monitors on so I can hear the kids. My dog was sitting at my feet. I'm checking e-mail. Everyone else is asleep. It's quiet. It's peaceful.

Suddenly the dog just starts barking like crazy at the doorway. The hair is standing up on her neck and she is staring at our open door barking aggressively but not moving. She looks scared. I get this feeling of dread but when I look up I don't see anything in the doorway or living room from my computer chair so I have no idea what she is barking at. I try to convince myself maybe she just heard something outside but none of my other dogs are barking. They are all sound asleep. I can see them from where I am sitting. No reaction from any other pet. This dog is freaking out at my doorway in the mean time.

I try to get her to hush but she just growls and barks. She is not backing down, just staring at the doorway. The barking wakes up my husband. He walks through the door to go see what is going on but doesn't find anything. The dog stops barking as soon as my husband walks through the doorway. She cowers like she's afraid, hops on our bed, shivering and shaking but doesn't bark the rest of the night.

We check on the kids to make sure the dog didn't wake anyone up. Luckily, they were both sound asleep. My hubby goes back to sleep and I finish checking my e-mail.

Not long after I hear a male voice on the baby monitor say ""whip her"". It freaks me out so I wake up my hubby and tell him what I heard. We move the kids to our room, I say some prayers and nothing else happens. Ghost or night time sounds?"
"Hallway Shadow Figures","Oregon","A Haunted Life","One of my earliest experiences started with an apartment my parents moved us into. Just a regular two bedroom apartment in the suburbs of Portland, Oregon. It had a large living room with a long highway that connected the front living room and kitchen to two bedrooms and two bathrooms on the other end of the apartment. 

I was about seven at the time. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary at first, but months later, at night when the lights went out, I was laying in bed at the end of the hall. Trying to fall asleep, I did my best to ignore the dark, and the shadows of the trees moving in the wind outside. 

As my eyes continued to roam around the room, my eyes caught on two shadows by the door. As my eyes adjusted to the dark, I realized that the shadows weren't of trees or the furniture, but they were in the shape of two human forms. One taller and one shorter, but both were black shadows, completely opaque and darker than any other shadow around them. And unlike the shadows of the trees, they weren't moving. The smaller of the two shadow figures seemed to be peering at me from around the corner, like a child peeking in on someone. I stayed stock still until they were gone. I told no one. 

Time went by and the small shadow returned once by itself one other time. Still I didn't think my parents would believe me. 

But one day as we were leaving the apartment, Dad went to turn on the hallway light and it didn't work. We checked the circuit breaker, and nothing had been tripped. We changed the light bulb, and two new light bulbs in a row didn't work. We called the apartment maintenance and no one could figure out the issue. The next day, the lights turned on without an issue. By then, my parents started to wonder what was going on with this place. Everything seemed to be centered around this hallway, the shadows, the lights suddenly not working...

Then my family was having dinner and a movie in our back room. Dad asked me to get something he forgot in the kitchen. It was a bright sunlit afternoon, and nothing had happened for weeks. I walked down the hall without fear, thinking of nothing in particular. 

The minute I came to the other end and got to our living room, I stopped dead in my tracks. There, by the computer desk in the living room, stood the same two shadows, just as dark and opaque as before, standing against the blinding daylight. 

I ran back down the hall to my parents, finally screaming out what I'd seen, but when they came back to the living room with me, the shadow figures were gone. 

Even though these incidents were rather tame compared with what happened to me in the years to follow, it opened my eyes to the world of the paranormal. Once this happened, I could never go back to the innocent idea Casper was the only ghost, or scary stories were told just during Halloween. It was a world that would always seem to find me.

In the back of my mind I'm always leery of homes with long hallways, since hallways seem to enter other paranormal experiences I've had over years. Does anyone else have a theory about hallways somehow being related to the paranormal? 

I will be sharing other experiences here soon, and they only get more intense as the years go on."
"Never Knew Why","Idaho","Misc","My story begins in Boise, Idaho, in the summer of 1960 when I was six years old.

My aunt moved to Boise from Greenville, New York that summer and the was no spare bedroom for her so my parents moved the bunk beds my younger sister and I shared from our bedroom to an odd shaped hall that was full of huge windows all the way around the side of the room that we slept in. I slept on the top bunk.

I enjoyed being able to look out the windows and see the moon and the stars at night. I would stare at them until I fell asleep. I'm not sure how many night went by before something very strange began to happen to me. 

Late at night after everyone was in bed asleep, I would be awakened by a feeling of someone gently lifting me up off of my bed. Only it was toward the ceiling. I could touch it with my hands. I did touch it. Many times. I could feel the heat of the ceiling with my hands and also on my face. 

I would feel weightless and the blanket, or sometimes just the top sheet, would be over me. I would put my hand underneath me and feel that I was raised up off the bed. I would look around at the tops of the windows over my feet and see the stars. I know I was awake!

Then all of a sudden I would begin to lower back down onto my bed again. It felt weird! I touched the bed as lightly as possible. I would lay there wondering what happened. What did that to me?

A few days went by and the same thing was happening all over again. I sort of enjoyed it. I don't know how many times that happened to me before it stopped. I grew to really like it. Though now I'm happy it stopped.

I've ever met anyone who could explain why that kept happening to me as a young child. So I just say, I never knew why."
"Driving Me Crazy","Michigan","Haunted Places","I moved in this house 11 years ago. The first experience I had was down in my tool room. 

I had just bought a $20 tin snip at Home Depot. I was about to hang it on one of the hooks, it slipped out of my hand and made the sound metal on concrete. I bent down to pick it up. It was gone. I tore everything apart in that room but nothing was found. This occurred about 3 years ago. I still am having a hard time just thinking of this. I had family members search high and low, but to no avail. 

Many things have disappeared. The latest happened two weeks ago. I was sitting at my computer, laid my eye glasses down, went into the other room and came back a few minutes later. My glasses were gone. I have yet to get them back. Again everyone in the household said, ""Oh, you must have misplaced them."" I said, ""No, I laid them right on this table."" They continued searching and I told them to save their energy because I knew they wouldn't find it. 

A couple of years back I had laid something small on the bed. I turned my back for a minute and then turned around. It was gone but I remembered being dazed. Talking to myself, did I or didn't I lay something on the bed. Then I came to the conclusion that I did lay it on the bed. I can't remember what it was but I do remember it was something insignificant but to me something happened that was significant. 

More little objects disappearing but only when it wants to steal from me. I have no idea why they are just taking my things and no else's. It stays in my mind all the time wondering what item of mine will be the next. 

I know there are a lot of opinions from people on this site and I would welcome any thoughts."
"Haunted House, Sleep Paralysis, Shadow People","Ohio","A Haunted Life","I remember being on this website when I was in middle school. I started to write a post back then but I didn't know if anyone would take me seriously because I was young. I am 19 now and recently have had more things happen so I thought it was a good time to write this. I will try to sum it up as best as I can. 

My parents got a divorce when I was going into fourth grade so we (my mom and two sisters - I am a triplet) move into a different house and change schools. 

In middle school I slept over a friends who said her house was haunted by two young kids and an older man (her family did research on the history of the house). I remember feeling very on edge when I was there. I thought it was just my mind overreacting. Ever since then, when I came back to my house I felt the same sense of being watched. 

At first it was footsteps (I thought I was crazy). I saw a brush float in the air then drop in my bedroom, cup move on desk while I'm sitting there. There were certain things that didn't scare me. Other times I would be overwhelmed with a sense of fear, I couldn't breathe. It happened mostly in my bathroom but I could sense it randomly all over the house. I couldn't talk to anyone about this because I wasn't close with my family and everyone was going through a hard time. 

I used to hear mumbled voices at night. I made myself think it was my sisters late at night being annoying talking to each other from their own room across the hall. It doesn't even make sense as to why they would do that but I vividly remember a few nights where I would yell their names and tell them to be quiet. 

About a year after we all moved out, beginning of high school, I told my mom and one of my sisters at dinner about my experiences and when I got to the part about hearing the voices, my sister said she heard it too and would yell at me and our other sister to be quiet. My mom said she remembers us yelling at each other to be quiet. My mom's room was in the basement. Me and my sisters had our own rooms all upstairs on the same level, close to each other. I don't understand how we never heard each other yell to be quiet.

My mom got cancer when I was in seventh grade. She is okay now - thank God. I was scared every night. I've heard three knocks on my bathroom door while I was showering and when I got out to see who was there I saw my family was all watching TV downstairs. I even came downstairs in a towel to ask who knocked. 

When I lived in that house I grew a very, very, very intense fear of the noise the water the bathtub made when I turned it on. I can't even describe it. It was like the noise was a trigger of the fear. 

One of the scariest feelings I ever felt was when I was about to fall asleep one night and started to smell bonfire smoke. I looked outside but no fires. It was way too strong for it to come from outside anyways, especially with my windows being shut. The fear that came over my entire body while I was smelling it was awful. I hid under my covers, sweating, until I fell asleep. 

One time I ran into the laundry room and my eyes were looking down, as I stepped into the room I saw shadowy feet about two feet in front of me and I looked up and saw a very tall shadowy figure (male) - I ran. No details on the figure. Just a shadow that wasn't on the wall. I don't even remember what I did after I saw that. My insomnia started back then and I am still very scared of the dark. I have an overwhelming fear of it and I am 19. 

These are just the main events that stick out. I have had a few friends that had experiences in the old house. 

Within the last month I started dating a guy who is the most amazing, spiritual, respectful person I have ever met. He knows I lived in a ""haunted house"" and that I don't like talking about it because I still get scared thinking about it. He never has asked questions. 

Two nights ago I came to his house to sleepover. I was already stressed out just from day to day life but I didn't talk about how I felt. (I have struggled with depression and anxiety since my parents got a divorce). We fell asleep early, around 11 pm. 

I had a dream that my family and friends were all staying at a beach house. In the dream I knew I wasn't myself. It felt odd. I was just someone's perspective going through a hallway and turned right into a bedroom and saw one of my sisters on her bed looking down at her phone. She didn't look up - as if she didn't know anyone was there. That was the end of the dream and I ""wake up"" in sleep paralysis. (I told this sister about all of this and she doesn't think any of it is real.) 

I know I am in sleep paralysis because I experienced it when I was 4 years old and later on in life realized what happened because I saw something online. I researched about it and heard of these shadow people that can manifest in sleep paralysis. 

Anyways, I wake up in sleep paralysis but I am not in my boyfriend's room. I am in the beach house bedroom where me and my boyfriend are sleeping. I can physically feel my leg still under his. I can't move to see him though. My eyes are faced towards a lit up door and a shadow figure quickly comes in. At first it is the size of the door but as it comes into the corner of the room, it rises to the height of the ceiling. 

At the same time it rises, I hear an intense loud white noise in my ear and a very high pitched ringing sound. The same time the shadow grew and the sound started, my eyesight also started glitching. It was as if a computer program was messing up and glitching out. But this was in my head. The noise was coming from in my head. In my ears. I shut my eyes and I know what is going on because I have read about it. I still am panicking and start trying to flail my body around to wake up my boyfriend and he will know I am having a nightmare. 

As I think I am about to wake him up, I hear the sink running in the bathroom and I think to myself ""He is in the bathroom! He is not going to be able to help me!"" and as that thought ended I woke up from sleep paralysis next to my boyfriend asleep with my leg under his. I still heard a loud sound in my ear, as if I just sat next to a helicopter or something. 

I woke him up because I was so scared. I told him I just had the worst sleep paralysis and right before I even told him what happened he said ""What? I think I had sleep paralysis?"" I asked what he meant but he quickly shrugged it off and said never mind. 

About twenty minutes later I calm down a little bit and I realize I am naked. I woke up with my clothes off. Even my boyfriend said he remembers me having clothes on going to bed. I have woken up naked before when I know I had a clothes on when I fell asleep. I never thought anything of it until now. I am not sure what to think. 

I was very shook up the rest of the day. I even screamed when a loud truck drove past my car. My boyfriend could see how much this hurt me and made an appointment for that day to go to a crystal healer. 

On our way there he told me that last night at 4 am (two hours before I woke up with sleep paralysis) he woke up and noticed he peed his pants. He was embarrassed to tell me. I think he is scared. I can see in his eyes he sometimes believes me but he also doesn't want to think it is real. I don't know how much he believes me. This is hurting our relationship. 

I told my mom and she knows I wouldn't make this up. I feel a little better after meeting with the lady at the apothecary but I still am on edge. 

I have seen two white orbs before so I know there is something always protecting me. One when I was 4 and another within the last six months.

"Noises And Unexplained Happenings In Old Victorian: Year 1","Massachusetts","Haunted Places","For three years, I rented different rooms in an old Victorian home in suburban Massachusetts, built in 1890. Due to changing roommate circumstances, and the fact that the house was split up by floor for different family sizes and the two units were separated from one another, I was required to move each time as leases changed. Much changed about my home life as people came and went, but there was one constant: I was always experiencing some creepy, unexplained circumstance in that house. Not a moment went by where everything just made sense and could be logically explained. 

A brief description of the home: it is a Queen Anne Victorian, with gingerbread-like shingles and trim all the way around, painted beige. There are pointed gables on both sides of the house, and it is three floors including the attic. There is a small winding driveway that circles the house. There are two front doors, the downstairs one opening into to a small closet connected to what is now a downstairs bedroom on the lefthand side by way of a door, and the other front door opens to a staircase leading upstairs, which stops at a landing three quarters of the way up, to turn leftward into a small upstairs hallway. There was a wall separating the staircase from the closet, thereby separating the two units. There is a second staircase accessed from a door on the back side of the house which leads up to the kitchen on the second floor, and a side door on the opposite back side of the house leading to the downstairs kitchen. The middle of the downstairs consisted of a large living room.

The first room in the house that I rented was on the first floor, connected to the living room. There was a door in the corner of my room leading to a closet, which could also be accessed from the living room. I found it very strange that the closet could be accessed both from the living room and from my bedroom, and I realized it did not look much like a closet at all. There was a small window in the closet and it was located directly under the stairs, behind the closet accessed when walking in through the front door and separated from it by a wall. 

The first night I slept in the house, I felt as if I was being watched from that ""closet."" I could not see anything in the dark, but I expected to see creepy eyes staring at me, watching me lying in bed. I also felt very exposed, because if there was ever an intruder, there were many ways they could access my room. I got up in the middle of the night to shut that door, and I checked to make sure the window in the closet was locked. To my relief, it was firmly locked. I was lying in bed when I begun to hear a noise that would plague me for weeks: a quiet, but high-pitched ""beep."" This sound occurred once every three minutes. It resembled the sound a smoke detector makes when its battery is dying, and this is what I assumed was making the noise. I eventually managed to fall asleep, as it was not the one in my room that was making the noise and it was far enough away to not keep me awake. At this point, the sound was only a minor annoyance. 

The next morning, I walked to each smoke detector downstairs, trying to see which one was making the noise. None of them were chirping, but I could still hear the beep. I could not tell whether it was coming from above or below, but instinctually when I heard it, I looked upward. I went to each room, but no matter where I went, it sounded as if it was coming from somewhere else. If I stood in the kitchen, it sounded like it was coming from the living room. If I stood in the living room, it sounded as if it was coming from the kitchen. I checked every appliance that could possibly be making the sound. It wasn't the dishwasher. It wasn't the washer or the dryer. The noise was a mystery. I checked the basement, but it was not coming from there and could barely be heard while down there. Finally, I got the courage to knock on the upstairs tenants' front door, asking them if they could hear the sound. Not only could they not hear it, but they assumed I was crazy because if it was loud enough to be that noticeable, they were in disbelief they could not hear it too. At this point I felt chills down my spine: if it wasn't coming from the basement and it wasn't coming from the upstairs, it was coming from somewhere in my immediate living space, and I was still unable to identify it. 

Eventually, my roommate, who had lived in the house for a full year before I moved in, remarked that she had, too, heard the noise in the past from time to time but never for days on end, and that guests of hers had inquired about what it was. No one ever had an answer and they never thought much of it, and eventually my roommate had adjusted to the sound and barely noticed it. Two weeks later, at 3:00 AM, the noise suddenly stopped. I never heard it again. To this day I am perplexed and wonder what could have been making that sound. Eventually, I forgot about the sound and decided to move on.

About two weeks later, around 1 in the morning, I woke up to the sound of pacing up and down the front staircase and across the upstairs landing, which woke me up due to the heavy thudding sound. I could hear it distinctly, as my room was located directly beneath. The sound began at the top of the stairs, and made its way down. I assumed that it was one of the upstairs tenants going outside for a cigarette, but I was proven wrong when I did not hear the front door open. About ten seconds after the footsteps reached the bottom of the stairs, they climbed back up, paced around the landing, and then came back down. I wondered, why would someone be pacing up and down the stairs? This continued for about half an hour, and it kept me awake. The next morning, I knocked on the front door of the upstairs unit (which, ironically, opened to the staircase I heard the footsteps on) and demanded to know who was making such a racket. I was unsettled to find out that there was only one tenant home that night and that they did not get home until 2 in the morning from a party. The upstairs was empty at 1 AM.

Every now and again, I would hear, around the same time, what sounded like a ball rolling down those stairs and hitting the front door. My roommate heard it as well, but the upstairs tenants claimed they could not hear it. My roommate assumed they were drunk and rolling items down the stairs for fun, but I thought differently. 

Over the next several months, I could not sleep well because I felt as if there was someone, or something, staring at me from outside the house. My room jutted out of the side of the house, part of one of the gables, so my bed was surrounded by windows on three sides. Out of the window to my left, I could see the side of the house and the outside of the window looking into the closet. I eventually put curtains on each of these windows, and the feeling of being watched subsided. When I began using this closet to store my clothes and suitcases, I noticed the window in the closet was unlocked. I asked my roommate if she had unlocked it: she had not. I DISTINCTLY remembered checking to make sure it was locked the first night I stayed in the house. I came to find that if I left the window locked, I would find it unlocked within the next day or two. I eventually got so creeped out that I removed all my belongings from the closet, put my dresser in front of the door connecting the closet to my room, and placed a table against the door connecting the closet to the living room. 

Not long after, I woke up to the sound of footsteps toward the front of the house: slow, heavy footsteps that clearly belonged to a man in boots. They sounded as if they began at the front door, and ended at the door I had blocked off between my room and the closet. It was impossible, however, for anyone to make this entire trip, for there was a wall separating the two closets. I heard this happen three times, always in the early hours of the morning while it was still dark outside. Each time, I froze in place, put the covers over my head, and sat as still as I could until the footsteps stopped. I would later find out that before the separating wall was built between the front staircase and the downstairs, that both of these ""closets"" had once formed a continuous hallway from the front door to the living room and to my room, once a dining room.

Occasionally during the day, I heard very similar footsteps from the upstairs down the back staircase, but they did not stop at the door leading to the outside, but right behind my refrigerator in the kitchen. Shortly after they stopped, I would hear what sounded like a doorknob turning. There was no door behind the refrigerator to even open, and there was no place opposite that wall to stand to even open a door had there been one. I vaguely remember my landlord stating that the back staircase once faced the opposite direction and led to the downstairs kitchen, but this was changed in the 1950s when the house's partitions were formed to make the home for two families. 

I am not religious, but I prayed to whichever higher power may exist to allow these strange occurrences to cease. I had reached my limit. 

From December of that year until my lease ended in May, most occurrences were minor. Items would disappear and turn up in other rooms. Doors I had distinctly remembered leaving open would be shut when I returned to the room. The living room overhead light, which could be turned on via a handheld clicker, would not work because the wall switch, which must be in upward position for the clicker to work, would be found in downward position, but neither myself nor my roommate flicked the switch down. 

At this point, my roommate began to think I was going mad. She still believed there is a logical explanation for each of these events. However, this would change one night.

It was a Friday night in May, the last week of the lease. The upstairs tenants were throwing a wild party: music blasting, feet stomping, and the front door opening and shutting as new guests arrived. Suddenly, I heard a knock on my door. I went to the door, assuming that it was a guest for the party upstairs who had mistakenly knocked on the wrong door. I opened the door to see a pale-faced boy around my age standing there, asking where his brother was in a deep, dazed voice. I still assumed he meant to knock on the other door, and assumed his brother was a party guest. I began to tell him that the door to the upstairs was the next one, but he shoved past me and into my apartment, stating that his brother lived in my apartment and that I was ""hiding"" him. He ran through my roommate's room, through the living room and into the kitchen. I ran after him, demanding an explanation, shaken up and grabbing my pepper spray from my bag and my phone to begin dialing 9-11. 

When I reached the kitchen, there was no one there. 

I ran outside, to my car, locked the car doors and dialed the police, explaining that there was an intruder hiding somewhere in my house. When the police showed up, they searched every possible space in the apartment. They even checked the blocked off closet, but he could not have been in there, because the furniture I had placed in front of the doors was undisturbed, and it would have been impossible to reposition it from inside the closet. There was no one to be found anywhere in the apartment. They assumed that he had run out of the house when he heard the police sirens, but this could not have been possible. From my car I would have seen him exit through either of the doors, and the police found that all but one of the windows were locked.

All of the windows except the one in the closet."
"Military Men Of The Queen Mary","California","Haunted Places","My name is George, and this so happens to be my first time writing/telling my story to the public in any fashion outside of family members and close friends. I have nothing to hide so feel free to ask any questions you may have after reading this. My experience takes place aboard The Queen Mary in Long Beach California. I was about 20 years old at the time if I recall correctly. Can't remember what year it was exactly but I know I had a myspace account at the time. The woman (A fellow coworker and friend) I went with posted a few pics from that day. I didn't take any of those pics except for maybe 1 or 2, and at that time I didn't really know how myspace worked so she posted the pictures for me onto my account. Visit it to see for yourself. Www.myspace.com/George1287.

 Some of the pictures may seem a bit questionable I know. I'll even admit to that myself, but I promise you if these pictures were victim of foul play I had no knowledge or hand in its doing. I have nothing to gain or earn from them. So say what you will of them but know I didn't notice anything until she called me to tell me what she found on the pictures as she was uploading them for me. The pictures were taken on a digital camera. I think it was a Nikon or one of those big brand named cameras. Now as you can see upon viewing the pictures we were not ghost hunting. It was just a simple visit. It was somewhat of a date. As you notice in most of the pictures I'm always in some weird smiling pose as is she. Most ghost hunters that I know of from TV don't normally do that. I myself am no ghost hunter. Just want to make that as clear as possible. I believe in them and don't want them to be following me or any of that type stuff.

 Now that being said, aside from those pictures on my Myspace account I mentioned earlier, I want to tell you the one and only experience or time I felt like I may have witnessed something possibly paranormal. I say possibly because I'm still not sure what I actually encountered or saw. Well I know what I saw I'm just not 100 percent sure as to if what I saw was paranormal or not. Throughout that day I never really noticed anything strange or got any kind of weird creepy feelings except for 1 moment. For those of you who do not know, the Queen Mary offers self guided tours of parts of the ship. In 1 location on the tour is this viewing area. In this spot you can literally look over a rail into the ocean water below and see the ships propeller. Well it's in this area that I felt very uneasy upon what it was I had seen. The bizarre thing is what I saw shouldn't have made me feel so creeped out and uneasy. However here goes nothing. I happened to be walking past 1 of the entry ways to view the propeller below. There are 2 entry ways to go in and see the view. Kinda in the shape of a reverse letter C. There's no doors, or security. Its essentially just part of the tour where you can wander around. So as I'm walking down the hallway of the tour I pass by one of the entry ways. Now as you walk by and pass either entry way the most likely thing your going to see at a glance is either the rail or random people looking over the rail to see the propeller down below. Well for some reason, I still can't explain to myself why but I looked to see what I could see. Sorta just being nosey. That sorta thing. What I saw was 2 men dressed in military attire. The 1st being an older gentleman wearing an all white suit. Seemed like a man of authority or high ranking officer with a hat. The other man standing right beside him was younger and looked of a lower ranking due to his uniform being brownish green can't be to sure. He too was also wearing a hat. The men were standing and looking at something in the younger ranking officers hands. Didn't seem like a phone or tablet of any kind. Seemed like what could of been a piece of paper of some kind I think. Now I have military members in my family and I pay my respects to all men and women in the service of our country. So when I see them I like to shake their hands and say thank you. 

Not at any moment upon just viewing men or women in uniform at a distance do I become uneasy or get weird vibes. In fact the opposite happens. I become grateful and feel very proud. But not this time. When I saw these 2 military men from a glance at a distance I got this very unsettling and creeped out feeling. What made it worse was upon me seeing them and actually acknowledging that they were military, both men at the exact same time looked up and made direct eye contact with me as I passed through the entryway's line of sight. It was one of those moments where I wasn't going to stop to go in. I just wanted to look in to see what I could see. I was still walking down the hallway of the tour at the time. My body was still in walking motion, all I did was just turn my head to the left to see if I could see anything. Sure enough I did. That was the only time I ever felt that eerie and creeped out and uneasy while on that ship. And if you viewed the pictures you'll notice that some of the pictures we took, I was in certain locations I shouldn't have been in. Not once did I feel anything like that during the tour except for this instance when I saw the 2 men standing there making eye contact with me. Till this day that is my dilemma. I have no clue if they were actually living breathing military men on break or if they were perhaps dare I say ghosts. Thank you for taking the time to read."
"Bandana Of A Thing","Missouri","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","While sitting in the kitchen, eating Steak and Shake, I look up to see 2 bandanas that are tied to the pantry cabinet doors blowing like wind is moving them up from an undercurrent. My husband is around the corner where he can't see this happening, blowing his nose. I figure it's the a.c. Or wind somehow doing this. I am waiting for him to come around the corner to see it so he can explain to me how or why those blue bandanas are moving like that. As soon as he walks around the corner, they stop. I tell him about what I just saw and asked him to just sit down and watch them awhile. He's walking and moving so I figured if it was his movement somehow causing it, it would also do this again. If it happened once, it would happen again, right? Wrong. They didn't move again the rest of the night. We sat 30 minutes. We checked later. Nothing else happened.

These bandanas have been hung on those pantry door handles for 6 months and I have never seen them move like that. We've had heat on in the winter and a.c. On when it is hot. I have sat in that kitchen many times and those bandanas have never moved. Ever. They moved today while I was watching them but as soon as my husband came around the corner - the movement stopped and did not continue. 

Several nights ago I was woken up to a woman's voice saying ""hush"" loudly. It woke up me and my children. My husband was asleep and no one else is in our house. Perhaps we just have bad insulation and sound carried from outside somehow? Only this has happened before and the same voice then said it was going to wear our skins (woke me and the kids up that time too). Strange things are going on in my home.

Three days prior to this, I was woke up to what sounded like screaming in the distance around 2 a.m. I couldn't see my clock because my water cup was in the way but my hubby gets up for work around 2:30 a.m. And he was still asleep. He got up about a half hour later hence I know it was around 2 a.m. When I saw a face with one eye and shaggy hair peeking at me through an exercise bike near our bed. It scared me. Everyone was in bed asleep but me. I prayed then got up and checked. Kids were sound asleep. I had the hubby move the exercise bike out.

The next night I woke up feeling like I was being choked at around 2 a.m. I sat up (I could move - I was not paralyzed) and found my neck hurt. When I went to look in the mirror later I found out that my neck was bloody where my cross necklace sits on my neck like something had been scratching at my neck. I don't have fingernails (I chew mine) and my chain and cross are smooth. There is nothing in my bed that can scratch my neck and my husband has clipped fingernails plus he was laying on the other side of the bed. He did not have anything on that could scratch me. While this was happening though, I'm scared and look at the wall (I'm laying on the side near the wall). I suddenly see a black golf ball size round shadow on the wall moving up the wall slowly then disappeared. 

Last night, I woke up again around 2 a.m. To the feeling of being choked. I open my eyes and see a shadow on the wall above my sleeping husband's head like jagged triangle hair (a girls hair). It then moves out above his head and disappears. I'm scared but exhausted so I wait a while and then try to lay back down to sleep. I lay back down and shortly after feel myself being ""choked"" again. I can move, I'm not paralyzed or anything so I sit up, freaking out, trying to swallow but struggling. It feels like something has its hands around my neck, squeezing me. As soon as I call on the name of Jesus Christ it stops. 

My husband saw the blood on my neck. I'm not crazy. My kids are being affected too and having nightmares. 

I'm in the process of obtaining some holy water to bless my home. The lady obtaining it for me had a daughter who broke her ankle the day after I asked for the item so I am hoping I will have this item soon (not wanting to push). I've said prayers throughout my house. I also bought some white sage. I think I'm being targeted by a demon. I've asked my husband to start video taping."
"Continuing Strange Events","Nebraska","Poltergeists / Physical Manifestations","If you read my previous story, 'Thieving Critters' you will know that fairly recently, I had an issue with at least 1, probably 2, entities in a hotel. I am very much afraid that whatever that/they were they followed me home. 

Y'all can probably guess I don't scare/spook or fuss easily about dead people visiting, but I do get annoyed. However, this has left behind 'annoyed' and gotten into something bordering scary.

To be clear, I am comfortable with salting, smudging, fuming, and working with candles for purification. I use those things as a last resort, because I believe in letting people be as long as they do not cause harm, distress, or anything else negative to their hostess. I have used them and they have failed in this instance. For me to reach the point of calling out to everyone here for help should tell you how unsettled this has me.

Not long, maybe 2 days after the incident at the hotel, I began to hear heavy, booted, crunching footsteps in the room above mine at night. They are not every night, but at every second or third day. With those sounds are men's voices; voices that are very similar to the voices from my hotel experience. 

My dogs, a Basset and a Boxer, stare up at the ceiling and whimper, and do not move from my side. I go upstairs, and the noise continues until I get to just outside the room - then nothing. 

My adult son, who sleeps up on that floor, has said he hasn't heard anything, but he did say he's started having nightmares almost every night. He doesn't remember what they are about, but he wakes terrified and can't get back to sleep. Understand, he does not believe in the paranormal, and he is very pragmatic. I can count the number of times he's talked about a nightmare on one hand in his entire life, and three times it's been this last week.

My husband has mentioned that his closet door keeps opening at night. Slamming open and staying open. It does wake me, and I run in to check on him. It is a sliding door and has never had an issue in the past. He has also had to look for his keys on several occasions, and found them in VERY unlikely places, like the ignition of a truck he hasn't driven in a week.

Several items are going missing around the house. On Sunday I purchased some rather expensive Chinese Sweet Tea leaves. Six ounces - cost $26.00. I distinctly and clearly recall putting them in my tea cabinet (I like tea so I devoted one of my cabinets to it) Sunday night. My son made some strawberry black, with the leaves, and remembers putting them back in the cabinet. Yesterday I went to get some and the leaves were gone, just... Gone.

The thing that aggravates me the most though, is my spice cabinet. I have a 'tool spice' cabinet and a 'cooking' spice cabinet. There is some cross over but I don't mix them. After I fumed, using an incense briquette, cinnamon sticks and cloves, I went to bed, rather exhausted. When I got up this morning all of my spices in my cooking cabinet were tossed around in their little cabinet like a cyclone tore through them. My cumin (hand toasted and ground) spilled all over the place.

I have reached my wits end with this. I am pleading with y'all. Does anyone know what else I can do? I've tried talking, smudging, prayer, candles, salting, and fuming. None has worked.

Okay, in the interest of complete disclosure, I had another thought. My MIL is having some very trying times with her health, and in fact may pass very soon. This is affecting my husband's emotional balance. How possible/likely is it, that with my husband's damaged brain, broken neural pathways, and other issues (crushing head injury 2009) that he could be 'poltergeisting' his stress and worries and they are causing this in the way some teens do? That would certainly explain why none of my tried and true methods are working.

Please, any advice or help, even if it seems outrageous, is welcome."
"Pdx Punk Scene","Oregon","Haunted Places","When I was young and scrappy, I lived in a lovely, large home in North Portland's historically ""redlined"" Dekum neighborhood. I have no clue when the home was built, or who lived there before I shared the house in the early 2000's. 

All six-eight housemates were artists or activists of some sort, and there were usually lots of people in and out of our place. The other roomies had lived there a couple of years before me. Now the whole neighborhood is gentrified beyond recognition. This home has been fixed up very posh, as well, but I am sure the backyard will always be full of bottle tops.

We often had travelers overnight, and hosted rock shows in our basement. It was mostly good fun, if crowded and noisy sometimes. Everyone was welcome. In fact, I am not sure if I ever had or needed a key. The housemates joked about a ghost which had said hello once, but I figured that they were fronting to prove who was toughest. I also felt that there was often enough partying involved to count on anyone having clearly recalled or experienced anything. Our many cats would fixate on walls, or seem to avoid a certain stairway, but cats are weird, so-meh. I had no incidents or issues, of my own, directly.

My friend ""Max"" came over one festive Rosh Hosana. We spent most of the evening downstairs, in my room, splitting a bottle with another pal. Although his Marine Corps training usually came through, Max was wobbling as he tried to get out the front door. So the friend and I decided to stagger several blocks to his home, one on each side. As I lifted up his arm over my shoulder, he looked at me all drunk and serious, and said ""Who is the kid on the stairs, staring, with the curly hair?"" 

I looked and said, ""No one is there now."" The house was full of people I did not know, dancing and celebrating, so it could have been anyone.

Max sighed and said all matter-of-fact ""I mean the ghost. The ghost of the kid, right there, staring."" That night was one for the drunken fool record books so I dismissed what he said. In normal daylight, sober, he does not talk about ""silly things"" like ghosts, or answer my questions if he remembers. 

When my biggest, toughest brother was 17 he came to visit. One day while I was at work he saw the cats ""acting funny like a ghost came into the living room."" Any hint of which I had specifically not mentioned to him, as he was himself a fraidycat and very likely not to visit. So I was not sure what to give his ""cat experience"" up to, although he at least was sober. I told him it was his imagination. I was never afraid or weirded out in that home, but afterward he refused to be alone there.

The house had three floors. The space I rented was one area of the basement. On principal, and as usual, when I moved in I ""claimed"" my little space and neutral intentions out loud. I also negotiated what I hoped was a truce with the enormous deadly spiders. ""Mikey"" had the opposite basement portion, and the larger open area was laundry and band staging for shows or practices. 

Mikey was a drummer and had some things there, but lots of bands came through to practice or perform, and each brought their own gear and instruments. This involved getting everything down the basement steps, so for big drums or speakers a couple people would have to help, even with a handcart, on the steps.

One average grey Friday afternoon, a noisy band of fashionable roughs arrived from out of town. They said their hellos and began moving instruments and gear downstairs to set up. I was in the living room on the main floor, sitting on the sofa. The familiar smell of rainy leather and loose tobacco filled the house. I went on about my sitting. Mikey and his friend, Nacho, were helping the band maneuver a very large, expensive speaker into place downstairs. 

Suddenly those six sturdy, armed, young punks came tripping and yelling over each other, running lickety split up the stairs like cartoons. One of them kept running right on out the front door. Nacho was just gibbering all wild-eyed. One dude (also fully tattooed, wearing spikes) kept saying ""I don't even care if we dropped it- I don't even effing care"" over and over. Mikey was actually bent with his hands on his knees, like he had run a race, glasses askew. They were all talking at once, freaked out, hands flapping like a church choir. It took a minute to sort what had actually happened. They had dropped the amp. Everyone had dashed pell mell upstairs, shouting and basically pissing themselves.

While downstairs, four of them were holding the largest speaker (which was off/unplugged) when all of them heard an amplified male voice come through it, saying calmly ""I just wanted you to know, you're not alone down here."""
"Possibly Friendly Entity And Others","Texas","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","Let's just get right into it. For the past few months I've had weird little things happen at night. I would be laying in bed, and slowly but surely I would start feeling a weight press onto my back and down onto the mattress, and then a pressure draped around my side. (I'm a side sleeper.) I would throw the blankets off of me as I would suddenly start feeling really hot. I made sure it hadn't just been a pillow that slid down behind me, and surely enough that was never the case. 

I would hear what sounded like a man breathing right behind my neck after holding my breath for a little bit because I felt the bed rising and falling slightly out of sync with my slower breathing. A lot of the time it sounded kind of labored, like they were having a hard time breathing. 

This would go on for a while until I felt like I needed to switch positions, so sometimes I would roll over onto my other side. The presence would go away for a second, and then come back behind me again. Other times I would be frustrated and move to the other end of the bed, then it would usually leave. 

I would feel very comfortable and loved during a majority of these times, but I'm an easily frustrated person and other times I grow irritated because I'm not that fond of being touched. 

This next bit is relevant to the story. Instead of heaters or central air, we have a big wood burning stove in our kitchen that we use during the winter to keep the house warm. I always sleep with my door closed, except for the winter when I want heat in, so I'll leave the door cracked open maybe 2/3 of the way. 

I have never sleep walked in my entire life, so anytime that I've gotten up in the middle of the night to do miscellaneous things like use the restroom down the hall or go to the kitchen for something, I've always been awake. 

Anyway, I would sleep soundly through the night, and when I would wake up, the door would be completely shut for no reason. I incessantly asked my family who had done it, and accused my siblings of closing my door at night. It was a quite annoying because my room would be absolutely freezing when I woke up. My family swore that no one did it, because why would they anyway? All of us kept our doors open for heat, so it didn't make sense for them to close only mine for whatever reason. 

This went on for a while longer, then stopped once it got a little warmer and we didn't have to use the furnace anymore, and I slept with my door closed again. A lot of the times I get hot but don't want to turn on my air conditioner, so instead I just take off my shirt and sleep without it with the fan blowing on me. I would feel out of nowhere like someone was running their finger down my back, my neck, or my cheek. Sometimes it would be light little touches all over me, but especially my back, hip and face. 

Now, the room didn't feel particularly cold or negative and I didn't feel unsafe, but I definitely felt like there was someone in the room with me. Usually after these occasions where I'd feel the touches I wouldn't wake up with marks, but one night last month I kept feeling it touch this one part of my back over and over again. It was next to my right shoulder blade, and then a couple inches below. When I was getting dressed that morning I saw 4 three or so centimeter long scratches in the same area I was feeling it touch me. They went away sometime throughout the morning. They weren't deep but right on the surface, and thin but not thin enough to be that of a cat or a dog. (I don't sleep with my pets in my room anyway.) 

A lot of those nights I would then have dreams of being with someone that I've never seen before, pretty much always with black hair, strange eye colors like red, bright green, bright pink, yellow, but mostly with the same general features. We would interact with each other in the dreams as I normally would with someone I'm friends with or someone I love. He's very tall in these dreams, maybe around 6½ feet or so. 

I have also heard whispering or soft male voices speaking at night, but that was pretty rare. I woke up at 1:30 in the morning a few months ago and heard two hushed voices of men conversing. It stopped as soon as I shot up from my bed being alert. I couldn't make out what they were saying as it was too quiet. To finish this off, I've only ever seen one of those things once, the other time my sister saw it. 

The layout of our house is like you walk down from the hallway, where my room is at, and at the end you take a left, and there's the kitchen. Right is to the lounge and the entry way. I had come back to tell my sister something, who was sitting near the very back of the kitchen at the table. From there, you can see down most of the hallway. She said that as I was walking back down the hall towards the kitchen, she saw the a slightly translucent black silhouette of a man run after me from out of my room, then disappear around the corner towards the entry way, where you can't see in. 

The other time I was yet again walking down the hallway when I saw a large, stocky opaque shadow leaning out from behind the trim of a bedroom at the very end of the hall. It quickly vanished when I looked at it. 

That sums up most of what's happened to me."
"The Wendigo","Wyoming","Non Human Entities","There is no easy way to tell the tale of facing a wendigo. I won't give my name away so my name will be Alex due to the severity of this story. Before you read on know one detrimental detail, this story is 100 percent true without over-exaggeration. So please without further wait, let's begin my horrifying yet eye-opening experience. 

On September 13th of 2016 I was driving up the Big Horn Mountains above Buffalo, Wyoming. Just like every trip, I packed accordingly: 2 bottles of water, 6 Nutrigrain Bars and my loaded handgun. I drove up 4 to 5 times per week never worrying on ghost stories or monsters. As far as I knew, these mountains were harmless besides predators seldomly seen and weather interference. 

But something in me changed on September 13th. Instead of going to my usual neck of the woods, I went to a remote camp site known as Hettinger, 15 miles up from town. It's a beautiful place where, if you cross the fence, you can climb to a peak and oversee for days. As I was looking over the majestic snow covered landscape, I saw a tall slender figure marching through the blanket of powder. 

Normally I would drop it as a hunter on the move but Hettinger was far from any known hunting locations. To this day I wish I would have packed up and left, I wish I didn't peek through my binoculars but sometimes securing curiosity is the only safe option. 

I'll never let myself forget the moment I peered through the cold glass over the winter plateau. As I focused my lenses and the figure came to clarity, I dropped behind the rocks. It was looking back at me... As if it could see me. That would be impossible for a human, I was 1,000 feet away or more hidden by a rock and within the tree line. 

I peeked back up, using only the top of my head to look again. It was just standing there sniffing the air looking at me. My heart sank and I couldn't move. I was frozen in fear. About 200 feet behind me was a small rock cave big enough to squeeze into and deep enough to hide in the dark. I slowly made my way, inching backwards. I took one last look and noticed it was sprinting towards me.

I moved as fast as possible to the hole and tucked in. The moment I made it, the creature was standing feet from where I was. Its skin was damp in appearance and gray. It also had long hands and fingers to match that turned to dagger-like nails. I cupped my mouth to hide my breathing which became a challenge due to the cold, but as I moved my hand a rock tumbled. I looked down at the rock just to look back up and see its cold eyes peering through the hole. 

It was almost as if it couldn't see me but it knew something was there. I stood still as a statue. It reached in, almost grasping my pack. After 5 minutes of forever, it gave up and took back to sniffing. I waited there in shock and a daunting weight of fright casting over me every moment in passing. 

It quickly got dark as night fell and it finally wondered off. I waited until I felt assured to poke my head out. I took a look around and saw nothing, not even a footprint. 

I took time in watching my steps to stay quiet and made my way back down to my car. I used my key to unlock it rather than using the button lock. I got in and sank down and took a last look around. I finally found courage to crank my car and began to drive down the trail to the main highway. As I was just about turned around I saw it... It stood as tall as the trees and stared at me. I hit the gas and fishedtailed but I made it. As I reached the main road it was in pursuit and was keeping up. After a few miles I looked back and it was gone. 

To this day I haven't been back, not even to that region of the mountains. Looking it up I found several myths about the creature and its origins, I believe you should to... It's quite unique. Stay safe and know the world is far more vast than we know."
"Grandmother Comes To The Rescue","South Carolina","Family / Friends Visits","I have never written anything on this site before, but I have always been interested in the paranormal and have read many of your stories. 

Anyway, my sister and I were out on a Saturday morning visiting the graves of our parents and grandmother. My grandmother is buried in a church cemetery way out in the country and very desolate. 

When we went into the Cemetery we opened the gate and did not close it back. We were standing at her grave when some very rowdy young men came by and saw us. They turned around and came back. At first they just sat and and were standing by the car drinking beer, laughing, and yelling inappropriate things to us. To say the least, my sister and I were very frightened and upset. My heart was beating so fast, I thought it was going to jump right out of my chest. 

After a few minutes they started towards the open gate and all of a sudden the gate slammed shut all by itself with no help from anyone. Those guys turned around, yelling profanity and left so fast it was comical. 

I'll always believe that it was my grandma looking out for us. There is no other reason for that gate to slam shut on its own. It was a beautiful day with no wind blowing. I believe she reached out from the grave and saved us from a dangerous encounter with those men. I felt her presence and things became very peaceful. She always loved and looked out for us when she was alive, and did the same from beyond. 

Anyway, if you read this any thoughts would certainly be appreciated. Later I will publish other encounters I have with what I believe to be paranormal experiences."
"My Brother's Trick","Oklahoma","Family / Friends Visits","This story took place in February 2018 in a suburb of Oklahoma City. My brother, ""John,"" had a stroke at the end of December, which left him unable to speak understandably. He had been a heavy smoker, which probably contributed to the stroke. I didn't visit him often before the stroke because I have asthma and had to avoid the cigarette smoke.

Following the stroke, John had pneumonia twice and no quality of life, being completely dependent upon the care of the staff of a nursing home. I was alone with him at the end in a hospital room. His breathing had been shallow and gaspy for a few hours, but painkillers and sedatives were keeping him comfortable. Then he sighed, and that was his last breath. I could see his pulse in his neck, and I watched as the heartbeat faded away. I talked to him, told him to fly to the light, and said many loved ones were waiting for him there.

A while later, other relatives arrived and learned that John had passed, and we comforted each other and dealt with the nurses, chaplain and doctor. Then I went to tell my elderly mother that John had died. We had been talking for a while when a niece called to say she was on her way to my mother's house. I had left my car in the middle of the double driveway, so I went out to move it and make room for my niece's car.

Right after I got in my car, I smelled cigarette smoke - John's kind of cigarette smoke. As I moved my car, I said, ""John, what are you doing out here in my car all by yourself?"" After I parked and opened the car door, I said, ""Well, you might as well come inside with me and see Mom!"" I imagined him snickering at the joke he had played on me and following me into the house, walking with his distinctive gait. When I saw my mom, I said, ""I just had a visit from John."" In my mind's eye he was so happy and free that it was a comforting experience. When I left a few minutes later to go home, my car had no smell of smoke in it."
"Random Sounds","California","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","I was inspired and brought to nostalgia by a comment I read on a story by another member. It made me reflect and rethink on the house that I lived in growing up with my parents... I thought, hey maybe all these little things are something? Maybe not. 

I mentioned before that I have heard experiences from my mother, both of my brothers and my sister. Never from my father. He doesn't like to give that kind of thing thought or energy (he did once tell me a Ouija board story so I know he believes). I've had my share of ""experiences"" that until now I didn't really consider an ""experience"" because they have never been to the same extent as my other family members.

I'm not saying these are paranormal experiences but I am saying some of these experiences are just inexplicable to me. Here are little bits of unexplained sounds and I'll try to make it too long. 

This is from my mother.

When we first moved into this home the house was all white and all the flooring was rug. I remember being without furniture for some time. Anyway, my mother says one night she lay on her mattress. She said her balcony window was open. She said she heard a woman cry and that it swept through the room and out the door. Really loud and and getting lower as it faded through the home.

My mother, in present moment, is an empath. I have noticed there are times I or my sister have been extremely sad or upset and she always calls me at the time or the next day asking me if I am alright. That she dreamed of me very sad or in peril. I always wonder if maybe it has to do with that maybe with someone else, like her sisters? 

Throughout the years the house was renovated. The upstairs was floored with wood and downstairs was floored with tile. Yes, we heard the creaks and cracks and all the natural noises a house makes. But for me this was different. 

My mother and I always had a struggle. At night she wanted me in bed. However, I wanted to be downstairs watching TV or in the computer room playing my online games. 

My mother was the kind of mother to wake up and check on us a couple times during the night every night. My mom has such gentle feet sometimes she'd scare the living day lights out of me, catching me breaking her rules late at night. 

Eventually I learned that if I listened carefully enough I could always hear her coming off her bed for it creaked, and that would be my cue to lay on the couch and pretend to be sleeping. 

One night I heard the little creaks the bed makes when she's coming off of it. I thought ""Here she comes."" I very gently laid on the couch. It's leather and makes such terrible noise when sitting up or down or just adjusting position. I close my eyes. I hear bam bam bam bam bam. As if she were running down the stairs, hard and fast. 

I became frightened for the reason being that this would be the second time she'd told me to go to sleep on this particular night. I thought, ""Oh man, she is pissed."" 

I closed my eyes and pretended to sleep. Usually if she saw me ""asleep"" she'd gently wake me up and usher me to my room. That didn't happen. I got up, walked to the stairs and just stared up the two flights. I could see the light from her TV (she usually fell asleep to the TV on mute). But no noise. I crept up stairs and she was still asleep in bed. I was confused yet very relieved that she wasn't actually awake.

Mom would always say though that the wood echos sounds or makes sounds so I chalked up the bams to that. Although I had never before and never again heard it the way I did that night. 

I was a bit apprehensive of going back downstairs. Instead this time I went into the computer room. I figure I'd close the door and felt safe. I stayed up playing games for a few hours. 

Something happened, something strange, something that's also never happened to me since, and that I just can't explain. The room grew increasingly warmer and warmer. Yea, not cold! Just really, really warm. I thought it odd, we didn't have the ac or heater at this time. It felt pretty stuffy and eventually I opened the door. Still fairly warm. I remember walking out of the room and the house felt normal. 

Being game obsessed, I sat back down and got to it. Then I heard the ceiling starting to crackle and sort of pop. It was almost as if there was a fire! Like a domino effect through the whole ceiling in this small room crackle and pops. This freaked me out.

I bolted upstairs where there was no warmth or crackling anywhere to be felt or heard. I went into my mom's room and I fell asleep on her couch that night. For the sake of this not being too long and boring I have another peace with random sounds. Hope you enjoyed."
"A Comforting Nurse","Georgia","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","When I was about twenty years old my grandpa became very sick. He had a lung disease and it was taking its toll very quickly. 

He was at home when suddenly he passed out. His breathing was raspy and short so my grandma called an ambulance. He was taken to the closest hospital, only to be sent to a hospital in Atlanta, Georgia called Erlanger. They said that his lungs were filling with fluid and they were going to put in a tube to try and drain it but that, essentially, he would not be making it much longer. Two days go by and still no improvement. 

As soon as I got the call, I booked it to Atlanta to be with him and my family. My grandpa and I have always been super close. He had always understood me and been there for me in ways that most people could only wish for. Nothing was keeping me from being there for him. 

After about a three hour drive I made it, but they were already telling us there was no real hope and to call anybody who wanted to say goodbye. I sat with my grandpa for hours, talking to him like I always did. 

Even though he was tubed and in a medicated coma, I knew him well enough to know he wouldn't want me to treat him differently, so I told him about my crazy drive there and about some funny customers I had on my latest shift. I described the beautiful sunset I could see from his window and encouraged him to open his eyes and see for himself but, of course, I knew he wouldn't. 

Mostly I told him how much I loved him, and reminisced about our backyard camping trips, how he always came to my chorus concerts when I was in school and promised him that I would always remember his biggest lesson: ""Never let your fears stop you from chasing your dreams."" 

An announcement came over the intercom saying all visitors had to leave for the night. So I kissed him on the cheek and hugged my grandma, letting her know that if she needed anything to call me, that I wasn't leaving Atlanta in case things got worse. 

After grabbing a quick bite with my Mom and brother before they left for home, I drove around looking for a cheap but decent hotel in the area but there was nothing that I could really afford. So I drove back to the hospital and decided to just sleep in my car in the parking lot. Not exactly the safest or greatest idea I ever had but I didn't want to leave seeing that I lived so far away and didn't want to be far.

I made sure all my doors and windows were locked, curled up under my jacket best I could in the backseat and just cried. I didn't want to lose him but I knew there was nothing I could do. 

Physically and mentally drained, I started to drift into a restless sleep when I felt long fingers run through my hair. I sat straight up but saw no one. 

The smell of cheap perfume filled my car and I heard the voice of a woman say ""Hush, he will pass peacefully. I will see to it. Sleep. I will watch over you."" In that moment complete peace swept over me and I drifted back to sleep. 

An hour or so later my phone rang it was my grandma letting me know that he was getting worse and that I needed to call my family and tell them that they were turning all the machines off that morning. I told her I loved her and that I would. 

After everyone arrived we all stood around his bedside in prayer, hoping for a miracle, when I once again smelled the cheap perfume and felt a hand between my shoulder blades. I knew it was the mystery woman from that night because the only thing behind me was his IV pole. 

I quickly turned my head and momentarily saw a woman that looked to be in her late thirties in dark grey scrubs with brown wavy hair smiling at me. As soon as they removed the tubes and turned off the machine, I watched her walk over to my grandpa laying a single hand on his chest. Within minutes he was gone and as soon as the heart monitor screeched letting us know he was gone, she vanished. Personally, I think that she is a nurse that used to work there. 

I never asked anyone because I thought it would be rude but all in all, it was a strange but comforting experience."
"The Kid In My Basement","Missouri","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","The house that I live in now with my family has an unfinished basement. This is the first house we've ever lived in that had a basement because they were not common in homes in the little town in New Mexico where we are originally from. This basement has always been creepy to me. Most likely because having a basement was a new thing for me and because it wasn't too cozy or home like. 

Our laundry room is in the basement. I'm never too thrilled to go down there but hey, the laundry isn't going to do itself. My two youngest children are ages 10 and 6. They can be pranksters with each other, their teenage siblings and me and my husband. Sometimes, before we would enter a room, they would scurry off to find a hiding spot, say behind the couch, and we would play along acting as if we didn't see them saying ""Hmmm Where's Devin? I could have sworn I just heard him. Where could he be?"" And he or both of them would pop out laughing. They've done this in the basement a time or two while we'd be down there clearing out boxes and items in preparation of finishing the space.

I was taking the clothes out of the dryer and began putting the newly  washed clothes in. From the corner of my eye I saw what looked like one of my younger children playfully leap off of the last step of the staircase and scurry around the corner in to the open/den area of our basement. It happened so fast but it was clear enough to make me believe that one of my kids was up to their games. I wasn't necessarily in a playful mood and I just felt a little...odd. I yelled, ""Well here, come help me with this."" I didn't hear anything and I didn't want to look around the corner to check so, instead, I rushed upstairs with my laundry basket to find every member of my immediate family upstairs in the kitchen. 

Since then, I will not go down there by myself. I haven't told my children about what I saw. I don't want to freak them out."
"The Cat Who Jumps On My Bed At Night","Oklahoma","Family / Friends Visits","This is the first story I have submitted here. It takes place in three cities: Norman, Oklahoma; Lexington, Kentucky; and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. It begins in the 1990s and continues to the present.

I had a cat named Moonshadow, a silver Persian who was just gorgeous. He was the most dog-like cat I've ever had - very sociable, laid-back and quite bonded with me. He wasn't afraid of coming into a room full of guests to my home. I used to joke that he would stroll in, sit down in the middle of the room and look around casually, as if he had been smoking a joint in the next room. Moonshadow would sleep on my bed, but mainly he would wait until I turned off the light. He would jump up lightly, and I would feel him walk on the bed and lie down. 

I was living in Norman when I came home one day and found that Moonshadow was walking funny, as if his front legs and his hind legs weren't coordinated. I took him to the vet, who gave him a shot of steroids. The vet said if it was a disk problem, the steroids would help within two hours, but it probably was a tumor. The cat was more than 13 years old, and the vet said these purebred cats tend to get inbred and are susceptible to cancer. 

By the next morning, Moonshadow couldn't walk at all. I took him to the vet, who X-rayed but couldn't find a tumor. The next option was exploratory surgery, but I said no, it's time to let him go. I wept as he was put to sleep, and I buried him on a relative's land in the country.

A few nights later, after turning off the light at bedtime, I felt that soft pounce onto the bed, and I felt a cat walk across the bed. I turned on the light and saw nothing moving on the bedspread. I'm just sure it was Moonshadow, keeping me company. These visits happened on a regular basis.

A few weeks after his death, I was lonesome and got another silver Persian, but he had a more independent mindset and never slept on my bed, and I continued to feel my ghostly cat jump onto the bed after I turned off the light. 

I moved to Lexington then, a few months after that, I adopted a second cat, who was much more affectionate than the silver Persian. I quit feeling the cat pounce on the bed; I suspect it's because the second cat slept there.

Those two cats lived to be 12-14 years old and they passed away a few years ago... And Moonshadow is back. About once a month or so, I will turn off the light to go to sleep, and as soon as I am quiet, those soft paws jump on the bed."
"Visit From A Fallen Soldier","Minnesota","Family / Friends Visits","This story takes place around D-Day (June 1944). When my Grandpa was a young boy (no older than 10), his uncle was in WWII, and one of the thousands who died on the European beach fronts (not sure if Omaha or not). However, the story of his death also takes place in the bedroom of my young Grandad (we'll call him F). F told me this story personally. He was a very sincere man, and not one to lie about paranormal events.

It was very late in the night and F was in an upstairs attic/bedroom with his brother. The two shared a room and were well on their ways to sleep. F was awakened when he noticed his uncle (his mother's brother who was in the war) enter the room. His uncle came over to where he was laying and was attempting to give F pennies. He didn't know why pennies. 

A few moments later, F's mother walked into the room (was it instinct or coincidence? I don't know). She saw the scene which she knew was impossible: her brother was in the room interacting with F. Frightened and shocked, she exclaimed, ""---, what are you doing here?!"" The soldier then turned and left the room (he either disappeared through the wall or walked past F's mom out the bedroom door).

It wasn't but a few days later when F's family received the news that her brother had been killed by opposing forces in Europe, the very same night both she and F saw him in the bedroom. 

I apologize for the unclean details in this story, as they were told by my Grandad and I can't remember exactly what was going through his mind at the time and he himself was young. Though, I think it is amazing that both him and my Great-Grandmother shared this experience (it really validates the encounter). My Mom tells me that both of them were very susceptible to the paranormal, which I why I believe they both saw my great uncle, while F's brother who was in the same room did not. 

I am still curious as to why my great uncle was offering my Grandad pennies of all things. They were not poor."
"WWII Shipyard Worker?","Washington","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","For ten years I rented a tiny home in a neighborhood built to house workers of industrial shipyards. These houses pretty much all look alike. From my living room a double window looks out exactly over the cement porch steps. At some point I became aware, in certain afternoon light, of someone ""coming home"" up to the steps. It was like catching a couple frames out of place when you screen a reel of film, and the out-of-place frames showed ""someone"" coming up, or up to, the empty daylight steps. With no sound to draw my gaze, I would look up to the window just in time to see the slight passing profile of someone arriving. At first, I would hop up to go look, but I did not after a while. I saw this a few times a year. My dogs never reacted even a blink or snork to these ""sightings"" of mine. What I saw was not frightening to me, just confusing. 

I did ask my landlady if she had seen anything like that. She said no, but did not discount my question, or have any further explanation. My landlady's father had inherited her the house, she lived there when attending college. My few housemates were mostly too emotionally unstable to ask about this type of thing, as I did not want to scare them and their rent away. Maybe that is how the landlady felt about me-HA!

Even if I was staring straight out the window, whenever I saw this ""person"" arrive it was like seeing peripherally. Like a slant of light in a reflection, but with form and purpose. That sounds a bit odd. Oh well, I am just trying to best describe what I saw. I ""saw"" this head/shoulders in fleeting profile, as a brief glimpse, from different angles and distances. Usually when sitting, most often in summer. I felt it was someone ""coming home"" because their posture had that feeling of routine labour. When I'd look up, it almost felt like I was expecting them. I cannot say that I saw anyone or anything specific, but after a while I knew it seemed masculine and maybe wore a hat of some sort. None of the dogs ever once alerted to what I saw, or acted as if a person were there at all. This may have been the strangest part of what happened, and why I was quick to search for whoever had managed to sneak up, at first.

I believe YGS is the best place to mention this experience, as you readers are so helpful to compare and analyze even mundane occurrences such as this. My questions about these events are for those who have ""seen"" a spirit before, and of the actual optical function of their sighting: was the spirit A) present before their eyes or B) seen in their mind but ""projected"" in the space? Does it ever look like a reflection or angle of light, but where none can be? Could ""seeing"" one spirit happen different ways, differently in seasonal light changes? I felt, more than saw, that it was a man coming home after work, but I know I saw somebody coming up when no one was ""really there"" to physically see. 

I get why people lose their minds trying to reason this stuff out. How can one find explanations for something so difficult to describe? Why did my brain notice these repeated incidents? I do not feel that I can say I have seen a ghost, because it was more like seeing a reflection or feeling- repeatedly triggered by catching a certain movement in my field of sight. Maybe my curiosity also sounds odd.

Prior to the WWII era development, that land and woods had been taken as property by an Officer (Harney?) from nearby Fort Vancouver. I am unsure where any of that officer's buildings stood. A massive white Oak in the backyard adjoining mine would have been eighty or so at the time. The house and lot where I lived got sold to the bank, so who knows if any of it still stands.

I lived alone mostly. My two big dogs kept me safe. Boxers have a deep serious tone to their bark which let's me know immediately if there is a stranger. They would jump up with their front paws on that front window sill, and make great sport of those cheeky enough to visit our quiet street. If anyone stopped by, the neighbors' poodle would help with the game, yipping from behind a fence while my dogs waited until the person was right outside. Boxers live for games like this, and never missed an opportunity to bark and claw at a visitor's head through the window."
"Visit From Grandad/dreams?","Minnesota","Family / Friends Visits","This is my first story. I'm not regularly affected by the paranormal, but it makes the experiences I do have very memorable. I'd really appreciate any input (positive/helpful comments only please) about what I've experience. Thank you!

A blurb about myself: I'm 20 years old and currently in college. I've lived in Minnesota my whole life. Interestingly, my stories mainly involve experiences with my Grandparents (both sets)! 

For this story, I will be focussing on my maternal Grandparents. It is important to know that they have lived in Florida for most of my life. My Mom, brother and I would visit them every other year/they would visit us. Aside from letters and phone calls, that was about it. The times we had together were always great. It is also important to know that my maternal Grandfather (and his mother) had always been very open to the paranormal. By this I mean that for some reason, they attracted paranormal energy of some sort more than others. This is just what he and my mother had told me. I will post one of his experiences separately. 

This particular experience of mine really begins sometime in March of 2016. I was a Freshman in college and really struggling with school. I hadn't done well keeping in touch with my Grandparents (which again, wasn't unusual especially with being busy). So I was surprised one night to have a dream that I was a child again at an old neighborhood park, and my Grandma was wandering aimlessly trying to tell me something distressing. I woke up and though it was weird. 

A few nights later, I had another dream that my Grandma was a ghost. She guided me into the garage of my old house, and said, ""There's so much I wanted to tell you..."" and was crying. The next day, I was worried of course and asked my Mom if everything was okay with my grandparents. She said things were fine. 

It couldn't have been a week later that my Grandad had a stroke and fell, causing him to go to the hospital. My Mom spent almost the rest of the month in Florida with my Grandma, helping her out and taking care of my Grandad in the crummy hospitals. 

In April, we found out that my Grandad wasn't going to make it. My brother and I flew down to say our last goodbyes. I was very close to my Grandad, who always told me stories and made me laugh non-stop, so I was horribly sad to see him in such a state of illness in the hospice. My brother and I had school, so after 2 or 3 days we had to return. My Grandad had not yet died but we'd said our goodbyes, so ""L"" (my brother) and I flew back to MN alone. 

A night later, I had a very lucid dream that I walked up some wooden steps. A the top there was a wooden door and hallway. When I got to the door, it opened and I could see that it contained bright white light. Out of the door stepped my Grandad. He was old, but healthy, wearing a neon green tank top he always wore when he visited, and shorts. Right away, he hugged me. He communicated peace to me through his hug. But also, I heard him speak into my mind (?) saying that everything was okay and that he loved me. Then after he hugged me, he let go and I watched him walk down the hallway. That was where the dream for sure ended, but I didn't wake up right then. I know that I was in some kind of deep sleep trance until I woke up in the morning. 

He had died, and I'm not sure if it was the exact same time as my dream, but my Mom told me the news the next day. 

I'm trying to figure out if that dream was his spirit saying goodbye to me. I surely feel like it was. I will admit that it was unlike any dream I had before. Something about the way I could actually feel him hugging me made it seem so real, and the way I fell out of the dream experience was unlike waking up the way I normally do from dreams. I was at peace. 

I'm also wondering what people think about the dreams I had about my Grandma right before this very stressful period in time happened. Is it at all related to the events that would occur? And if so, why was my Grandma crying for me and why was my Grandad not in either of the dreams? As a side note, my Grandpa has been phsycially visited by a deceased loved one at their death (a story I will tell later). I wonder if it is a theme in our family or if I am simply overthinking it.

Sorry this was so long! Let me know if you have any questions or plotholes I can clear up!"
"Peripheral Vision","Oklahoma","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","This won't really be a long experience, but just a few more things to add.

Yesterday, 3 times I saw something moving in my peripheral from the right side. The first 2 were quite quick and looked smaller than the usual height they have been, from any thing I've seen before.

The first one moved across the backdoor from left to right. The second Across my bay window in my kitchen nook. The windows have blinds and curtains that cover those.

I have 2 back doors, because of the add on room that I call the lounge room. The lounge room is off the kitchen, with 2 steps that lead down into it, and a foot across from those is the backdoor that leads to the backyard.

I had the backdoor open where I had a clear view of the backyard, When I saw this first fleeting small thing. I'll admit it could've been a small bird just outside the door, or even my puppy running across the yard. But for the time it took, and what appeared to me to be dull in color and closer than usual, it seems sort of improbable.

The second fleeting thing... The reason I say thing is because it was too fast to see if it was a shadow. I was in my hallway, cleaning the built-in vanity which was at this point covered with hairbrushes, lotions and various hair products.

I have a clear view of the bay window, only being about 10 feet away.

Yesterday was sort of cloudy, not too windy and a quiet day when I saw the fleeting thing. Its height was around 2 feet in height, moving again from left to right in my peripheral once again. I have become used to these, when they happen I shrug it off and keep my day going.

Now onto the third time this happened. Again I was standing in front of the vanity. My husband had made it home and was laying on the couch resting on his phone, 2 of my boys were sitting on the other couch watching TV and the other two kiddos were downstairs playing a game.

I saw my husband get up, walk across the living room and towards the kitchen, but what I noticed was the shorts he had on were of a different color and design. In reality, he had on black shorts with a red and white stripe down the side of the shorts. The spirit imitating him had on a tan sort of color shorts and the design on the side was a faded orange and lime green going down the side.

I saw him walk across the room, and it didn't hit me for a few seconds because the way it walked across the room was completely normal so I looked away, and BOOM! I instantly looked around the little wall that hides the vanity, and saw my husband still laying on the couch.

I know it wasn't him because I had given him the shorts to put on, and he doesn't own any shorts of that color with any sort of design on the side. And to confirm, I asked him ""Hey, did you just go into the kitchen for something""? He said no, and continued on with whatever he was doing on his phone. My oldest looked at me he knew I saw something.

A week and ago he asked me if I had let our pup Tucker into the room with them early that morning. I told him no, that I had kept him in the lounge all night, so he wouldn't wake them up. He said ""Mom, I could've sworn you put him in the room."" I asked why and he said he thought it was strange when he woke up that morning and Tucker wasn't in the room with him.

Now Tucker is a big dog and when he gets on or off of anything he moves it. Same with his bed. Not only is that strange, but he said he saw me let him in and felt Tucker get on the bed and lay down. So when he woke up and turned over, fully expecting to wake Tucker up, was quite the shock when he wasn't there."
"My Night Last Night","Indiana","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","NEED HELP PLEASE! So I have always believed in the supernatural but NEVER HAVE I EVER experienced something until last night. 

Around 2:20AM my boyfriend woke me up and told me he was going to go in the back room with his mom. His brother and sister had come over to hang out and he was going to go see them just in the other room. I told him to put on a child's show called Phineas and Ferb for me before he went into the other room. I call it a good show to help me not have bad dreams. Also just so no one says I was sleeping or dreaming, I remember where I was in the show and what episode I was watching. 

About 7 minutes after my boyfriend went into the other room something BLATANTLY SMACKED ME! Yes SMACKED ME IN THE FACE ENOUGH TO MAKE MY HEAD TURN. Keeping my head turned, I felt like this thing was still there and I felt like it was behind me. I could not turn my head to look for another good 5 minutes and when I did, I got the hell out of there.

About 2:30AM I went to the back room and told my boyfriend and his family. They told me that was weird because my boyfriend's mom was just telling them about how one day me and my boyfriend were going into our bed room and she saw a shadow (NOT OURS) follow us. 

Even though I told them this, not knowing they were talking about that and not knowing anything about the shadow incident, they think I will ""be okay"" but I'm terrified to be in my own room alone. I'm scared to sleep. I don't know what I am to do. I am 8 months pregnant and if it can smack me, I feel like it could choke me and if it can choke me I could die. 

I have never been so scared in my life, never felt so helpless like there is something that can hurt me and there is nothing I can do about it. I need help I am so scared!"
"House Recently Built Near Unmarked Graves","Oregon","A Haunted Life","To begin, I'm not a professional story teller or writer. This stuff did happen and I absolutely detest people who make up stories or deceive for attention.

In 2002 my mom and stepdad bought a house in the neighborhood I grew up in (after living in an apartment and splitting custody with my dad for 5-6 years). The location I'll keep unnamed. The neighborhood was planned and all of it was built on old orchards and abandoned farm land which goes way back to the old Oregon settlers, as this was the valley down from the mountains. 

For about 2 years we never noticed anything strange or weird, muchless even thought about our 4 year old house being haunted or anything like that. 

I believe the first activity happened over summer time. My brother, friend, and I were at my dad's house, which was a few miles away. My brother went back to my mom's to grab something but he never came back. Later we found out from my mom (my brother doesn't talk about thing that scare him) that my brother (let's call him Jake) had gone up the stairs and was going to his room in the dark (it was night) and he heard a young girl's voice say ""Hey Jake"" from the bathroom which was adjacent the hallway to his room. He apparently heard it loudly and very clear and sprinted into his room, slammed the door, and slept with the lights on. The next day he'd asked my mom if it was her and she denied being awake at the time. Things became more concentrated after the incident with my brother and would continue for another 10 years on and off.

Our friend Tony said while he was sleeping in our game room upstairs (largest open space area in the house) he felt someone stroking his hair and heard breathing. He thought it was us messing with him and had gotten up, realized the TV was shut off because it was pitch black, and he was so freaked out he ran downstairs and slept on the couch in the living room. At the time I was 16 and my brother and Tony were 15.

A few months after that little stuff I started to notice things in the game room when the door was open. The small hallway upstairs was perpendicular to the game room and if you wanted to go downstairs you had to walk towards the room and take a right down the stairs. I started noticing things that were blacker than black walking back and forth in the already dark room. At night with the shades down that room was extremely dark and to see things moving back and forth was terrifying. It almost seemed like it were groups of entities walking back and forth; this was before I ever heard about shadow people.

A couple weeks later my brother and I were watching TV late at night downstairs and my brother had passed out. After about 20 minutes, I saw movement in the darkness of the stairwell which was right across from the living room where we were. I fixated on the movement and saw something in a light colored robe slowly sliding down the stairs as if it were floating not walking. I saw a hand or something like it stretched out on the railing which faced me. Initially it scared me and then I thought it might be my mom because she wears a robe at night and also has medium length dark hair. Unfortunately that comfort didn't last but a second and then whatever it was just faded into nothing at the bottom of the stairs. I was already shaking my brother by this point. He didn't really care what I told him I saw and didn't believe me, but it was comforting to gave someone awake with me then.

Things started getting weirder in the house. I noticed my cat always fixating on something in the upper corner of my room, like something was floating around, or talking to her. It freaked me out and anytime she would start doing it, I'd kick her off my bed! 

One night my own mother woke me up at 2 AM. You know what she asked me? I was 18 at the time. She asks in a very terrified demeanor (my mom doesn't lie and when she's afraid it's gotta be truly terrifying) ""I need you to check under my bed."" Of course, unlike any other brave accountable son, I said ""Yea, no."" 

She wouldn't tell me why initially but pressing her on the whole deal, she eventuality told me she woke up because she heard screaming. This was no dream because she said she continued to hear it after she woke up but it wasn't from outside or downstairs. She said she heard it underneath her headboard. Almost as if it was ""someone screaming like they were being dragged to hell"", those were her words. We both checked and didn't see anything of note and I can't remember if she went downstairs or not for the rest of the night.

Often at night I would be up and usually make myself dinner late. Almost every night for a few months I would get a really anxious feeling being in the kitchen. What it felt like was as if someone strong, angry, big, and terrifying was yelling at you at the top of their lungs to get the f**k out of there. Like you were definitely hated and did not belong there. It was awful when it would happen. Perfectly normal kitchen one second and boom, hateful sinister environment the next. One time I saw what looked like a young kid walk across the kitchen archway; that was unsettling.

More weird things started happening and these were very frequent; loud freakin' bangs, crashing, and chaos. We had a few cats in the house so anytime one of these crashes happened they'd run up or downstairs depending where the noise originated. 

Two times that stick out were once I was downstairs watching TV and my mom was upstairs. All of a sudden I heard the loudest crash I've ever heard in a house coming from the garage. It sounded like all the shelving on the wall fell over and crashed on top of glass and metal. The sound shook the house! This was no earthquake, I've had it happen before and this wasn't a bang. This sounded like everything was falling off the walls. I quickly ran to the garage door fully expecting to see carnage but not a single thing was touched or had fallen. I inspected and searched around. My mom and I were pretty freaked out. 

Another time I was again downstairs and heard upstairs what sounded like everything in my bathroom being thrown to the floor and all the soap crashing in the tub. Followed by the cats farting down the stairs. Again I ran upstairs, thinking the cats knocked all my stuff over but there wasn't a single thing out of place. 

A few years after I moved out, my mom and I decided to do some EVP. My mom actually asked the questions. She asked if it was a boy or girl, clearly I recorded something saying ""boy"". If anyone wants the recording I can provide it as I still have it from 2008! To be honest I can't remember all the questions but we got other responses in a male voice. Of note, it was just my mom and I and if I spoke it was obvious. There were no other people. I let the device record in the room after we left and you can hear tons of noises like someone is moving around in the room. 

After I moved out of the house into my first apartment, I felt like whatever was at the house actually attached itself to me. I still feel that way to this day, I constantly have cold winds in my house around me at night when there isn't a window open or I'll hear voices of people that aren't in the house calling me. I hate it. 

Anyway, back the first apartment. The first and only experience I had there was the first couple days my roommate and I moved in. There was a Duck game going and I was getting on my laptop to find out what the score was (this was 2007 and smartphones weren't as common as they are nowadays, plus internet was terrible on them!) and I heard the nastiest, most guttural growl come from my room while I was sitting in the living room. We didn't have cable yet and I didn't have any TV on or music. It literally sounded like one of those Demon Dog/gargoyles from Ghostbusters. It scared the sh*t out of me! I remember the sound to this day, don't know why it happened, but it never happened again.

A few years go by and the most activity me and my roommate have is him saying he sometimes hears someone walking around in my room or in our kitchen and he thinks it's me but I was never home when he heard these things. Actually this kind of stuff happens a lot even now. My wife says she heard me walking upstairs or fiddling around in my record room but I'm either not home or asleep downstairs. Just creepy stuff.

I eventually had to move back to my mom's place after my roommate decided to move home to save money. My mom later moved out and my girlfriend, who is now my wife, moved in. She isn't one to admit to seeing things but one time she saw something in our bathroom mirror while she was doing her hair and she refuses to tell me even to this day exactly what it was. She'll never admit when she's scared, even horror movies. She'll get up and go to bed acting like the movie is dumb when it's actually scaring her. So one day maybe she will feel up to it. She was vulnerable and scared when she told me about it but quickly zipped her lips and now denies ever saying anything about it.

Anytime I wasn't living there nothing would happen. Nowadays nothing happens anymore but I feel like whatever was there is with me now. Popping up briefly here and there. 

I actually had a spiritualist tell me that something was partially possessing my life or something negative was attached to me that wasn't a part of me. I went through prayer with a few spiritualist healers once when I was 21. It was pretty weird at first but I felt it, felt like something left me for awhile and my life felt more positive. Eventually whatever it was has slowly infiltrated me again. 

Anyway, feel free to message me if you can."
"I Am Christian. What Was This?","Georgia","Old Hags / Night Attacks / Sleep Paralysis","Please approve this. I am a Christian and need help. I am a woman by the way, in college.

I have had sleep paralysis only a handful of times. They have been terrifying experiences but don't last very long. I begin speaking in tongues (something I can't even do in real life) and the spirits scream and go away.

However, today was different. I was sleeping on my side but halfway on my back and kept going in and out of sleep. I could feel the paralysis coming; however, I ignored it because I was enjoying the dream. (A person I am no longer close to was in it.) 

Fast forward: I am awake but can't move. However, it felt that I had been drugged (I never felt like this in my prior experiences.) A naked lady and a random man came into my room. I closed my eyes and pretended to be asleep. They proceeded to take out a suitcase and the man said something about cutting my head off. He started doing it and I felt it but the druggy feeling muted the pain. The woman sat on the bed with her back to me. 

I was trying to wiggle my toes, anything but I could not. I randomly asked if I could sleep with the woman (I really don't know why I asked this but my logic was that it would give me some sort of feeling to sit up and end the dream). 

Some things occurred (editor deletion) but it felt real enough for me to be able to sit up and end the dream. 

What was this? And how did it happen? It felt so real but these were not ""demons"" like my previous experiences these looked like humans. I also did not start praying or speaking in tongues. Help me. Am I in danger?"
"He Kissed Me","Missouri","Apparitions / Voices / Touches","My name is Shauna and this is my first paranormal story submission (ever). I have many stories that are short, to the point, and just unexplainable. 

It's was a summer Sunday afternoon. I rarely get the chance to nap so when opportunity presented, I took advantage. 

A little back story; My husband Gabriel ALWAYS kisses my forehead, sometimes when saying goodbye before work in the morning but ALWAYS before we fall asleep, whether we had a disagreement earlier or not.

 I was sleeping on my side, not quite asleep but almost there. I heard, rather, felt as if someone walked into my room. The presence was so strong I turned to see who it was. No one. I begin to fall asleep again and that's when I simultaneously heard the sound ""smack"" of a kiss as well as the impression of lips on my forehead. I jumped, opened my eyes and felt confused. No one was in my room. My husband was outside mowing the lawn. The sensation of lips pressed against my forehead lingered for at least 10 seconds. I didn't feel threatened but I no longer felt the need to take a nap and all I could was lay there for a while trying to comprehend what just happened.

 Gabriel said he was outside the entire time, besides, if he would have come in for something and wanted to leave his infamous forehead kiss, I would have seen him standing there or walking away.

 Every now and again Gabriel jokes that no one better be kissing his wife, ghost or not! This was the first time I had been touched by a presence or ghost. I did sense that it was male. Nothing like this has happened again."
"Do I Miss It Being Here? - No!","Indiana","Ouija Board / Seances","I always felt something unsettling in the 110-year-old house I moved into with my husband & babies in 1991, especially in the basement, which has crumbly field stone walls, low, unfinished ceilings, and is creepy even when sunlight is shining through the small windows. I always felt watched in the basement, felt hostility coming at me. My arm hairs stood on end and I usually rushed up the stairs because it felt as if I were being pushed or pursued. I could only do laundry down there during the day. There were also cold spots in the rooms closest to the basement door. My husband laughed at me, so I didn't mention it to anyone else. We divorced 4 years later, and a year after, my new boyfriend actually brought up to me that he felt something, and also heard the ""whooshing"" sound that only I had been hearing - around 1 am, about 4-5 times/wk. By then, my kids weren't babies any more, and they also avoided the basement. 

After we got married, we had the electric service upgraded; my husband did most of it but hired an electrician to tie everything into the new breaker box in the basement. We were all out of town and had given the electrician a key; he was doing the work after his regular job, in early evening, with a battery-operated floodlight. When we returned from out trip, the work was not done, but the electrician's tools and floodlight were all near the breaker box. The key was left on the table by the front door. When we called, he said something in our basement didn't want him there, and could we leave his tools on the front porch. The 2nd electrician came during the day, and it was fine. 

Three years after that, we were having the attic over half of the house demolished and a 2nd half-story added. While this construction was going on, somebody loaned us an Ouija board, which we used after the kids were asleep. Our Dutch exchange student and his friend from France were there as well. My husband and I had the placket, and the students wrote down what was spelled out. 

""Stop this, the noise is killing me!"" was the first thing it said. Nobody understood what he was talking about at first. We asked questions about gender (male) and place of birth (Belgium). I thought my husband was moving the darn thing. He thought I was. But then, the Dutch student started asking questions in his own language, because in Belgium they speak either Dutch or French. He/it answered. In Dutch. I do not speak Dutch. My husband does not speak Dutch. This was the moment when I knew, really knew, that it wasn't just a creepy basement and maybe my imagination. I had always left room for doubt so I didn't have to feel, you know, like one of those people who believes they have a ghost. I honestly DID have a ghost! It scared me, made me feel sick to my stomach and cold all over. 

A few more questions were answered: date of birth, (1816); came to America, (1836); did it like my husband (no); did it like me and the kids (yes). It would respond to the Dutch student but wanted the French kid to leave, hated the French because they had killed his father in 1830. It spelled out a long sentence about the construction being a big problem, then another (""the noise is killing me""). This was all in Dutch. When we asked him when he died, the placket went off the edge of the board, and that was it. He would respond no more. I put the Ouija Board on the porch outside and gave it back to its owners the next day. I will not allow another in my house. Ever. The hair-prickly feelings, cold spots, and 'whooshing' noises all stopped. He has never come back - we think because of the construction. 

The house was ghost-free for 13 years. When somebody else ""moved in,"" it was a far more expressive entity (and that's a whole different story), and was upstairs this time. We smudged the house with burning sage, spoke sternly to it, and spread salt trails around the perimeter of each room. When none of that worked, we called in a Catholic Priest. And it worked. He had to come back 6 months later, a completely different entity. It worked again. We have been ghost-free now for 6 years."
"A Passover Guest?","New York","Family / Friends Visits","Here's a good one. I was born and raised Jewish and celebrate Passover as per tradition. For those not familiar to the story. Jewish people do not eat bread or any bread products for 8 days each April due to the suffering of their ancestors. 

I had been so busy this week that I had forgotten to cleanse my house of all bread products as the tradition implies. There was a big bag of cookies (non-kosher for Passover) that I left out on my desk from before the holiday started. Slipping my mind that it was now Passover, I ate some out of this bag last night before bed. Thought nothing of the fact it was ""cheating"". 

Fast forward to 5AM, I wake up to a bright light and a very mysterious sound. The sound was like a ringing in my ears, but a different kind of ring. It was almost like someone was blowing a tinny, high-pitched whistle in my head. Really can't explain it beyond that. 

The light was from my PC computer screen. It was still pitch dark otherwise. I had closed my monitor at bedtime and the only way for it turn on would be for someone to sit down, turn the monitor box on which requires a bit of physical force, and then physically move the mouse at my desk. I live completely alone, and there was no external force that could have got the screen open. It made me sit up and definitely got my attention. 

The first thought that came through my head is that this is a warning. I checked my heart rate, checked my throat for any possible obstruction. Nothing out of the ordinary, I'm fine. 

Then I remembered the night before eating those cookies. Now it makes a lot of sense. It's possible that since my family was together for a seder meal, that this was a family member just checking in to remind me to keep kosher. Is that possible? Has anyone had that kind of whistling or ringing in their ears before as the sign of someone's presence?"
